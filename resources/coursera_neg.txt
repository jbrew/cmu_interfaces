Why there is no "minus one" star?
I had already completed the first week of the course and the first week in this course.
This specialization is advertised as one does not require programming experience.
You are shown a demo of how the solution should look in the assignment videos, and then you are told you actually have to build something different than what you were shown.
The questions were very complicated and not stated in the Lectures
), the pointless and useless doodles, smilies and whatsoever, wasting my time by watching you dispose your teabag/drinking tea or coffee/talking about your mug/etc., why do you even need to drink in a 20 minute-or-less video.
Half of what they show, you are told to ignore.
Might be good for someone looking for a casual overview?I really wanted to like this course, and was excited about the series.
very basic course.
One last thing- the course says it's a five week program, but there are only 4 weeks.
While I was able to fail my way forward through it, it was completely overwhelming, and overly painful.
No explaining just throwing around numbers.
Submission is buggy and final assignment is confusing.
I will probably pay at the end, but I want to take the class first.
Not technical enough.
I am sorry but the Prof. doesn't know how to attract students to be more curious.
Учителя Павла Кочкина, о которых сам он с гордостью рассказывает - Норбеков и Лапин.
Also, in the discussion forum, I haven't received answer to the questions that I'm posting(since right now it's holiday season, I can exempt them from not replying).
I knew I could carry on with this irritation and still get the course certificate for which I've paid for, but then there is no point in wasting time in which the explanation is not clear.
Shaky camera, this long walk and football kicking with a brain on the football field???
It is possible to do the homework without it, but it is EXTREMELY difficult to do so.
low-level content for people with no teaching background
This was a good course, but I would recommend people wait until all the rest of the courses are available before starting this course and beginning the specialisation.
The lecturers have poor vocabulary and pronunciation and the videos are very repetitive.
These individual courses contained data focused problems and gave a general overview of the specific field.
However, the final "Capstone" project was entirely disappointing and something I even plan to complain to Coursera about.
Focusing on rbg values and image thingies too much and making me feel uncomfortable at quizzes after watching all those lectures are the main reasons of giving 1 star.
The use of external tool for no good reason + the lack of written summary makes the course really hard to follow.
The instructor was doing things at breakneck speed with little explanation.
Help was not forthcoming and I eventually unsubscribed from the course
As it currently stands, this course is a joke.
For the $59 price of the course, expected more.
As an example, there's no discussion of the difference between WordPress.
org and WordPress.
com.
Does very little to actually help you learn JAVA.
No practical knowledge learnd and no clear examples of the topics.
I only took this Course because I was forced too and I don't think it matters what you eat it's just how much you eat.
I'm just dropping the course.
I wish I had known before I signed up.
His speeches lacked structure and focus.
It is very interesting, but we have to face problems with Teradata, I have not been able even to log in, and a lot of students are in the same situation, and the problem persists, even in the duedate of the test.
I can't believe this is the type of school John Hopkins is to produce a course of this quality, but I guess I have to.
I found this course is very much theoritical.
This review is just a summary of what I felt about the first two weeks of this course.
The briefest of comments on potentially interesting people or topics, but no links to enable those to be followed up.
Also, it did not present historical literature and research on the subject.
It was confusing and hard to understand the professor did not go at a pace i found helpful.
I don't mean to insult anyone or criticize the method of teaching and I am not doubting the credentials of instructors.
Also, I have been using xcode and Swift for 8 months now and producing some really good work, but I could only get 3/7 on your quiz because you have written questions with the purpose of tricking people instead of reinforcing or checking knowledge of the content.
When you teach a new application, consider introducing the interface first.
It is regretful that I must again leave a one star review.
I realize this is the first time this course was offered, so there are some issues that need to be worked out.
Dato tool does not even install properly.. so n´makes no sense to continue with the course.
Course also focuses a lot on the history when it would be more relevant to look to the future.
If any of those describe you then this is not the course for you.
(Maybe good for school students.)
It is boring and you hardly learn anything.
TOO DIFFICULT
Given this, again, I feel this course would be better served in another specialization about UI Design or for software design best-practices.
That is my .02.
The worst professor in this specialization.
There is a disconnect between the video lectures and the assignments/quizzes.
Although the TA's do occasionally provide answers to questions.
This course does not provide a foundation of knowledge for inferential statistics so much as present several equations and functions and describe how one might use them.
Please, someone from Coursera get a hold of me and help me resolve this ridiculous problem.
Instructor never gives an overview of the architecture/data flow/structure of Active Record or Action Pack, instead describes the syntax of a handful of functions.
I really wonder why this should be a course at an University.
Very bad Because you need 3 persons to evaluate you every week and often this persons is not educated or gives a score zero for all .
This course is not good in giving lessons with examples that will help a with studying for the quizzes.
Unfortunately, the technology adds almost nothing beneficial to the class and is probably to blame for the sheer lack of quality in the rest of the class.
In fact, the entire Capstone feels like it was so haphazardly put together that it can only be described as the most contrived beta-test I've ever been a part of.
This course was not mind numbingly boring as hell
That meant it took a lot of time figuring out what exactly was needed to complete the assignment and how to do it.
Disappointing after a great first course.
Also I found the instructor's presentation style to be too abstract.
This "Capstone" hardly related to the previous four courses, and it is a scam that this course cost $99.
Non-reponsive teaching assistants.
For that reason, recommend using the Stanford web site directly.
It's a lot of teacher talk with no substance.
If you are a first year primary school student, this course might be helpful, otherwise a complete waste of time.
Not much Interesting plus low level of difficulty
Unfortunately, the videos amount to the professor simply reading off Powerpoint slides with occasional quizzes in the video.
Teaching behaviourism in 2017 is scandalous.
In general, I think this course would have been more fulfilling if the documentation was appropriate.
give a calculator as an assignment to build while you never built one app in this course, i think its not an effective way to teach.
i generally think the course needs a lot of improvement as after week 1 the assignments and quizzes don't seem to relate to the course content.
But guess what?
I didn't understand very much of this course.
Pivot tables?
The exercise demands a lot of time to understand the document.
I am opting out.
Just overview of the common technologies.
No more than this.
Course is a little formulaic, had trouble making my submissions follow the structure outlined but still, I learnt some useful tips and actually got to just write something orderly.
Liked some of the visiting speakers (the third speaker who talked about character - mature lady, dark hair) was quite good.
Overall, it could be a great course but falls short because the videos proceed way too fast and without enough repetitions or even practice exercises to be able to remember the phrases afterwards.
The menotrs make things more stressful than they need to be because the dont give help or hints or clues.
I act as an analyst for my programmer husband.
The exercises lead you to the edge of a cliff, then push you off.
The "course" was little more than an afternoon's worth of seminars.
In fact, I think the majority of useful assistance came from other students who had run in to the same issue(s).
I'm having to force myself to finish it.
There is no logical development of the course content - it's all disconnected facts told one after another.
Another factor is the delivery.
Spent a lot of time beginning to study.
But a lot of the "teaching" is ill suited for someone looking to learn with a minimal statistical background.
I attempted to take this course because I really wanted to learn more about the US Constitution and how it applies to my daily life.
It is frustrating to get such a response when you have paid a hefty much for the course.
It had such high hopes, but they fell short flat.
Unable to cover a week's material in a week
It´s a requirement to put down a payment to take the quiz
Coming to R with some background in statistics and SQL, but lacking programming experience, I assumed this would be an introduction.
The narration is very dull and therefore hard to follow.
Far too academic.
I have absolutely no idea how could this become a separate course - and one spread over 4 weeks.
I soon got bored with the simplistic solutions, lack of challenge, and frankly, a condescending attitude.
All learning done through the course remains largely a theoretical knowledge if a student isn't able to apply it in his/her job.
When the instructor for the course expresses amazement at the level of difficulty people are expressing in the forums that tells you a lot about how out of touch he is with what he is teaching and what is really required prerequisite knowledge.
There is minimal actual instruction in excel-most often concepts are taught much like Khan Academy, on a digital blackboard.
I am really disappointed with the content of this course.
If one of the answers was wrong there was no information which one it was.
I am still trying to understand the material by reading external articles on the course topics.
No response (at least, for days on end) when questions are posted on the forums
As I explained above, the course relies heavily on decade-old research but does not cover any developments since.
Too much statistics, too much coding and inadequate instruction.
I feel I'm about to quit, and this is the second week...
Most rational believers however could still hold onto their beliefs because the arguments were very weak.
A better title for the course would be "why there is no soul".
You need strong statistical skills to understand it.
Explanations are sketchy and not well paced.
I agree that defining a few words is important but here it's just too much.
The articles that were limited were actually somewhat helpful.
Some of the content was new and interesting but overall I din't think it was a good use of my time.
Learning was chaotic, confusing, and fast paced.
Don't take this course unless you have a programming background.
The teacher was distracted and I had some issues in following her.
I did not find the course very good.
I find hand written derivations, even when the handwriting is a little sloppy, much easier to follow than a static page of formulas plus a sound track.
That's a lie, you have to study much more than that unless if you know a little R programming.2.)
I strongly feel that such activities should be performed only outside the course work when we try to solve real world problems.
I hardly learned anything, except for that there is something called Galaxy, we do some analysis by pushing buttons, using preconfigured tools.
The videos themselves were divided into two sections -- first a theoretical or classroom like section and a second a lab/programming section going over some coding in Python.
There are 24 graded quizzes in total, to pass the course you need to pass all 24 of them!
Could you at least use a pen with ink that we can read when you're not in R?
Not the level of a reputable University.
The information content is close to zero.
This is a direct ground for further body-shaming.
The course is unfortunately very primitive and lacks further user-friendly design and review.
Disorganized.
very very bad session
I have met with nothing but frustration with this course.
The course content is very poorly explained.
It is not possible to finish this course without learning from other sources on the web, materials attached to this course are not enough to understand the subject.
Or first Basic Statistic than R.
I really enjoy the class.
First of all this courser is less understandable than "The Swift Programming Language" free book from Apple.
I have wasted a lot of time resubmitting my assignments due to technical issues.
I don't think instructor has any idea of target audience.
please consider canceling it immediatly or having me or a real lama as the teacher
Unfortunatelly I did not get anything from this course.
As a data architect / ETL developer, SQL is something I'm familiar with and use it everyday and then I realized that the instructor couldn't explain a nested query well.
Verbose, wandering.
Databases very difficult to work with, and badly programmed.
There were no programming assignments, quizes and exams were not challenging at all and some questions were really confusing.
It could easily be eliminated
The quizzes are just plain dumb containing questions like "what article was written by authors x, y, z".
**My initial rating for this course alone was 4 stars, but due to the lack of effort and information in the 2nd course of this specialization I have to give this 1 star as these courses are all tied together.
very tough to catch up.
It is severely lacking concrete relevant real world examples - in the beginning of each lecture would be super - motivating each technique.
Very basic and videos are only 2 - 3 minutes.
The entirety of this course can be taught in a few sentences.
the content lacks any coherency.
Everything we did in seven weeks could have been taught in one or two.
There are too many threads and the it's not at all clear what to write about.
course teacher just repeats the information on the slides verbatim.
Additionally, flow of lectures seems scattered at times: concepts are introduced then not expounded upon.
Sadly, I enrolled into second course as well, and hoping that one will be better, so I wont have to go through refund hell.
Many of the lessons waste time gushing over what's coming next, but quite often the lesson itself feels weak and vague.
nothing more - well, thanks for that.
It is very very bad that only students assess the assignments.
The instructors overly explain simple concepts and talk about programming inbetween makes the course confusing then you get lost and quiz you on stuff that was not properly explaiuned
Good if you want to fall asleep.
For a learner this is of great value: honesty, transparency and realistic information - because I have to plan and schedule how much time I can take for learning!
did not like the course at all.
Lousy course.....
boring teacher
You are supposed to spend no matter than a few hours a week on the course.
I would have rated this course with 5 stars if it wasn't for the Autograder that marked the final assignment, which made that I didn't even get to pass the course, although, according to me and everyone I had contact with regarding this course, my code was correct!
However, none of the required assignments involve even the most primitive of problem solving skills or code writing abilities.
There was never any explicit message telling me what was required to complete the course and the information I did receive through the platform was just plain wrong.
Not recommended.
I don't think 99% of what was in the class was useful to me at all.
I can't reach the course contents because of new deadline that Coursera has invented
But in the end, you are suddenly required to do some practical C programming in Contiki (an embedded OS), which you need to spend some time to figure out quite a number of practical issues just for a successful run.
I was very excited when I heard about this course, but the amount of work and frustration just to get started programming in Scala has been obscene.
There are no coding exercises until the final assignment, which is poorly-described and requires the student to self-teach using outside sources.
There are app specializations in Coursera that appear much better-designed.
The video lectures are poorly done, including errors and misstatements that could have been edited out, but it appears that no one bothered to edit the raw footage before uploading it.
There is not so much instruction as an overview.
Too general course.
I am a statistician who works primarily with R, with some Python for the things Python is better for.
Hence I even have to place myself in another slot because I could not finish the assignment.
When we are stuck in a problem, we are not able to proceed further.
Shouldn't be included in this specialization.
For someone who is not familiar with inferential statistics, this course is too compact.
I found the course content to be too simple, hence uninteresting.
Hardly anything is explained very clearly.
Living in Europe and used to cooking healthy food for my family everyday I have not learned anything new!
Please make JavaScript part simple for beginners.
The only time that is mentioned is when they touch on plugins, where they say you can't use them if you started with WordPress.
com!
This course needs a total overhaul; in its current state it is a detriment to both Coursera and the Wharton Online brand.
Before.
But I failed.
It needs agile presentations, better, infographics, graphics and design and to be much more flexible and fun.
I have not finished it but it does not make me get involved in the content even it is very interesting.
It needs a better script and handling of the information to be able to conect with new students.
don't waste your time
Assignments are ambiguously phrased and full of inconsistencies and typos.
In fact, having Coursera as a wrapper actually makes it more difficult to use, because additional clicks are required to access any resource, and nothing is accessible offline.
If you're like the rest of the population, then these lecture videos are useless.
I really like the lectures of this course.
You, as the course provider, should modify the assignment instead of asking the student to make changes.
There are serious issues in the IT infrastructure for this Online Course.
The instructor is really trying to show us that the real life data sets and databases are messy, but providing only written instructions for me it proved useless.
As a person who actually studied physics and knows a little about data science, I am literally baffled the way information presented and lectures speak.
I'm sorry
One more thing, the quizes and questions makes alot of silent and weird assumptions, often not even clearly relating to the lecture materials.
The titles are interesting and curious to read, but the language is presentation of ideas is not coherent.
In later lectures, there is similar dancing around the English Civil War, which is shocking, given its constitutional importance... and then lots of vague, hand-wavy references to European law.
but the extra is a bit heavy for me.
Does not have a strong emphasis on Excel skills and the statistics models provided seem to be randomly chosen and poorly explained.
The fact that they state you dont need to know this program and then require you to use it to complete tests is unacceptable.
Incorrect references, subtitles that do not follow the video.
Could you please help me out to understand when this courses will be available if not in near future , why are they taken money before the course is not ready to us.
Will probably save time rather than try to blindly (and frustratingly) explain code over and over again.
), but then goes DEEP into the weeds of regression and fails to explain how to apply these complex concepts to any real world application.
Save you time and skip this course.
It was not the best course I did in Coursera.
The expected answer from the questions are confusing.
this course is definitely NOT for beginners.
This is very frustrating if you invest a lot of time and recognize that all classmates proceeded in a different way.
Regular bullet text are more readable and technically more reliable.
I'm aware of my background of python is still not strong enough so I thought it's probably just me not able to learn it fast enough.
But then I watched the tutorial about SQL.
Videos way too short, annoying music/animations, lots of stereotypes (floating 0's and 1's, really?
Due to family issues, I could not continue, but due to some weird policy, after purchasing this class, I could not drop.
Think it's good that for a programming course to show real time programming sometimes.
This is not a subjective personal experience.
This is just because of the unclarity of the final assignment.
I was able to complete the first course with ease, but the second course to this specialization felt incomplete and does not tie in very well with the how excel is used.
Details below.
The usegalaxy server was extremely slow.
I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that this is a poorly made course for building a thorough understanding of how these different Neural Networks actually function, and building a lower level understanding.
I am very disappointed, also cos I payed 30 dollars to a certificate.
The quality of the slides, video, and presentation in this course is much lower than those offered by this Speciality or coursera in general.
too fast paced, not suited for absolute beginners.
Poor help with instructions.
Moreover, students are supposed to learn these concepts to get a good grade from first quiz, although they know nothing about programming.
I had some programming experience, so I was already familiar with these subjects.
If I need it a peer review, I could just ask my colleagues at work.
The given introduction didn't help me to figure out how the grading system will look like.
I feel that going through this course was largely pointless, because I'm not going to retain much of the depth of the material in the long run.
Based solely on this experience, I'm NOT going to be recommending this specialization to anyone.
Way to easy
I was unhappy with this.
I did learn a bit of high level concepts, but when it comes to coding, the answers is always 'conveniently, my software does this for you'.
Pr David Germano is just reading text.
After the first week, the instructors never showed up to answer a single question in the forums.
I have paid for the course, havent enrolled due to my illness and there is nobody who can help me out with this.
Its a very nice project "Coursera" but still has too much to make up... what a pity.
Martin
I feel like I wasted $49.
This makes many videos boring but the slides are not provided so you really have to view the videos entirely.
Avoid this course, and head over to KhanAcedemy and complete their probability and statistics program and you will actually learn all the material in this course with a ton of examples and top class videos.
The course is very cheap.
They didn't explain what benefit adding the social media icons would have or how to link them.
But this doesn't actually show you how to build the intent.
"What was the point?"
It might be that I am too long in the tooth as an OO programmer that I cannot cope with the transition to functional programming.
I found the video lectures initially well structured and stepped nicely in to increasing complexity without losing me.
It was a struggle to sit through each video.
Incredibly disappointing!
:)
Comparing this to UC San Diego course videos is like night and day and really makes you realize the importance of quality production/natural flow of teaching.
I don't need math at this point as I don't know even how to build simple machine learning program.
After all, it's easy to walk away with a decent grade when there's no one knows what's going on.
Although the content is what you would hope to find in such a course, the delivery of it is outrageously bad.
It was somewhat difficult to understand the main lecturer.
Not to mention paying, you will be better off with Extra Credits...
I am a college instructor for Statistics, having graduated from a PhD program - even with that background I could not follow the instructor.
The course designer never considered the audience, and never identified the goals of this course.

fairgrieve@gmail.
com
Use very specific environment that cannot be used in practice in the the Real World.
For a much better course, use UC San Diego versions.
Didn't learn much from it.
not too good ,,because in assignments session they doesnt know what the right ans is, as in first assignment ,the ques is about circumference of circle as in google the exact ans is what they wronged it
This course needs to be completely redone with a focus on developing a student's intuition for the material and then support this intuition with basic examples that build as the course progresses.
How does this, in the least, help me make better investment decisions.
I'm done.
It is quite difficult to follow the teaching path and to enrich my knowledge.
I think it is a very bad way to make a course and often the pleasure to follow disappears leaving a sense of frustration and futility.
I arrived at the end of the course just because I'm doing the specialization otherwise I would have left in the middle of the first week.
I'm very disappointed.
There were unnatural pauses within sentences, causing the lectures to drag out longer than necessary and it was difficult to connect the thoughts of a sentence together because of the unnatural pauses.
$35 for this?
Little to no use for me.
You can easily look at the syllabus, go to the wikipedia and read the pages on presented subject and you will get the same knowledge.
Connection issues, latency, time outs.
Painful to watch and boring as hell!
At one point during the course I kept rating and rating my peersʻ assignments and the system would not accept it.
I gave up watching the videos after a while and try to pass anyway.
If however you think this is going to cost only $200 and you would have interaction with teachers and you would get a certification in about half a year...
I've done a few online courses on various, and for me, this is poor.
The total amount of time TA's spend answering questions is just really poor.
Unfortunately this course consists of the Professor reading his notes very quickly with rapid listing of concepts and very little time spent explaining complex topics.
The fact that the class uses GraphLab instead of pandas/numpy/sklearn should have been stated up frontThe course felt like an advertisement for the professor's toolkitIt was very disappointing that the equivalent standard workflow was not supported
I am dropping this course.
Week 1 was information anybody with a computer knows.
The videos cover the very basics and in order somebody to complete the assignments needs searching in the internet.
This is sadly a big let down for an excellent course theory wise.
Didn't learn anything new.
You really need prior coding experience to understand the training.
Then, in the first module, instructors talk about polymorphism, inheritance and abstraction.
Instead only a very detailed and specialized answer is accepted.
"Kudos to Chris and his team!
Needs to clarify more on it's work.
The projects were graded by peers, but the rubric was nonsensical.
this guy though.....
PUT A LITTLE EFFORT IN!
I have done the data sciences specialization from JHU and that was 4 star on 5.
Just a bunch of common sense statements.
The way the 4Ps are explained and applied (through barely) related to consumer products that are retailed.
There is no subtitles in English for the video lectures and the slides are in Chinese.
This is a certification course in how to teach English as a second language.
to much math
It most be more effective
It's absurdly frustrating to repeatedly fail without any feedback as to why you're failing.
The lectures are clearly from a math perspective, as the prof simply draws what he's talking about on the slides.
The topic is interesting but the exposition is so boring - the reading of a lecture outline - that I'd rather study on my own 8-(
(Kadafi regime in Libya!?
I attended many interesting courses on Coursera, but this one is simply a waste of time from the very first moment.
Not a very informative course.
Videos are dull readings of the pdfs, with many "ummmm"s and annoying lip-clicks.
The professor just read the slides (and most of the slide and content are repetitive.)
I sign up for courses because I want to learn piece by piece and get to practice each new thing.
This course was uninspiring
One way (approach) to 'teaching' data shows only that you know data but haven't designed multiple ways of teaching it.
Instructor is clearly reading off of cards or a prompter that doesn't face the camera so he's constantly not looking at you which is frustrating.
Smile on the face of professor is missing, otherwise 5 stars.
I found it to be confusing.
Just because one guy comes up to you and say that he teaches this and that do you believe them?MY ADVICE TO YOU: DON'T PAY ANYTHING FOR THIS SPECIALIZATION.
Explanation and examples were not very helpful.
Sometimes he over-explains unnecessary things.
I went through the second week, completing all assignments and quizzes, but did not learn anything new.
I thought this was poor.
They are read from the screen and you feel that attitude.
If you input correct answers they will be marked as incorrect.
The jump from the lecture material to the assignments was way too much.
Thoroughly disappointed to see this course based on
We are not PhD's, but student learners.......
I will not take capstone for this course because I suppose I would wait about a few years on grading.
These case studies are heavily weighted and if the person is reviewed negatively (for whatever reason), they must resubmit it never knowing why they were given low scores or what the correct answer should have been.
Extremely boring teacher
This is a course that sounds like a bad audiobook.
Third, the tests didn't manage to even test the material being covered.
Absolutely poor.
Omigod!
This is not for anyone actually looking to work in this field, but for someone looking to be able to talk about this field.
If homework doesn't cover too much of what people learnt in class, it is easy to forget materials in class.
Com and have a cookie cutter just add water web site.
I understand that when calling it "Introduction", it is supposed to be aimed for people totally starting from 0.
Not, it seems, this one.
edx is doing a much better job in my perspective.
The accent and rhythm of Jogesh makes it difficult to follow the course.
There is no extra information in addition to the presentation.
Although the content is correct, quality models videos and materials is very low, wanted to make all the specialization, but I'm not satisfied with the quality of the course.
There is no chance that anyone walking into the course with zero experience in AI can pass.
The material could very easily be broken down into more manageable and comprehensible chunks.
The worse course ever
I wanted to learn R because it is a free software versus paying a licencing fee to use SPSS which I have done in the past.
Waste of time if not even waste of money.
The interviews and recorded lectures were not adequate or sufficiently rehearsed.
First, the instructor assumes that the students know so much background knowledge when the students are expecting to learn these stuff in the course.
It was not helpful at all.
Not much depth.
I was looking to make a business websites.
They charge you to take a class that explains how to install a few programs.
Only shows a bit of javascript, css, and html snippets.
Previous 3 courses were great, maybe this one will improve.
A lot of people complain about the same issue during the course.
not very well organized.
Just barely cover basics of Arduino and a few shields you can use, but fails to go on to build on top of that knowledge.
]I don't think this course is for the beginners at all.
It was the worse experience I have so far on Coursera Platform; the course itself was sloppy and with nearly zero content.
I think this course is TERRIBLE and seriously needs an overhaul.
It is more like a Junit course in the beginning or as far as i could watch.
This is based on discussions with other learners in the forum who have expressed disappointment and frustration.
Because:1.
The professors seem very knowledgable but their teaching methodology leaves a lot to be desired.
Unfortunately, that's the best part of the class; the support is simply nonexistent (a post by someone associated with the staff from a previous run of the course suggests getting help troubleshooting Python from Coursera staff), the instructions for the class software are out of date, the source material for the assignments is sometimes unsuitable to the task you're asked to perform (e.
g.
The material is interesting and new, on that part the instructor is doing a good job.
What is really VERY annoying about this course is the fact that in case you have questions/problems relating anything of the course material and you (as said by the instructor) post them to the discussion forums, there is COMPLETELY NO REPLY neither from the instructor, nor from the Coursera.
There were obvious mistakes in one of the quizzes and lots of students were posting and discussing this in the forums (as this was actually preventing students from passing the course), but there was no answer whatsoever.
I find this very unprofessional, especially because of the fact that this was a paid course.
The crux of the course is based on lecture videos.
There was no way of getting clarification over the outdated assignment content.
I felt that I paid for demo of the Dato/Turi.
Puerile, made up examples with made up data, no deeper treatment of the mathematics involved than the here-is-a-magic-formula-use-it approach and mistakes (including serious conceptual and factual errors) evident in the quizzes and the R labs.
Very awkwardly worded and error-ridden tests.
Started in middle of everything, its course covers 5 to 7 factor samples, in the final exam the minimum factors is 70 or more!You not will learn R, not really business insights, but you learn some specific cases.
I think you will learn lots of betters course in this site.
I completed the course in a couple of days and felt like I learned more from free resources like Moz.
I did every step in the course until the quiz and the quiz asks for knowledge which wasn't in the course.
There were many awkward pauses between sentences that made it hard to listen to.
It really seems as though the instructor either assumes all of her students are completely inept or that because it is a free course that producing a reasonably viable product is not necessary.
I feel robbed for 49$.
I realized that it is impossible to pass this exam.
The slides are mostly just a list of bullet points, with very few intuitive figures or charts (normally figures/charts are easier to understand and remember, even the simple ones).
Covering one of each of the three core topics a week is just insufficient to provide any sort of depth to this course.
Was interesting to watch the videos, but it was a 10 minute job.
When the instructor, who is supposed to be teaching you how to write iOS apps, takes (no exaggeration) SIX minutes to even figure out how to open XCode, you know you're in for a rocky ride.
The course content is okay and covers the basics well enough.
As a Java programmer with some 18 years industry experience I quickly got lost on this course.
The lectures are often broader than what should be considered when finishing the weekly assignment.
Some things I didn't know about disabilities and colleges, however the presentation of the videos that were not of a guest speaker were poorly done.
Everyone else taking this class is confused too - how could they possibly be of any help to me?2.
Also, I hope he didn't choose the logo from his university.
Closures capture the variable itself, not the variable value
The lectures are excellent, but do not take this course if you are not already proficient in a graphing package, whether it's R, python, or something else much more sophisticated than Excel.
Many practice quiz questions and even test questions had wrong answers marked as right so you had to re-write test over and over until you guessed which one of the wrong answers was right.
And apparently I waited too long to get a refund as well.
I could not understand instructor.
just a collection of materials you'd find in any museum..
Very Boring!
People also have different standard which causes a large variation in grades.
Online help does not help.
Week 2 has a programming assignment that is way to advanced for students without any programming knowledge.
There are far too many prejudicial ideas - even in the first unit.
After reviewing the material, I had to complete the quizzes by trial-and-error since the answers were not reflected in the lectures.
The course project is truly frustrating!
This requires a high level understanding of maths (highest high school level) especially SI, and exponents.
The examples show at most 20% (that is just a guess, it is probably less) of the knowledge that I need to complete the assignments.
The course discusses diffuse and focused modes.
I expected more from Georgia Tech.
When you are late in delivery, they tell you "everything is fine, do not worry, you have until the last week of the course to complete the activity, get your note and end of the course."
This course hardly has any new content and a lot of it is also repeat from previous courses.
I hope that these feedbacks will be taken into account and the things will be changed for the next editions of this course.
To sum up, the information from this course and the manner of providing this, deserves 5 stars.
I was quite disgusted by him at the end.
Only reason I managed is that I have prior experience with the software.
cheap !!!
Also, I cannot do the homework or watch video at my own pace.
The teachers and instructors really should make better videos and stop giving peer edit assignment when people are picky and do not grade your assignment.
Filled with redundant balderdash and extremely dumbed-down and slow-paced.
I didn't learn anything more than what I already knew- which was basic concepts- and was able to pass anyway.
Much of it was "here's an introduction to a tiny detail... You go find out the rest"..
Not worth the money.
It is very basic!
and not even leaving a comment why they are giving that bad score on obvious things!
I don't feel like I am learning anymore.
The instructor just rambles on and on... there is no structure to the lectures.
Where is the discussion board?
The general dependence on SFrame is understandable since it is open source, but requiring any interaction with a licensed product (even if temporary and research licenses are available) greatly negatively impacted my experience in this course.
It must be taught by someone who can speak english clearly.
on this course but in the end I made a conscious decision to stop.
They also provided slides to revise what was mentioned in the lectures.
Coursera is changing.
It's a good metaphor for the course though, shiny but absolutely ridiculous.
and I could read the entire course worth of transcripts in under a half hour rather than go through all of the videos.
If you plan to purchase this course, enjoy, but the course isn't really free.
You can watch the lectures, but you must pay to unlock the python playground.
If you wish to be critical that's fine but at least have the courage to leave feedback for me to review.
It's just introduction(from start to end).
When I enrolled in this course I was expecting that at the end of this course I will be able to develop an app or anything like that.
This course has to change grading process because has no adequate number of students for peer review.
This course is very inconsistent when it comes to JavaScript.
As a beginner to the subject...
I for one only learn effectively when the class is engaging.
when you finish the course you won't be able to print out your certificate so don't even waste your time with this bs website.
Ummm- yes I did & it directed me to come here for help.
I feel duped.
However, I don't mean to discourage anyone from attempting this course.
The lectures go over the material very fast and you do not get much out of them, and then the assignments throw complex problems that are very difficult.
Often I feel like I missed out on content.
This alone will discourage me from purchasing a specialization in the future.
on AR feature extraction methods
In Lectures rate of speech is really fast and in some presentations are not clear
Does not deserve to be in this specialization!
I hope you will consider allowing everyone to take the quiz.
For example, if I build a regression model, how might I use it in my analytics role at work and explain the results to my stakeholders?
also the quiz nd the assignments r too tough.
hope you can make them a bit easy, the last one ,ie with graphs and trees was a bouncer.
My laptop was not sufficiently fast to run Oracle VM (I'm using Ubuntu) and there where no other instructions for how to install the Oracle dbms
When I came to the capstone project it was unavailable and for almost 3-4 months.
When we complete assignments we don't get to see the instructor's solution.
The video instructions were too fast paced.
All of which makes this course very hard to understand.
The quiz in this course is not helping this learning experience to be positive
All lecture, no use of media
If you buy the package it kind of seems like I wasted $79 dollars on a repetitive and monotone professor and course.
You could be fooled by this course if you dont know the principles of design and narrative structure, but if you know it you will not find anything of value here, becouse dont explain almost anything about videogame concepts like gameplay, balace, GAME DESIGN, etc.
Bad quality slides and presentation.
This course is best suited to perhaps a health department; not to someone seeking college level information about a topic that matters to their children's lives.
Too much technical.
Very bad course too fast is not an introduction more like a remember of things, this course try to covers too much information in 3 weeks and the assigments are not well guided and messy
I can't see how any college or university would respect any certificate from this course.
don't expect to learn anything new if you are already in IT or related field.
Didn't learn much of anything at all, the peer review system is lazy on the Teacher's part, and half of my classmates couldn't even speak proper English, let alone write it.
Some things were not tested by the teacher before being part of the course and do not actually work.
There is very little insight in this course.
The important concepts that should be explained are being skimmed over but binary terms and concepts are delved into detail.
To be honest, I thought the course stumbled and fell short.
Week one starts with interesting material that relates probability to data science.
too
The documentation was terrible.
Sorry to discover this spirit in here.
No ancillary reading material or text to help along with the assignments lead me to fail the course.
Furthermore, the procedures, that are already given, are not very well documented.
OOP paradigm isn;t explained at all.
This means that it would be impossible for me to even guess how to form an other sentence with the words i know.
I can only express my sympathy for those were seduced into actually paying for this course.
After 30 years in the IT industry, I found this course to be profoundly aggravating and a complete waste of my time - I have abandoned this course and bought a "Teach Yourself" book instead.
Content covered in this course was hard to learn, both because it was pitched at a level that realistically was more akin to a wrap up of content already covered (when in fact it was all new content) and because the instructor, Brian Caffo, has not a style that was conducive to teaching.
The instructor often would launch into a topic, and then speed through a calculation with basically no explanation.
In terms of time, this was one of the most intensive courses in the specialisation, and I'd recommend taking this course alone (not concurrently with other courses) for that very reason.
Bad one.
The BI tool "microStrategy" used in the homework is too slow and crash from time to time.
after watching so many videos like "how i got started on seo" "how to find a job as seo" "how to answer in an interview for SEO jobs" I've realized this course really needs to focus on what people wants to hear.
Where do I start?
An educated individual could easily complete this "Capstone", without any knowledge whatsoever from the previous four courses.
If you ever took acct , this will be a wasting of time.
Amazes me how academic careers are made these days.
Each instructor got worse and worse!
Important issues are overlooked or just briefly discussed in lecture.
The course was choppy
This was the most arduous undertaking I have ever been through.
However, the lectures and the quizzes do not prepare the student well for the final project.
Can't finish even week 1 if you don't pay
The instructor is not showing us the way we should think about developing programs in NodeJS, but he insists on using PowerPoint slides to show us how to code!
If you are truly new to programming you would understand nothing from the Java Script part of the course.
Change of microphone setup between intro video and "in the DAW" video is also very noticeable and distracting.
Repeats of repeats over repeats.
However, you could just watch the videos whose level is not more that elementary introduction to ML.
For sure it is not helpful!
BEWARE.
To top it off, the instructor has the nerve to show off his boat and tell us how rich he is.... Blech.
If what you're looking for is the most basic of information on making better choices and remembering to wash your cutting board after handling raw meat, maybe this course is for you.
after sentences, leaving you to wonder if there's anything left to take away from the lessons.
I'm well aware of what we covered, but if someone is stuck on a problem, there needs to be a much better way of helping that person.
Week 2 test onward requires you to modify code or program code in order to get statistics required to answer the questions.
nothing i can say that made me jump for joy.
If you know statistics, you don't need this course.
After I watched all of the videos for the first week and saw the hilarious homework I quickly checked what this is about.
LESS THAN 3 HOURS OF VIDEOS!
The course provided almost no value , and there was almost nothing covered that you couldn't find online for free.
And of course again - you have completed a course and in the end instead of finished course you will get this "sucker punch".
Good luck to everyone who wants to try to pass this course because in my opinion it means a wasted time.
-(
Then when you log back in it indicates your assignment is over due.
My philosophy is that if I want to appear in video, i better learn to cheer up.
Very disappointed in the course.
I don't understand why Coursera allowed this one to happen to be on the Coursera website.
Having worked for multiple Fortune 500's, this style would NEVER fly in the business world.
However, when I got to Course 3: Using Python to Access Web Data, I was extremely disappointed.
It is short and does not cover anything.
First R, than Basic Statistic.
There is no motivation for the formulars, no context why they are important.
Such a shame, as the subject is very exciting, and the 'lectures' in the first couple of weeks are a monotonous jabble.
But it isn't that at all.
I ended up having to take another course so I could actually complete my website.
Modern development techniques value developers and allow them to be much more active players.
Only part 3 was partly interesting and usefull.
This is a hard course to teach to begin with.
This course offered nothing significant or new to anyone who has spent any time around business or government negotiations.
I am about to request a refund.
79 dollars is not peanuts for many countries.
When they talk about climate change and the overuse of ressources they are exaggerating by a factor of 50!
This last part is super important and is what is lacking the most in the course.
I had to go online elsewhere to learn SAS before completing this course.
If you are a real beginner like me (having zero or little programming knowledge) and your time is limited, I think this course (or the specialisation) is not suitable for you.
This course was supposed to be the last one before capstone and what did we learn:· Nothing about electronic· Huge amount about networking on very basic level – question is what are people without this knowledge at all doing in IoT course· How you can tweet from Raspberry Pi (hey, is somebody crazy here)· Lot of words about camera, few minutes about servo motor and that’s all.
We have to write a web server update which is completely unexplained and no one didn’t do it because no one understood it that way (despite the fact that webserver is webserver and server is server) and during whole course no one update the task definitionThere is no discussion board, it was turned off during earlier courses and for me only explanation is that no one from UCI doesn’t care and the certificate for course cost $80-$90.
Very pathetic approach which I can only explain with 2 words: “Easy money”
Actually I feel like i'm reading the instruction manual without knowing useful skills
Please be advised that this course is not structured as a rigorous close reading, but a general invitation into some central sentiments of the Book of Zhuangzi.
It mainly felt like sitting in a lecture theatre getting a fragmented overview of the lecturer's work, while never gaining a real handle on the wider context, or what would have happened if an action hadn't been taken/had been performed differently.
If things do not work perfectly for you then you are likely never to be able to finish because your "peers" don't know any better either.
Nobody.
This is not for begginers.
If you're reading this before you enroll, don't do it, don't waste your time and money on this.
Very dissapointed and still wondering if this course is worth my attention -and extremely limited time- or not.
im in week 4 , cant master data analysis in Excel
Highly not recommended
Hello all.
No guidance, no tips, no effort whatsoever.
I went through the videos and tests for weeks 1 and 2 and found that it's just rushing us through the basics while not really telling us much.
Definitely not worth 4 weeks!A much more valuable course is Stanford's "Machine Learning" where you can actually learn something (and don't force you out of evaluation if you don't pay).
I would not recommend this course within the specialization.
That is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments (though still very challenging).
The professors also can't speak English, so instead of explaining things in depth, they have to very, very slowly read basic phrases (to explain complex subject matter) off of what's basically a teleprompter.
Suggested reading materials are needed.
I believe that instead of learning how to handle PRO TOOLS from scratch you should change the course to something more creative like recording different instruments, measuring the studio space, monitors and much more helpful things than advertise and make AVID richer.
FriendlyAll the best
I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone who's paying.
1 week into the course, very boring.
For being able to complete the course on continuous delivery the videos of the course are not a great help.
It ought to be removed.
If not, assignment instruction should be listed thoroughly as rubric, so that a beginner SEO student can pass the writing and take it as a learning experiences.
Turns out I needed to submit one additional peer review, although I only found this out by contact customer service.
Very poor lecture, I barely learn anything about excel from this course.
I was looking for a course for a basic learner, this is not.
But it seems impossible due to the fact I am interested, and I do finish every course on Business writing I run into.
But exactly installing is what the first assignment is about it is not about coding what will be only a small fraction of the whole assignment then.
And the next thing is there is not only one person facing this troubles there are quite a lot if you look in the discussion forums.
On the other hand if there would be sufficient help given for the installation it would be fine, but it is not.
The only help which is given are sending some links which is nice.
more so than experimental design or statistics.
This is hardcore since we have not learned that yet...
I didn't find this course to be too helpful.
Frankly, I could have done some interviews and research online and make a a course like this myself...
This course should be called "Intro to fundamentals of website design".
The professors sound like a group of first-year students presenting a group project, literally reading notes off of a powerpoint slide.
Needs to pay for submit assignments
I was really disappointed with this course, especially considering how great the first course was.
If it were structured in a way where (a) material was broken down into smaller bits, ideally as beta tested by true rank novices and (b) all materials or specific functions were presented with repetition, similar to how khan academy structures its math section, then this course would be much better.
The video lectures provide an introduction to quadrotor flight dynamics and path planning.
You will get/lose marks on uploading a screenshot or naming variables/functions a certain way.
I was really interested in this specialization so I kept going hoping it will get better but it only got worse.
Spending that amount of time explaining this basics it is not worth it.
The assignment focuses on matlab coding, which only emphasizes the coding technique.
The professor has a very biased view of the Islamic world, which is heavily based on his opinion and approach not on the real facts and dominant his
A good text to speech program could easily have replaced the "teachers".
This course is clearly signposted as being supported by the Templeton Foundation and it shows.
It's tragic that Coursera swallowed it as well.
All we got - links to articles which we can found ourselves without any help.
Based on 2 peers' "subjective" points of your week4 analysis assignment, even if you digested all the materials and received 100% on quizzes all weeks, you will have to repeat taking this course endlessly.
I am very disappointed in this specilization/course.
There are only 4 programming assignments, the first of which demanded a total of 2 new lines of code.
I understand its importance, but this course should be part of a UI design course, NOT in a technical CyberSecurity specialization IMO.2 - the course is all about theory, not about practical matters.
However, I have some notes.
There is no detail at all and no logical progression.
Some of the assignment simulations/animations were not working, but I was able to submit the results and get full credit.
As I hadn't done any programming for 20 years, I certainly found this difficult.
Some even duplicated their own content in the restatement.
Frustrating as hell.
There are many buzzwords but no real explanations.
I wanted to use the whole course to learn about rprogramming but I will most likely try to get back the money I spent on this and let it go.
Course material is actually decent, but extremely badly presented.
Instead, why don't you compress some valuable learning nuggets into half the course time, instead of hearing you ready through your ocean of bullet points, and needlessly underline (in red) the current bullet point your reading.
I've turned in around 10 assignments and have yet to get a grade on anything.
More repetition, clichés, and advertisement that anything else.
After going through each lesson, week by week and thinking I was really learning something, but I can't pass the first exam (even with my notes and Google) and almost had a panic attack when I looked at the second exam.
I feel like I wasted fifty dollars and hours of my life in order to get what little belief I had that I might have actually learned something come crashing down.
简直是毫无帮助。作业根本提交不了，无法通过的。It's a waste of time.
Damn near worthless.
Help and tutoring is a valuable part of education and necessary to learning!
Lecture uses "you know" so much, that I couldn't hear enything else.
Language is not good, and Lack of Info
These concepts are introduced throughout the course, but never brought together in one complete project.
Pity really.
This was only clipping through a tool, not a real capstone project.
or "...
maybe!"
the weekly quiz are premium only now?
I would love to see the whole 5 courses with David and not only the first one.
Disappoint to Coursera and Duke.
It wasn't an Excel class, rather it was a targeted business statistics class with only disjointed lectures and no benefit of textbook to actually help you learn.
Very poor quality...
The "teacher" is talking and talking without saying anything concrete or giving some tools or practical suggestions.
there are definitely some leaps made in the assumptions of what students' python capabilities are.
It depends on the context, in particular on the audience of the analysis and report.
Very basic and trivial information that can be easily summarized in an article.
Unfortunately in some courses you can´t even look into the assignments when you haven´t paid.
Lost in details.
This is strictly the Photography Gospel According to MoMA, and you either like it or lump it.
This part has to be improved a lot.
Overall I have to say that I expected much more from University of Pennsylvania, especially after taking the first part of the Specialization which was of good quality.
This is not the place for that.
In contrast, congratulations to Yuliya Voytenko, for her speech about sharing economy: it was clear, precise, focused.
Please do your best to improve your courses: you have the knowledge, let's spread it.
The course seemed not to be prepared with anticipation.
Machine learning is built on mathematics, yet this course treats mathematics as a mysterious monster to be avoided at all costs, which unfortunately left this student feeling frustrated and patronized.
If that's the case, I can't say enough good things about Biostatistical Analysis by Zar but thoroughly, logically categorizing statistical methods with short, clear examples, references to the original research, and building up one concept after another in logical order.
The only option I had was to watch videos, I could not submit quizzes, which I completed, unless I paid.
What's even the point of having this course as part of Coursera?Very disappointed.
This course is a discreditation to coursera, and it's low standards are appalling.
This course mostly about how to use plotting libraries in R.
Really poor powerpoint presentations and videos, half in chinese.
She gets some things right, but really wastes the opportunity to drill the most fundamental and important point about philanthropy: namely, that the most important factor in assessing a non-profit's value is effectiveness, and non-profits vary in their effectiveness by many orders of magnitude.
Non of the math is explained.
Really dreadful: absurdly fast progress, with really dry graphics, where they cover the history of economics in about 30 minutes!
Earlier I have also read that we would be allowed to build an app of our choice or according to teacher's specification.
1.
So maybe there is a better platform than coursera that lets you to be clear of what is ahead of you.
Didn't learn anything in this one.
The spirit of the course was destroyed by a thoughtless action.
Even if the goal were to teach those with no programming experience, it could accomplish that while providing more content, and making the content relevant.
Is the course worth the price?
).
This doesn't seem like a serious course provided by a university.
I am moving onto other courses before finishing the Usability Security.....
Not possible to complete the projects at the end.
I only did week one of the course and quit for the following reasons:Presentation of the content is too fast and provides little information among lots of noise.
bad course .. teaching was poor... assignments were very high level.. but teachings very of low profile
Some pass with less than 300 word analysis with a lot of charts and pictures.
The course material moves incongruently between legal and business negotiation tactics, which would make it difficult for any untrained future negotiator to understand the art of negotiation and ADR for business and law.
If the intention was to hold up various beliefs in the past then try to shoot them down, they partially succeeded.
It's a waste of time and money.
Very badly linked with other websites that provide the actual content.
I am on a verge of quitting it.
The continuous invitation to purchase a course where companies advertise their products is a shame and lacks in depth material.
Completely lost.
Sorry but I couldn't understand what Mercedes Paniccia spoke, which made the course even more difficult to understand.
Worse than the first course.
"customer co-creation" is presented as a ground breaking idea but it is defined so vaguely.
Wasted me tons of times.
Lectures are also difficult to follow.
The course is very short and more advanced courses are not free.
Hard to understand professor.
I think this course completely misses the point.
No chance, period!The final project grading is unfair & ridiculous.
Most folks who are going into business for themselves need good information but have little cash.
I would NOT recommend this course to anyone.
Lots of good information, but the presentation is very bad.
Instructor speaks too slow and sometimes hardly audible with my earphones plugged in with 100% sound.
Glances over the good true information about nutrition to tell us about free range farms, farmers markets, etc., which most people do not have access to or can not afford.
Giving it 1 star is being nicePeople who sponsored it should get their money back.
I am deleting it from my list.
no slides make it harder to follow.
Im definitely not going to pay for any courses in the future.
Not enough foundation given.
Also, the final peer reviewed project isn't explained very well and uses tools and methods that aren't even within the scope of the module.
Not meeting minimum quality standards.
Instead, educators came up with them on the spot.
They all explain everything horribly and jump into huge complex things with no explanation.
Also I was quite disappointed that this course pretty much only focuses on conjugate priors.
I've already written a review for part 1 and I have the same opinion about this one.
Very confusing subject which could have been better presented.
Instructors are not to be found.
I'm getting coursera verification prompts too often.
Also the " professor " 's English is terrible.
too much theory and not nearly enough practical models that I can use in my life or work.
Really excellent materials and links but spoiled by typos on the videos and in the quiz questions.
It cause all the timings of the course to be off (#1 caused the video timings to be severely off and #2 meant that the course assignment estimates were HUGELY miscalculated).
Poor content.
Not at all what I wanted to learn or find productive in the real world.
It's perfect though for my foreigner friends... as long as they understand it's real length and cost!
So many powerpoint slides..
That is why you will need to fill in the gaps using websites like betterexplained.
com or kahnacademy.
com.
The student is better served by looking at the syllabus and then going to either of those sites - where the explanations are worth your time.
In addition to failing to present steps in a logical order, the course often teaches at an extremely basic level but tests at a much, much higher level.
Could not finish the course.
Mercedes Paniccia in particular speaks in a virtually unintelligible expressionless monotone with no explanation or elaboration to relieve what amounts to little more than a list of definitions and bald statements such as can be found in the glossary section of many textbooks.
Unprecedented high speaking speed.
Reading material is listed, but they are useful for people already skilled in Bayesian Statistics.
i can not unenroll this course, it's very terrible
Why dont you open week2 and rest of the weeks ??
After how good the first course was/how much ground it covered, this course was frustrating, poorly documented, and a disappointment.
no logistic in place.
Very scattered and long lessons.
However, the assignments are structured for memorization not learning and contribute little to the experience.
Unsufficient information for the programming assignments.
I was pretty disappointed with this course.
This is a good Java Tutorial: https://www.
youtube.
com/watch?v=TBWX97e1E9g&list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19I followed two videos and I'm learning in my way.
I left the course because the ammount of time required was too high.
After the excellent first course in the specialisation, this was quite a disappointment.
I realise that the subject matter in this course will inevitably involve abstract concepts and subjective opinions, but I didn't really 'get' the way that Casey was presenting the subject given that there were quizzes and assignments to follow.
That's not to say that the videos aren't interesting.
Had to google most of the topics to understand them better.
I don't recommend paying for this, it is better to just check out the syllabus and read about this stuff online.
Note to instructor: Very simple concepts were explained using overly complicated language.
Also a lot of time the system was very picky to take an answer like correct, just because the format used, for example e!=E in one equation, and because this was necessary a lot of guessing in order to find how the system take the answer by correct.
But really the worst was the discrepancy between the video and the quiz, because my impression is that the videos were cut to fix in the time, but they were cut a lot, missing important information to be used in the quiz.
From what I gather from week 1 the course topics seems really good.
There was minimal video (compared to any other course I have done), and more detail and discussion in videos would have been more helpful.
Some of the video material is out of date already, as I suspect Bluemix layout has changed - this made navigation a bit confusing.
The downloadable Pi image has changed since the course was prepared, and the newer image has different code as standard.
Poorly written quizes and presentations.
Very hard to understand
Mostly fluff with little substance.
Also stated is that "you’ll apply your skills to create a fully-functioning photo editing app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch."
Her internet activity is rated a 2/5 whihc I did not know until I got involved with this course.
I had to spend days coding, debugging and reverse engineering the assignment files to finally be able to pass because they were wrong!
At first I thought I did not analyze thoroughly so on my second session, I basically rewrote the whole assessment, followed by samples passed students gave me, also making sure I covered all the points the instruction asked me to cover, peer gives me 1 or 1.5 point for writing persona with little detail.
What they say in some lectures is very misleading and gives either false or just insufficient understanding of certain mechanisms.
The examples are overcomplicated.
The examples that the lecture videos use do not nearly cover the variety of datasets being used by the learners in the course; and the least that could have been done is to at least inform learners of what to expect if they were dealing with a different research question and using an alternate dataset.
I know the defense may be that the videos are meant to be introductory / gateway to a deeper understanding of that particular topic.
It's such a shame because, like I said, the material presented in this course is informative and valuable information.
Lectures have very poor teaching skills.
I would rather suggest taking Data Visualization Using Tableau by Duke University.
The course caption stated that this would be where we would use Location, Design and Usability, and Persistence and Settings to build a high quality app.
If you are NOT a native English speaker, this course is designed well I think for people who do not speak English as a native language, who might even have a low level of English, yet who are teaching English already in foreign countries and would have difficulty acquiring certification any other way and therefore don't mind taking a full year to complete the course or the price and for whom not having someone give them feedback would be considered an asset.
Way too easy assignments.
This course is not organised so well concerning grading process.....
there is a lot of mistakes in the criteria of grading ....
also the material is not so good ....
I learn nothing new ...... the worst course i took in coursera Actually so no stars goes to this course
To give you an example, you will first watch a horribly made video on boolean logic, alter going to youtube to get a better explanation of 'And', 'or' , and 'not', you'll see an example done with If, else, and elif, then be asked to do homework problems using and, or, not.
The course content is way too short and basic for the price.
Plus the sequences are not even easily formatted for printing as they are all images so you can't even just copy them into an editor and break up the sequences.
This was only the second course I dropped on Cousera.
It should have been mentioned in the introduction.
It said it could be done on your schedule, but that is not true.
To the point of time there are three (!)
Offends the learner.
Do not explain very well!
I have been into a MOOC UCL and regret to say this course (Quantitative Foundations for International Business) is a big disappointment.
Material is really interesting and helpful, but a lot of bugs in video productions.
The whole course based on some proprietary software.
Too theoretical.
Also, a lot of the mathematical notation was written in a kind of psuedo Python code that made things confusing sometimes.
All this peer grading nonsense is garbage.
I didn't find the overall content of the course very well chosen for an introduction to philosophy - since it covers so little.
I am disappointed, from a place like Stanford I was expecting a real course in nutrition.
This course doesn't teach anything.
I can only recommend this specialization/course IF the instructors add a project at the end , be more involved on the forums , update non functional links ,and finally USE NON PROPRIETARY libraries hence they will need to take feedback from the students and redo most components of this specialization.
And there seems to be no way to un-enroll.
For example, week 2 includes a few Skype videos of the professor interviewing former students from a Duke Master’s program.
I should have asked for my refund within the first week, but I felt since I was paying, I would stick it out a little longer.
What am I supposed to do with the answer?
mind-numbingly boring
"The Question: "What part of your brain is being activated?
Very basic and boring
Sadly, his presentation was only 25% of the course.
I'm sorry.
However, the course certificate is meaningless.
the video is too long
Without certificate I cannot prove I took the course.
The explanations in this course are very unclear and tricky, even some of them are omitted, which makes this course very hard to understand.
This course seriously lacks of logic.
It's a second edition of this course.
Very disappointed at the lack of notes and course material.
Questions asked on the forums about it got no answers before the end of the course.
If you really like to know a great course that relates to the topic, I strongly advise you to check out the course "Public Speaking" by Dr. Matt McGarrity here at coursera.
The makers of this course, and especially the instructor, obviously have had very little to no experience of any kind with most of the topics they discuss.
Those who have all sorts of experience and write things that are way advanced for a "Beginners" course.
Do yourself a favor, and seriously do some research on appropriate programs before signing up for this one.
greed rules.... previously the course was free including the quizzes to check whether one learned something or not; now you have to pay 60$ just to check your learning progress (I do not need a certificate, just learning for myself)
Instructor speaks in a monotone with no emotion.
Hard and dry
I recommend Level up!
There is not enough coverage of fundamental programming concepts, and too much playing around with complex application concepts such as Steganography.
The content was not related to big portion of the assignment.
One week I spent literally 30+ hours writing and debugging codes for just one quiz.
I guess if you have no education or experience its good.
The instructors spent too much time telling you what you will learn and talking too slowly as if wanting to fill in the gaps than actually having some worthy material prepared for all the "pupils" out there, who gave their time, effort, and commitment.
Having completed over 10 Coursera courses over the year, and numerous other online classes, this is officially the worst.
I agree!
Make changes and make them now.
Another reason I hate this course Is that Coursera does not believe in people helping one another.
Too short to get any depth of information.
I had hoped for something at a more advanced university level.
The course are fantastic but 3 month HARD WORKING to earn a "cheap" certificate that looks false :( I cannot present it to my company
This is the issue of the Coursera( included other MOOCs) Open Access Education philosophy.
Timelines at the end sometimes help, but are shown too late.- The forum is abandoned!
Outdated material, nightmare to submit assignments.
The lectures are very well-organized.
Hi!just a terrible course, honestly.
I tried giving zero stars.
only theory no practice.
100% of the time, there is at least 1 question with the wrong answer.
The next classes in the specialization get even worse, with the student forums full of students who can't get any help though the grueling process of installing Oracle, Pentaho, etc.
I do not want to rate this course at this stage but I would like to make the following comment in relation to the course resources and in particular the answers to the exercises in the optional text book.
For students who do not have a copy of the text book, providing answers to questions from the text book without showing the actual questions is not very useful and to be quite frank, ridiculous.
The course material has significant gaps of information.
I do not intend this to be mean, but I could not listen to Richard Waterman.
The pedagogy in this course is truly horrible.
I'd avoid this course if possible, but it's required for the specialization.
If you are considering this specialization I would recommend the Andrew Ng course instead and the main reason is that it isn't depend on proprietary ML framework.
This course doesn't worth it, it's just to take extra money from anyone who wants to learn about Data Science.
It feels like a draft that no one cared to take a second look.
Well, while I felt really frustrated after having played ALL of this course videos, I have first put very negative comments here for its reviewing.
disappointing.
I really want to refund my money!
Some sections only have one slide and it takes longer to access the slide than it does to read it.
This course is poorly designed.
It was difficult for me as a new learner in the text analytics field to follow such dense theoretical concepts.
I found the lectures really boring, too long, hard to understand and just not really motivated well.
The assignment itself is just opening and saving file in Tableau.2) in weeks 4 peer graded assignment you just asked to write some vaguely defined 1 page description.
This course only works if u pay, which is shit coz most people dont have money...
This course was a big let-down compared to other courses in the specialization.
Also I have already paid for the certificate.. com
It is not as impactful as I thought it would be.
I am very disappointed about the content.
How do I predict an outcome with a Tree or Neural Network?
Audio quiz had no sound (struck-thru speaker icon I couldn't fix.
Altogether, this makes doing the programming assignments very unsatisfying.
Finally, the professor presenting the materials does not take part in the discussion forums.
It's very sad to hear that this course gets recommended a lot, but it missed it's mark completely.
And why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos, and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments?I am a member of your site for many years and I have also recommended your site in many people.
Not very good nor scientific
so I personally think this course is on of the worst classes among the Coursera.
This course must be a part of another courseres.
However, the peer graded evaluations are subjective and take too long to get feedback and progress in coursework.
Last exercise is half the course and took many frustrating hours to install and for me never worked.
Too theorical and bold course
I got a headache and lost my motivation to learn the subject!
It's very boring course.
Examples are useless, explanations are often vague or even incomplete.
No stars for this course, 3 modules I did, and I think is not a valuable course, gives a bad introduction to the language, there are inconsistencies in the theory and knowledge of the language.
But if you are critical and question things they teach you they will ignore you.
teacher talks much too slowly, and uses many complex terms when they are not needed
Nothing good in this course
I found it very easy.
The content is mostly theory from the e-textbook.
Plus the staff rarely response!In short, I hope the staff of the course would see this.
I was denied completion of this course because a fellow course taker felt the need to "grade" unfairly.
Mine's course "Data Analysis and Statistical Inference" and was quite impressed by it.
The audio is horrible... use a mic.
You are eagerly anticipating the returns after the first month.
not a good course
Here is why: First, the level, at which the course material is presented, is very low.
The course is short in terms of length and weak in the terms of developing ideas.
The new platform Sucks!!
The assignment is also way beyond the level of an introductory course.
Few explanations, no feedback after doing things wrong.
No original material, they use Tableau training material.
You must write the entire assignment before you can see if the first line of code you wrote works.
The course instruction is at 10000 feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will NOT teach you the skills required to complete the assignments.
Just a huge waste of time...
The videos were very tedious and convoluted, in addition to being outdated.
He leaves that totally to other students like yourself, to grade your written assignments, and, they do not read and give you a RANDOM grade in 2 seconds.
Don't take it, you will waste sooo much time on this one.
A list of research papers to read further that's it.
Some exercises need some improvement.
If you wont to know how if, for, functions works, what is variable etc, then this is the right place where to learn this basics.
It's a 2 week course that's not particularly difficult or creative with the assessments.
They're too summarized -- too quick-- and they lack the thoroughness required to accurately convey the intuition the student needs to comprehend the lessons taught.
You do not learn anything that helpful, and perhaps the actual Swift documentation is way more clearer than this course is.
In my opinion you are damaging an important discussion if you are lying and exaggerating in such a shameless way.
:(
Then why in the end you require to complete a task which is fully philosophical?
This is not a coding specialization and if I wanted to learn coding I would have taken a coding course!
Apple Annie was difficult
Let's admit it - today's security software is not for the uninformed/experienced.
The last set of lectures is also just badly executed, a confusing meandering talk that amounts to nothing.
The few tidbits of information that they did give about using wordpress were so brief with no examples.
Quite frankly, I have spent well over 10 hours at this point on a single problem and I've created my own tests and I have looked at all the very vague hints given in the forums and I still have no clue what to do.
Video content barely summarizes the outline of each module.
So, if you're interested in learning some Math, this is a great course for you.
In my opinion this is not a course.
I finished the course in around 3 weeks, so medical students wouldn't get so much benefit out of the course.
The initial lecture started with an entirely uncontextualised location-visit to Lewes, and mention of the Battle of Lewes in the Barons' War, with plenty of merry jumping over the *rather more important* Magna Carta.
But if you're a beginner to HTML, CSS, and Java Script, this isn't for you.
It should be zero because it wasted my time.
No content, essentially you just read a textbook.
need to pay to submit quiz.
Assignments not always in line with lecture.
Material is above beginner level.
The Professor is very slow and boring.
the presentations are really boring!
I have to say goodbye Rice now.
ps: worse part is i really enjoyed the last time i was here.
The same information was covered in multiple lessons.
If you are not a Math student, don't take this class.
A petty tyrant does not make a good teacher.
Should I ever meet anyone interested in studying Philosophy, my first recommendation to them will be stay away from the University of Edinburgh, since there is no respect for debate, freedom of expression, or inquiry there.
The lecturer's manner is anno
Very little content on offer other than some short clips and mildly interesting readings.
Waste of money.
As a learner its confusing to know what to take out of each video.
The extend to which students are used to promote the course by prompting them to tweet about the videos is a concern.
In every single video, they're all missing.
No real-life examples, no practice, just obvious things and pure theory from dawn of dinosaurs.
thats it.
Just call it "Start Writing" and put it on a blog.
Also, even though the videos are really well-done, they are short and contain little information for the price.
Worst course I have ever taken in my life.
Thanks for creating short course for busy business pearson.
But, it is too gamificate to (professional business managers) educate.
Your classmates with experience in adobe are scoring you based upon the instructors "excellent" examples.
The videos are painfully slow (am I waiting for a doodle here???)
Mistakes in quizzes and exams, frequent misspellings, low effort.
You are NOT going to get support if you dont understand something.
I got bad mark and I don't know why.
I have only one good comment.
This class assumes a lot of statistical knowledge and background that is not covered in the first three classes of the series.
This course is a prime example of academiaitis - ideas created in ivory towers without any practical input or use.
I recommend the lecturer to improve the previous weeks and to redistribute some of the contents of week four.
I suggest you give it a try and see for yourself.
History has proven many of Professor Shelton's conclusions to be wrong.
The professor really doesn't put in the effort like other professors on Coursera.
The course Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots (edX) is much better.
The second week is devoted to the discussion of the importance of literature review.
But links I can also watch by myself.
So I really liked this course and found it interesting ( or I still find it interesting ), but I don't see what learn effect I should have from messing around with those deal.
II libraries.
It is poorly assembled, offers hardly comprehensible material with no or very few resources to turn to.
Very elementary coursework.
Hi,I was looking for a good introduction course to food and nutrition and, alas, this is not it.
I knew 90% of the things discussed in this course, and I was expecting more, but all I got was very basic advices ("eat less", "don't eat crap", etc.
discussing) diplomacy, but the practical effect is at best busy work with little new knowledge or insights gained.
to get things to work.
I lost many hours trying to debug and rework assignment code, just to get it to work for the grader tool.
Seriously, this is one the poorest quality lectures I've ever done!The quality of peer assignments to grade are a joke.
This is a good topic but the course are poorly designed with very limited support!I mean if you are truly love the topic , you should pass on the passion to your students and design the course that students not only learn the material in the course but also can know how to ask questions and find out the questions themselves ,but first like learning any skills students needs to ask lots of questions !
if you do not have a background in statistics do not expect to pass this course
When I was taking this course, my city is going through severe flooding and the country is in yellow alert stage due to abnormal thunder storms.
i was very excited at the beginning of the coursebut when i figure out that i must paid for unlock some important lecturei really felt disappointed i thought i should only paid if i want to took the Certificatei had been wasted some time at this coursenow i have to search for another course but complete one this time.
Worst course I took on Coursera so far!
the wieos are not targeting online students.
Help via the discussion forum was critical to design an analysis pipeline - so thank you Dejan and all contributors for the support.
This is not a course I could easily do part-time: I don’t have time to read the fine print on what is available for free on Amazon, nor do I have time to go through all of the tools on galaxy to find out what would be the best for my analysis.
On the positive side: I think Galaxy is a great tool.
Was expecting soo much more from the entire courses.
However, it is very basic and coursera might not the right platform.
There is hardly anyone who responds to the feedback that is sought for!
The course appears unfinished and very disorganized.
It was almost all done in downloadable PDF's that were rarely discussed in the lectures.
Because of these limitations, most of my work was done on my own, and by purchasing the related book.
I had to Google my way through this entire course.
I've taken 4-5 courses on Coursera before and always found the quality top notch.
Not what I expected
Won't let us complete quizzes without paying!
Incorrect formulas.
Clearly filler material for the specialization.
All in all, a very frustrating experience.
The material and videos are so poor, and low quality, I am happy to not have bought this course
The lectures were mostly stuff I learned at school and really quite easy, but I just have no idea what the final project has got to do with the lectures.
I dislike the way the grade is settled.
(The quiz questions tend to focus on course-content minutiae -- "Which commentator said X about Y?"
This course didn't talk too much about data management and visualization, which made me feel quite disappointed.
I don't know how useful the ambiguous requirements exercise is when we only have one-way feedback.
It's hard to follow the lecture without proper diagrams or examples.
This is not a course - each session is 4 mins or less...
There is no engagement in the course forums.
The course did have a few bright points, like the second series of lectures explaining varieties of naturalism, but overall the course was just bad.
The main goal of the course is for you to use Stack Overflow.....
SAVE YOURSELF $
If you have any technical skills this entire course is extremely tedious.
Programming assignments come with no explanation.
This course needs much more work from instructors before it gets offered to the public.
I could write a wrapper for Int in Java in 2 minutes.
The reason why I am giving only one star that the course did not covered much information and the time allotted could have been less than 4 weeks.
When is the first time it makes noise?
It's not on architecture for IoT as name suggests.
would request more emphasis be put on presentation skills as the course material seems ok for a refresher
While Chris Impey is knowledgeable and good, the course structure is very poor and leaves a lot to be desired.
Though, I enjoyed the other courses in this series and think they were great, but I am afraid this one was a real disappointment.
No exercise for practice.
Only one star as it was not made clear you could also get 1/5 points in assignments noted as ties but no further explanation.
This was very disappointing, especially considering it's a Wharton product.
too many grading errors.
I'm struggling to motivate myself into the second course.
Material for the course is outdated.
It is a poor course because is not properly designed for internationals.
As it currently stands it is a collection of poorly integrated slides and concepts that serve to confuse the student more than educate.
The few examples that are given lack adequate explanations of the code they contain.
This course was very disappointing and much of the content in the tests and course did not show up in the course project.
Very Poor Course.
Should be removed from Coursera.
Now, as is, it would be truly foolish to take this course.
The class format -- only quizzes during most weeks, no programming work, then ending with a *huge* programming assignment -- is really poor pedagogical technique.
I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this.
Khan Academy is a great place to start, and Udacity has a great class that gives a good intuitive understanding.
The information was interesting but sort of long.
It seems like, the professor does not know enough about the subject to speak freely and engaging about the topics.
I strongly believe that if a person can understand those videos, I'm pretty sure that he knows that 5-years-old-extremly-basic-stuff).
As much I like this concept of coursera, "speak english professionally" or even "speak english" is really a big statement for that course.
With no access to assignments, how could one evaluating his efficient of study?
Is this a real course for a data scientist just installing shit and a peer reviewing for that screenshot and forking all repos ...
very bad not worth to be with rest course in specialization
We had to contact Coursera several times for weeks to get a simple yet not helpful reply from ESSEC.
I think this course is great, I like everything about it, but I can't say the same about the quiz format, it is rigid and non-standardI gave up on the course many times because of thisHow do write Sqrt(5) for instance ?
Tutor is not explaning, he only reads; he reads sort of teleprompter and that's it.
The monotonous drone of the instructors combined with the super low volume that one has to strain to hear, the extra extra long essays which read like one long chapter less novel, the videos which extend what could've been covered in 5-7 minutes to nearly 30, all take the interest away.
The assignments are exceptionally challenging given that the instructors offer now actual instruction on how to perform them.
Too much emphasis on taking tests versus actually programming.
Tableau has great free resources too that are better than what I paid $80 for on Coursera.
It was extremely messy, jumping around from definition to definition with little to no explanation and there was a general lack of motivation from professor Egger's part.
Apart from week 1 that had some necessary basic knowledge of Excel, all of the next weeks' lessons were fast paced beyond a beginner's comprehension.
I haven't learn anything from this course.
Coursera have a lot to answer for, and this specialisation is not even worth wasting your time if it was free.
Taught without purpose; meaningless instructions given to copy without regard of the bigger picture.
Too basic for programers
Given the length of the course, it feels like you already need to know the material before even taking it.
My course ended on May 15, but they have not let me present my last activity, May 3 even before the final exam.
SO dry and monotonic.
Only able to audit the class, no longer able to take quizzes and tests.
Course was very basic also.
)Further, the lack of response to questions posted in the forum indicates a lack of engagement from instructors and / or facilitators.
I am getting bored and very disappointed because it is a very important topics these days.
This course suffers grossly from the "curse of knowledge".
starting to like this
Secondly the owner of this course should have allowed at the assignment to be submitted, because some people purchase a course only right after they have completed it.
This is pretty strong evidence that there was no lesson planning involved.
they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined.
Unfair assignments ((
This course has no practical example.
Excel sheets do not match what is demonstrated in video lectures, lots of confusion around how to complete tasks, quiz answer options not being correct, and missing Excel spreadsheets (e.
g.
Completed three weeks, all assignments exactly as instructed.
There are other great courses on Coursera.
Nevertheless, this course might be of interest for some students.
Do NOT recommend.
Reading is not Teaching.
I cannot take the quizzes, because of money.
Sign up for the free version and go watch the videos.
It needs to be structured way better than what it is now.
I gave it a star because one was the minimum.
The quality of videos is not good.
If you do pay, you may feel very cheated at the end.
I hope they will improve it because the subject is interesting.
I could not install all the software needed to complete the course nor do I understand what they are used for... too bad.
I screamed for help many times but no one replied to my request.
These repeats make the lessons unnecessary long, it feels I could have been told the same information in half of time or less.
This combines with very slow pace of a lector.
The material is very randomized, and the instructor presents it in an overly complex way.
I've used Excel for over 15 years, daily, and to have the gall to say your course will 'master' something with a few videos is misleading and deceptive.
If it wasn't for the TA/Mentors who do the lions share of work in the forums answering questions and deciphering the questions so students can understand them this course would be an abysmal failure.
If you're wanting to jump on the data analysis/ scientist bandwagon look elsewhere.
The lectures did not seem appropriate for the people without proper background.
Had to dig through several buried links to make any progress on the homework assignments.
Too short, too easy, too costly.
Some videos were very well explained while others I didn't understand at all.
a little boring.
I'm completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience.
Course lacks wider and real socio-political context of the XIX and XX century Central and Eastern Europe.
Quizzes don't match what's been taught in the video lectures.
Lacks clarity to the point of bringing the providers expertise in to question (only those who understand a concept and have relevant experience have a hope of explaining it) .
There is no clear guideline, format, or even sample provided, but the grades are left to the peers.
Quizzes were too simple while I expected some challenging questions that'll make you think.
?While the instructor is knowledgeable, this course is geared toward someone with NO knowledge, not someone who wants to gain a deeper understanding.
It would be interesting to find out if any of the rave reviews came from real beginners.
Most of the problems have already been noted by other reviews, so I will only mention a few that I did not see mentioned.
The course requirements should include hardware and software essentials.
A disappointment.
Everything sounds like bits and pieces from magazine articles....
Event that the access to the video was not restricted (thus, many knowledge can still be acquired by those who want), the assignments have their important role in the learning process.
I saw that I am not the only one who mentioned in the feedbacks the purchasing problem for this course.
Hate this class, I wasted 200 bucks on this crap and now I am stuck taking it...
It's not a good course and I think it's not worth to purchase these classes.
Nothing about this subject matter is easily digestible for a designer, and I'm okay with that.
After drumming how important to actually "code", he proceeded to present the whole lecture showing small pieces of codes.... on slides.
It barely contains any facts, and it contains in total zero references to studies that facts are taken from.
Compared to the other Coursera course I attended ,this one is by far the least useful one.
There were no instructors answering the many questions raised by the students.
A learner should not be tricked into paying $39 for an 1.5 hour reading of powerpoint slides.
I have watched a few video lectures of the other courses in this specialization, and the presentation of material reflects problems aforementioned.
Please considerably improve this course or remove this specialization from course catalog.
I wouldn't pay $49.00 Dlls.
I needed an overview of the main components of Neuro Medical Science.
It's like a running commentary on a movie instead of an educational presentation.
Needs to include more hands on development.
The quizzes really do not complement the material taught.
I don't like that the course then makes me feel that I must rely on a specific product to solve problems.
Poor visual aids, course content and format.
I would like to think that the course designers would take some sort of appropriate action to remedy this.
How exactly this would be done is up to the course designers but I would suggest that another downloadable PDF document showing all the questions would be extremely useful and necessary.
I look forward to a response.
Regards, Trevor Farley
Videos are poorly edited (too much blank space, the bullet points are not clearly visible, there is no narrative or discursive structure, the diagrams are not clear, and the interviews are raw and unedited).
There was no effort made to provide a method to get through the course given all the changes since the videos were recorded.
The jump to javascript is too great for beginners.
Despite having completed quite a number of coursera courses before, and even being already familiar with a good deal of the preliminary material in this one, i soon abandoned it due to the inadequate and scrappily prepared presentation of material.
The main professor were reading the scripts on the monitor.
Did you notice those 4 or 5 star ratings with no written reviews?
Without a doubt the worst course I have ever taken anywhere.
Shame on you University of Houston SystemI did the first three lessons, which are less than average, then went on to quiz 1, after completion, a window appeared to ask me for money to get my results!
The quizzes were vague and either didn't have clear correct answers or didn't feel applicable to the module to which it was assigned.
(Many versions of Windows can't do this) Discovered/resolved over many hours, when course content would not work.
The actual course content was sparse/not much to it other than "Bootstrap bootstrap bootstrap."
This moderator made no attempt to enter into constructive discussion, but told me that 'you cannot say our professor is wrong because you disagree with him' and that I should 'read the sentence properly': in other words, no criticism, however constructive, can be tolerated.
The transition from the original Coursera platform to the new one has significantly reduced my overall satisfaction with the course experience (I have previously taken the 4 earlier Rice courses in this series and enjoyed them immensely).
Major contributing factors to my dissatisfaction:-- The user interface changes are unwelcome and have detracted from my ability to engage with the material.-- There have been arbitrary (and unannounced) changes to polices, e.
g.
There is a lot of confusion around what the instructor wants to say.
In some cases, way too much detail; in others, not nearly enough.
The subtitles have so many errors that they are virtually useless.
dropping distinction grading.-- The price increase per course and locking down of assignments to only those who have paid has unfortunate side effects, including.-- In contrast to previous courses in this series which had an active community engagement the discussion forums are now relatively empty, running the courses more often is not going to help this situation.
Having previously been an unpaid evangelist for the Coursera approach and materials I now find myself extremely reluctant to recommend this revised experience to colleagues.
I just wanted to learn and to test the acquired knowledge.
I realize that it is impossible to improve this project without any money, but you can obtain the needed money from other sources (donations, sponsorships) without affecting those who want to learn.
Week 4's material is not really helpful and I had a feeling that the instructior just wanted to "wrap up" the course and didn't really care if the material is appropriate.
Terribly taught, no support, problems only vaguely related to the course material, and designed to force you to buy the manual for the course.
The student is presented with a number of time consuming/wasting formulas to apply to the decision process.
If one ACTUALLY used those formulas, one would still be waiting to buy the first stock.
A question from the Week 4 test will demonstrate just how useless this course is:The Situation: "You invested to maximize your wealth over a one year period.
I have done the course but I didn't get my certificate yet for reasons that I don,t know.
He doesn't have any critical view of his field (which is unfortunately full of crappy studies).
It is peer graded which is extremely unreasonable, people do not read the submissions fully or fully have the knowledge to be able to grade someone else's work.
Disappointed ... very technical course and not so practical for today's world, there is a lot of terms and subjects that you require a good background in statistics analysis to understand well.
Just someone reading off slides.
It's entirely possible that you could be stranded with no one to grade your work - Coursera's suggestion if this should occur is that you should beg on the forums - or transfer your work to a later session of the same course.
The course syllabus seems very good but the actual lectures are not good.
They try to explain, complex topics in 3 minutes ...
Assignments do not match up well with the lessons and the lessons are BAD.
Several old mans read subtitles from obsolete books under the camera.
This course is quite outdated.
The artistic level, the videos, slides, etc were something a high school student could pull together.
This course's content is useful but honestly the final project is ridiculous because it is peer reviewed and the project is not very straightforward.
And there is no any interaction on the slides, or explaining on the graphs and meaning of sentence.
I was unable to watch any of the lecture videos due to the page reloading every 2 - 10 seconds.
The assignments require you to produce design documents that are tedious, going on impossible, to write without some firm rooted idea to start from.
Maybe if you really want to be a game designer then this will be the course for you.
Week 2 was really good.
It was very disappointing.
They didn't explain the difference between wordpress.
com and wordpress.
org even though they mentioned them both.
Maybe if you aren't new to R and have a programming background, it may not be so bad, but if you are new to R and not an experienced programmer, this is not the class to take to learn it.
Provided nothing of value or relevance to the previous courses.
Unfortunately I think the level for this course is very low and not worth paying for, it has a very local perspective of logistics (not involving international logistics but only US operations), there's no communication with the professor or assistants, so it's basically watching a few very short videos explaining general concepts that apply only to certain types of operations.
The assignments are very vague, with no requirements or restrictions provided, basically anyone can write anything and as long as you follow the requested format it will be graded ok; grading is not based content and therefore there's no way to know whether you're learning and applying the concepts properly or not.
Wouldn't recommend paying for it.
Explain what the various areas are, what they are needed for, and how to control them.

The course started a month late, when it finally started it was boring.
I'm 19, I'm not in school because I don't want to waste thousands of dollars on stuff that's elementary so I don't think I could get any special benefits and get courses for free, but that's also the reason why I'm on here, but I'm disappointed to have wasted 50 dollars if they aren't going to refund me.
The grader is merciless.
(The functions probably are in a minified file, but the students were not given access to that file.)
A lot of opinion based on scant evidence.
Coursera should not allow there to be courses that evoke such frustration and emotion.
I wish Coursera would really stop professors from pushing their responsibility- grading the work of the students and offering THEIR feedback- onto the students who may or may not have a firm grasp of the material in question.
I found the course to be boring.
I understand it is a technical subject but going slide after slide reading the material without any clear explanation, is not learning is just reciting.
It would have been better to try and put only half of the facts (we can always search for specific flag) and explain more about use cases.
There has to be a better way to pass the materials.
There is only dryness and ethical superior pride through his theory.. Altruism without love is an empty vanity and well-designed commercial intention for selling his theory.
This is easily the worst course in the Statistics with R specialization.
Despite all the bad reviews this course got I told myself to give it a try to refresh my antic prior knowledge and since it is for my personal usage and not a career I m not interested in a certificate.
concepts on prospect theory is not explained correctly
Better to read a book or two than waste your time on this course; the videos are extremely short, shallow and a waste of time!
Lecturer has many pauses, that even on increased playback speed (x1.25), are still distracting.
I was looking for something that was more so at a college level.
The course contents are unfortunately very poorly designed, and this has been an ongoing trend in this overall specialization.
The weekly lecture videos are at times quite unclear and leave more questions unanswered than they answer.
This isn't anything new.
Mentors were unhelpful and generally unresponsive during the course, course content was broken and/or missing, and the level of background in both calculus/probability needed to truly understand the material in this course was not obvious at all from the beginning.
Reason, lecturers are terrible.
I was planning to enroll many specializations but now I am not going to do it.
The assignments were lacking in case studies and were very textbooky.
The professor did not Interact with people, I was wiling to see some discussions and contributions among people
That isn't teaching (online or otherwise).
The instructor is super brief and his slides are mostly made of a list of acronyms!I would not recommend it until they make some serious changes to the content and presentation of material.
very poor.
Try learning Regression Models elsewhere.
Nothing inherently wrong with that but when your course title has the word 'EXCEL' in it one would reasonably expect the instructor to actually demonstrate using excel.
They say all you need to have is very basic computer knowledge (sending emails, opening a browser), but the lectures are taught using acronyms and terms that are not at the beginner level.
The slides are unclear and very very ugly and old style.
The assignment is very specific to Linux based machine.
Only one programming assignment.
More theory than practices.
The QCMs don't really help understand.
After touting how cool and useful Sublime is as a developer tool, he didn't even use it.
The course is misleading - the difficulty ramps up too quickly, with the result that those who do not have a programming background will not be able to keep up.
I am really sorry that a course with such a good content is ruined by the unrealistic assignement of week 4.
The concepts are not explained well.
The lecturer was an annoying speaker and very repetitive.
Week three quiz is real bad.
After 4 weeks of course, not a single reply from any of them in the forums.
To make matters worse, the material is very superficial and lacking, the biggest proof of that is that each module is composed of about 4 videos of 5 minutes each!
There is no repetition of any exercise or function to engrain any of the material.
Listening to a math lecture without doing challenging problems or deriving mathematical results to build intuition can be a waste of time.
"Many poor design choices for the presentation.
10/10 would program again
Very poorly explained.
And ever since then whenever the capstone is available my schedule has been very busy.
you must use the exact format to get the correct answer on problems, or it will be marked wrongthe course is "as is" meaning when there are mistakes in the coursework neither web hosting nor faculty have are available to correct mistakesmoderators are not allowed to correct course content, so what they end up doing is editing your post in the forum.
I have taken some introductory courses in swift programming and were much more elaborating than this; for instance, the part "i think" in week 4 were Jack Wu explains closures, functions, enums, structs... in less than 10min, i studied that in around 5 hours atleast in other visual tutorials online.
Another approach but mathematical demonstration is probably possible.
Coursera offer technologies to avoid classroom demos on whiteboard.
Probably the problem is that it really is super basic and may be useful for somebody who is doing 1-2 year of Bachelor's.
No more.
Overwhelmed with so many terms without clear explanations.
As a beginner I found this course was not structured and I was confused about the correct steps to take in order to start programming in Swift.
Excel is an afterthought for this course; instead there is a heavy focus on statistics.
Take a good introductory course in Java before diving into the vastly more complex world of the Android environment.
Advertised as an easy course, week 1 is simple but quickly becomes far too difficult by week 2... Too late for your refund.
No clear explain about which is the right dataset to be downloaded, no support from instructors about that on discussion forum.
It is purely reading off the slides in any case, word for word.
Very poorly-designed questions, where there is more than one correct answer.
And I'm still wondering why simpke brainstorming is called ZiZoZi ("new" approach as it described).
Patronising and very poor in content.
Given that one essentially spends an extra work day each week on the course, I expected more value for my precious time.
I complete week 2 and now i come back to watch videos about week 3 and i see that i dont do anything.
Can you imagine ?Good job guyz.
Things appear on the quiz that aren't in the home work or lecture.
No translations available despite what subtitles and transcripts say.
Wide recognition of the importance of this may be more recent than the studies covered in the course.
I want to bring it to Coursera's attention that this specialization on Conflict Management is poor quality, poor value and hardly any content.
Very basic, and only scratching the surface of a much larger topic.
The scoring is "not good", "good", "excellent".
I would not recommend this specialization to anyone.
Sometimes things are explained as if the listeners have no programming background at all.
What was not apparent to me though is that you have to take 2 parts of the specialization before getting certified and it will take over a year!
This class was really lacking.
Presentation is unstructured.
Seems to be a student project where his professor "helps" along to check certain topics the student has to include to get a good grade.
The course strengthens my positive opinions of Feynman's view of the philosophy of science.
In general.
They teach you the basic stuff but they expect you to accomplish intermediate quizzes.3.)
Useful as a necessary step towards finishing the specialization only.
I was hoping that the Nobel prize winner would teach something that complicated in the simple way.
and how best to make a basic bowl of oatmeal into a complete breakfast, that would have been a useful topic.
I'm just hugely disappointed.
How often would game noises be made?
The project did not allow itself to apply many of the concepts learned throughout the course.
Why am I learning so much about a dog or who is whose relative in a bioelectricity course?
A missed opportunity.
They always forget the second part of it: it is just valide in a closed system.
Abstract when the assignment is related to psychology.
I tested different computers, windows and mac operating systems, different browsers, different security settings, etc.
This course did not make any effort until I had to dig deep into biology by myself.
The lectures are unpolished and hard to follow, especially as the captions are inaccurate.
Not so great, I think.
I had great expectations, but the course focuses on really basic stuff.
Very disappointed in this offering.
A good idea, but not very well presented.
Next is an intro to bootstrap.
Please do not use Coursera for advertising your friends´companies, or at least learn how to do it a little more professionally to look really relevant!
all video lectures feel like they are just read from a paper and it takes a lot of effort to follow and engage.
I have been programming professionally since 1989.
so not really a MOOC.
This course starts very simply with data clean up (almost too simply!
The course is very difficult to comprehend..
Moreover the examplanations given ar not concise and brief..
I'm in week 3 and EVERY video has been just as difficult to follow.
Quizzes are hard to understand and ask you about things that weren't of any actual value to the course, and/or weren't even covered.
too slow
The URLs for the course's required readings are presented as non-clickable text in the course lecture videos.
However, assignments are incredibly difficult.
I truly regret investing my money on this course.
They give you all this code that has already been written without actually tell you how do to that yourself or what a vast majority of it does and you have to fill in code in a couple places to make it work.
Contrary to what is being billed here, all the concepts here are from the more traditional school of marketing.
The first week's material has no substance whatsoever (literally!).
Also, not made for people to actually learn how to program in R. It is sad that I paid for this, and ended up going to another resource to learn... and it was much much easier.
This is despite the fact that the course equates "35 PDU's" and "counts towards the UCI Project Management Certificate Programm"; as it was described in the FAQ.
Professor Daniel Egger and his assistan MUST improve the lessons, including examples step by step specially for the multiple linear regression su
And the course says it's for educators but it doesn't go into much detail on how to actually teach the information.
She does not appear in the video lectures.
This course is a complete scam.
Overall the videos related to the quizzes are to vague and un detailed, I more often than not feel lost.
Also this should not be part of the interaction design specialisation, and just be a small part of another course.
Not once have I needed R or statistic in my 7 year design career.
I feel betrayed.
So having to re-course or leaving without convincing reason
This will absolutely waste hours of your time and way too much of your money for what they are providing.
It's more like introduction to introduction DIY Swift.
https://desktop.
github.
com/ So much easier to use.
The material in the lectures is straightforward enough, and the swirl exercises are easy to get through and informative, but the assignments are, without exception, based on writing functions in R with basically zero experience.
I am very disapointed about this course.
This course would be much better if there was some actual substantive content.
Too many videos and not cluttered assignment codes
Although the content is interesting, I would have liked it better had the content and the instructor been a little more engaging.
Not well presented at all.
not much creative modules.
Frequent and forced peer reviews with no opportunity to complete once deadline is missed makes this course nu-necessarily difficult for people with conflicting schedules and responsibilities.
i asked to have my grade adjusted, but they deleted that post also
In my opinion, most of this information should be free and available as a pre-req.
When it comes down to it, there's simply not the support to assist a student that has a really hard problem, "hacker mentality" seems to equate to "figure it out on your own cuz nobody's going to help you".
Staff are incredibly arrogant bordering on aggressive.
Very hard for a beginner.
Bad course.
The major problem is that this course has no clear objective.
Under no circumstances should you take this course or even this specialization so long as this assignment is gating it.
This course tells you to use a timer while studying without the TV on and to avoid procrastination.
There's no real point to the course if you can't test your knowledge.
Duke.... Coursera... guys, come on!
I wish I could have received a refund.
That is what they said 3 years ago.
The first course on Python from University of Michigan was really very good.
Too much version specific details.
Instructor was reading slides vs explaining the technologies ( telling a story )The Quiz part cant be more lame
Truly disappointing.
Forget Coursera - I'll just buy a book and work through it like everyone else I know.
If something is difficult to use, then people will likely not use it.
I'd spend my time elsewhere, personally, especially since this course was something for my own personal edification and not a requirement.
This course was required by my director, but it is not for those who have no background in law (which was the case for the group of us at CDC who were required to take this).
No forum, what are you thinking!
I paid in advance for the complete Digital Marketing Specialisation which is a 1 year subscription thinking I can complete the course anytime I want (that is how they advertise it).
Dont know why you add this into such a good specialist.
The certificate doesn't show hours per week and the topics we did during the course.
GOOD:topicsBAD:presentation (poor sound, unprepared and unrehearsed presentations, long intro's, unjustified use of greenscrenns, etc)shallow with regards to the theoretical aspects of what it is presentedassignments are mechanical (easier than the tutorial and you have to perform the same tasks for different constants for several times)
Not a class for the beginning programmer.
i'm not sure where this is all going.
So it is difficult for me to write such a critical review.
I, for one, need to see what other people are doing and not read long pages of horrible written explanations.
I paid for the course just to be able to do the exercises, which I also think it's a minus.
All in all it didn't "ENHANCE" my career prospects, mostly because nothing useful was taught here.
But looking at the upcoming materials, you need to have a solid background in programming to complete this specialization.
The first 4 weeks, it is hard to impossible to succeed through the exam.
I want a refund because it's too easy, this is stuff I learned in freshman biology.
lectures are too fast.
dropping out.
very redundant and lacks diversity
just to be able to submit peer-graded assignments... talk about greed
Everyone gets different answers and without an answer key, no one knows what is right and wrong making it is almost impossible to pass.
One of the paradoxes is how little paradox there is in war, after reviewing and reflecting on the lectures and the reading materials.
Market is not mentioned in this course at all.
What requirements and schedule, guys???
I am a working professional and my schedule gets very busy when I am on projects.
This is a lie.
You should rename it to 90s style history of comunication from Bell to nowdays with useless facts about it.
I watched almost all first block but then I understood that I learnt nothing than I tried the IoT block, but it still wordy and superficial.
The TA's response to my complaint was flippant and WRONG.
It does allow the purchase of a specific course within the specialization, the student has to subscribe to the all specialization even if they are only interested in one course only.
Second, the material was pitched at a very basic level, but not in a good way.
Need A LOT of time to finish this course.
Not about the actual effect of food on your health, it's just a cookbook.
The teacher asked us to do tons of things without explaining how and used tons of complicated math formulas without explaining what they were, what they did, or when and how to use them.
Course is very high level and teacher inspiring.
This course is supposed to be the most interesting, and most challenged one of this specialization.
Course Project is way outside of what was taught in class.
This course really doesn't offer anything substantial in a practical sense.
Totally unimpressed.
in the last lecture on image processing, the instructor gave 16minutes tutorial on manipulating image pixels and then gave a link to a website to explain everything about ImageProcessing, a much heavier topic than working with pixels, and even it was not in Swift but Objective-C which i have no knowledge in that language and it wasnt stated in the course that it was a prerequisite.
final assignment is quite vague on the requirements needed by the instructor.
Apart from stating the obvious nothing new.
If this course is to be offered on Coursera, it needs major rework to take advantage of the platform.
This is a real shame, because there is some great content here and obviously a lot of care has been taken to structure it carefully for the original Stanford course.
Very poor presentation and content.
The two lecturers are not explaining anything properly, they are just showing slides and handing out links.
The only useful part of the course is Module 4, which is outside the scope of the course and taught by guest lecturers.
I would not spend time on this course and instead find another source for learning WordPress.
The videos are about 5 minutes per week.
Unfortunate!
Maybe 5 hours per day.
Disappointed.
There is no doubt a lot of work put into this, but it is painful to take part, so no thanks for me.
Moreover it was the longest of all the courses.
Obviously smart and capable researchers, but teaching the lay person is not their strong point.
Too many mistakes in the math.
There are about 77 minutes of lecture in total, i.
e.
Furthermore the sound and video quality is poor and I have decided to quit this course after the first week and a half.
And on I could go.
The only good part about this course was the last section where they had guest lecturers, some from Coursera - those were all excellent.
I could not understand many topics and it seems that content has been missing from this course.
I was incredibly excited to start this course.
Maybe I was wrong but I expected more medical course with many practical examples and the course is sth like 'explore your creativity in the field and be prepared'.
How many resources do we have (time etc)3.
wow.
The rubric that I had to use to mark my peers' work meant their analysis had gaps because the criteria for assessment is not transparent AT ALL during the submission of an assignment (they are starkly different in terms of details).
All to say that I have been quite frustrated despite my best efforts to learn from these materials and much MUCH more can be done to improve the actual content of the lectures.
Please consider adding alternate resources AS WELL where learners can go seek the right answers if the answer is not provided by the lecture materials.
The instructor will give you a one sentence explanation and definition for a term (literally, I downloaded the transcripts to help with my notes and assignments) and then say, "Now that we learned x..." and fly right into the next term.
)My recommendation to anyone is to never believe anything Coursera tells you about a course.
It's as if I'm being bombarded with random topics, in addition to the fact that the instructor literally stops using excel to teach.
Still canny program.
This course is not free.
His lectures need serious upgrade.
Lecturers speak too slow, I have to use the 1.5x speed not to fall asleep.
I just think Coursera is crap and this has been a very unpleaseant experience for me.
I'm going to warn my colleagues away as well.
I expected to receive knowledge about negotiation.
Seriously, what the hell?
There does not seem to be anywhere to try and find out how to fix this.??????????????????????
Th first three classes are very 'thin' in content and the assignments are easy.
I spent over 100 hours alone on the assignments.
I felt like this was her first time.
I have found this a deeply frustrating experience.
All the materials keep changing during the course.
one of the most boring courses I have ever taken.....
I had to force myself to finish it.
The lectures on git are sssoooo dull that I could not stay awake no matter how much I wanted to.
I do not like this course.
This course was so convoluted and not practical that it made me lose complete interest in the specialization.
So I just fail and retry and fail and retry.
They were short and high level without any coding to back them up.
It is possible to blaze through the first four weeks in a couple hours.....
and then spend weeks on the final assignment because you will need to learn most of it on your own by looking through api documentation.
To the instructors: If you want to see what a good "intro to language" course looks like, checkout:https://www.

org/course/programming1
I think the intention behind including this course was probably well meaning.
The pacing and tone of the speech was challenging for me to listen to.
You spend perhaps 20% of your time actually practicing coding, and the rest is wasted in libraries you will never use again.
Reading material provided explains mainly the company profile, a few links are blocked due to geographical restrictions, reports that are available are to be purchased etc.
And the demostration was very poor.
It seemed that she was unsure of her subject matter and script.
(and I am surrounded by IT professionals in my company for reference).
Great and very informa
Were those tests or jokes?
Or something that gives people the idea that the course is about very basic information about emails.
It is very old technique of teaching
I did not learn what I had initially thought I will.
There are other higher rated Universities that take a more noble approach.
Will share these observations widely.
Spends most of the time looking to the computer screen instead of toward you and reading the text instead of explaining in understandable manner.
All core concepts such as data types, data structures are explained very sketchy.
complier error all the time!!!!!
This should be said before I enrolled in this course.
This course, on the other hand, is a total waste of time.
I can code fluently in HTML, CSS and Javascript, but can't figure out how to upload a PDF assignment here.
I reported this problem already many times..
Should not be included in the specialization...
The course is more an exercise in flexing Ivy vernacular than it is actually teaching.
In fact, his lessons are nothing more than useless 'white noise' and ill attempts at humour.
I recommend NOT taking this course.
The mentors will ignore any help requests that deal with the bug in their code.
The assignments involve a lot of hand tuning of PD controllers.
Wow that was a waste of my time.
So many broken elements, mistakes etc.
That's it?
For the other part of the exercise I spent 1 hour.
Complex concepts (e.
g., regression), which cannot be taught in such a short course format (I know from extensive prior training), are taught here in an arcane way.
But eventually I fell completely behind and by the time I was performing the exercise 2 submission I was in deep water.
Despite the good lectures, the assignments don't help you develop the knowledge required for ML developer role.
Taking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery, from summer 2016 to summer 2017, finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled.
However while attending the course I became more and more disappointed.
what's the point ?
This information should have been provided when I enrolled!
Charging people for a certificate in this "class" is tantamount to what diploma mills do as the course requirements are not up to even senior high school level coursework.
However, with out an outline, slides, notes, structure... something... anything... this class is just a talking head that is painfully hard to pay attention to.
You are trading if that is your goal.
Second: who gives a flying fig about what part of the brain is engaged?
Hopelessly fast, compared to the excellent Basic Statistics by the same team.
Pathetic rating system.
Which-examples-might-best-illustrate-the-feature-I-am-trying-to-teach is pedagogy 101.
This is definitively true.
Very knowledgeable educators.
Course is given in a q&a style which is very very good for a web based course since the questions often are exactly what i want to ask.
However, think the course can still be improved, especially in the following aspects.
Just following a text book, without an added value from the lectures.
Extremely boring and very confusing
Some on the discussion boards were able to submit, but other couldn't.
This is a very important subject in data analysis and these poor explained classes could make lot of people give up the specialization.
Hard to understand what he's trying to say.
I had the impression to see dozens of INTRODUCTION videos about sustainables cities.
Badly needs to be updated.
The videos are very short and feels like a layman is trying to motivate you to write something, that's all.
This should be a course on its own, and much less be charged for.
I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.
The time allocated for this topic is not enough.
This seemed like a very generic project with almost no collaboration between the professors who taught the previous four courses.
I paid for an empty paper.
Poor material per week.
Very disappointed.
Week 3 application assignment is buggy.
Assignments consist of transcription of formulae given in lectures, and then manually searching the parameter space for solutions.
The content is many times just rushed through and it's visible that the lecturers at several occasions have difficulty even to read their own slides!However, the worst part of the course are the quizzes.
I may return to the transcripts of the course content here, but I won't be submitting any coursework.
This course just explains who the actors, their roles and environment they operate in.
I signed up to get some experience and to also get feedback from those more experienced than I. I'm less interested in what my peers have to say and more interested in the feedback of the instructor who has years more experience than most of us.
It all gets even worse as all assignments build upon the code written in these exercises.
The assignment instructions are unclear.
And unfortunately, these guys have an awful English accent.
The other courses let us take the quizzes without paying money.
Severe lack of support (zero) from the professor or TAs.
Teachers are not actively present.
She places herself in front of the camera and one cannot see the placement of the student's fingers or most importantly what is actually happening on the fret board with the finger movement.
This course just touches very superficially the subject to be studied.
This is a really weak, and not very smart course compared to the other two in this specialisation (strategy formulation & strategy implementation)
It made taking the quizzes fairly impossible unless I wanted to spend my time googling the answers.
Done with your course.
the cost
The questions rotate through slightly different questions each attempt so you can't simply use elimination on each attempt, YOU GUESS EVERY SINGLE TIME.
I am so glad I am not paying for this course.
By week 5 I had lost the motivation to go on and was only able to finish it through a great deal of trial and error on the quizzesI would not recommend it, unless you have some basic knowledge of the economic theories used in this lesson.
The second video was so incredibly dry and boring that I completely lost interest.
I do not know what this instructor is looking for as a form of assessment/analysis paper, and only those who are lucky enough to meet sensible peer graders pass.
$40 is way too much to spend just to learn how to install a couple pieces of software and sign up for a GitHub account.
Breathtakingly bad experience.
He's clearly extremely intelligent, but fails to relate these concepts to the student in order for the student to take away anything more than "These complex concepts and tools exist."
Extremely difficult to decipher what is important and will be tested, and what is not.
Didn't like the course though did only one week.
Very boring.
I was really, really hoping that this course would be educational.
I was disappointed in the lack of explanation for the tools.
This course had almost no lectures.
This is probably the worse course I've studied on coursera.
It was as if the principles of instructional design and adult learning were abandoned entirely; there was minimal instruction and I had to rely on my intuition and the assistance of a study buddy to work hard to complete the course.
If the maths required is so high, please take a week to first explain the math fresher required in course and then start the main course
A few hours' worth of reading up specs that I can also find on Wikipedia.
This course doesn't offer much of a learning curve.
Not practical for use in UX design.
it's a shame to split a one month course to four.
The audio is bad, the sound editing is bad, the "videos" are mainly static slides that sometimes aren't even showing what the audio is talking about.
Actually, from what it seems, the main point of that course is to get the students to purchase the full package of courses that the Georgia Tech Language Institude is offering.
Neither statistics nor R was covered in any meaningful way.
Coursera didn't used to be like this.
Asked about how to be more involved in class discussions and peer reviews a couple days ago and haven't received feedback.
One is penalized for being late with assignments and must shift to a new session if one is late.
I've found similar courses on other platforms which cover the same material.
I've watched all the videos of the first week and it's mostly about nothing.
The course was not what I wanted
However, that's just not enough to make up for Professor Gearey's flibbertigibbet style of exposition, which seems to make up the bulk of the course.
On a technical level, the un-corrected transcripts of "lectures" were a huge headache, since they didn't make much more sense than the lectures themselves, and at times made even less sense, due to incorrect transcriptions.
These segments add absolutely zero value.
Finally, this is my personal opinion.
While the money invested is not refundable now, however coursera with university team needs to seriously resolve this point.
The only thing you'll learn through the experience is that some people should stay as far away from writing autograders as the planet would allow them.
Additionally, the information presented in this course is available in several better structured and presented versions both on Coursera and other MOOC platforms.
The material itself isn't bad, but the course instructors never respond to questions.
As other reviewers have noted, this course is NOT for beginning programmers!
I would give it ZERO stars but can't submit this rating without giving it one star.
How can you learn anything in 5 minutes?
Super disappointed.
If the material is completely new to you then it will likely leave you confused as it does not adequately explain the concepts.
I recommend the Python classes from Michigan over these if you are looking to avoid paying for old material.
The course is not updated.
I think this course if poorly organized.
Instead of giving fundamentals of the language, course instructors prefer to give you a bunch of non-standard libraries and teach you a couple of randomly selected methods which could be applied to images.
For all of the hassle of setting up my Android environment, I get one week of lectures/exercises out of it and that only covers rudimentary functionality.
Very simplistic concepts and tactics which are already known to most of us who have been working for a while.
Only an introduction which was also not proper.
If this class is for people who english is a second language, it should be more obviose.
Most of the information in this course is common sense.
I stopped partway through.
In the lectures they don't mention anything which will help you to solve this time consuming assignment by the way.. After having this terrible course experience this weekend, today (14/11/2016) I decided to apply for refund.
The course notes are next to useless and the video are equally unhelpful.
Often times, the audio presentation were inconsistent with the words in the slide, making it confusing because I didn't know which I should be following.
Thanks a lot
Will stay away from this school.
As icing on the cake, there is an 8 hour project at the end of the course .. and they only tell you at the end that you should have been working on this all along!
Really horrible in instruction, experience and application ability of lecturers, poorly put together and assembled.
But I suddenly got a message saying that I have completed the course.
First the Coursera is using Cloudera VM, but if you execute and run the Cloudera Express to set the Cloundera environment up the Coursea exercises do not run There should be a warning!.
Final Project is far too difficult for this course, because it did not prepare me at all.
Some quiz questions were biologically inaccurate i.
e.
Extremely basic intro, not valuable if you have any understanding of the the space
No factual tools !
MCMC is only skimmed over and the introduction to MCMC is more than questionable - instead of showing a simple example, MCMC is squeezed into the topic of bayesian model selection.
They mentioned Jetpack but didn't say what it was.
With so many people taking this course for whom English is not a first language, even these very simple instructions were often misunderstood and people had problems with getting credit for their assignments.
Another example is the instructor's eschewing of password managers while many knowledgeable folks in the infosec community today recommend their use.
Coursera needs to upgrade their IT infrastructure for it to be real time.
The content is very focused on engineering projects.
Too abstract and unroganized
Instructors usually just give formulas without further explanation.
Too many obvious things.
Not adapted to an online format.
Forums were cluttered and not monitored often.
It is impossible to input solutions to quizzes/exams - even when they are correct, they are graded as wrong - a massive waste of time
Got as far as lesson six.
After about one hour the only things I learnt is to do "stuff" in different way (too vague concept) and the basic of photography.
That really makes you wonder how these people even passed the last three core courses....
Forth, this capstone is great for those who just want to get a certificate for the sake of having a certificate.
Very difficult to apply the knowledge without some support material with the content, e.
g.
What happen to the delete button on the class.
l
The instructor and provided materials fail to adequately explain the concepts this course is supposed to cover, and do not prepare students for the quizzes or assignments.
I am leaving this course due to this..
Then week two the course makes references to material not covered in week 1. it looks like a week is missing between week 1 and week 2?
Most of what's said is generic keywords assembled in sentences that don't make much sense, or implies "common sense" evidences barely illustrated with vague figures and no sources to support them.
Actually you could even skip this specialization since they canceled the capstone project so investing any money and time here is a waste.
No clock or indication of progression for the queries.
I really wish I had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this, I would estimate that it's around 10% but it could very well be higher.
gets way too in-depth with the math behind regression, to the point that it deters from the learning process.
nothing in common with reality.
thanks for the course, but-your quizzes is real pain, some random variable could cause wrong result-your should follow how it is implemented in lectures in stupid way, like "efficient" way when you build hash map N^2 instead of N-bluej sucks you make a lot of clicks to run method, use some decent IDE like eclipse or idea
Having Professor Shelton read his powerpoint slides is a very dull way to convey information.
If one has taken the Algorithms 1 and 2 course by Profs.
I would quit if I hadn't paid all the way through in advance.
The explanations drag on and make no sense.
Firstly, the amount of content is ridiculously small - only about 20 minutes of video lectures per week.
This course disappointed me.
The educator is really wants to be boring.
I don't know what happened but it seems they had technical or some other problem while preparing this course.
I am disappointed because the course doesn't provide profound material on data analysis with python.
sorry i am off...
with Dr. Shane Dixon by Arizona State University.
Poor presentation skills (mostly reading slides)Unclear and inconsistent in what pre-requisite knowledge is needed for the course (in one place he assumes one does not know digital logic, but then later he assumes you know hardware languages, fpga design, etc.
Course lectures are interesting however end of section quizes have no relevance to the material taught.
You have to pay to upload the assigments , this does not pas in other courses ...
I think it's useless.
It should be called "Statistic and binary modelling with little use in excel".
Audio is terrible - can't continue
Very poor Server capacity.
Very disappointing course.
The title is very misleading.
Terrible course.
This course is not well moderated, the material is confusing, and the quizzes were not tested before uploading them onto Coursera.
it was halful
It is not free.
I have done up to week five and still am not hooked.
Needless to say I did not make it to the end which is sad because I was genuinely interested in the content.
I don't learn well just watching lectures - I can get that much from YouTube!!!
They need to change soon!
Worst course I have ever taken, both online and face-to-face.
There are no clearly defined learning outcomes at the start of each video which are cramped with stats and facts and statements such as "you will learn more about this in mooc 2" and "this will be talked about extensively in mooc 3".
6 month on and I am still on week 2.
This was advertised as a six week course, but the deadlines make it a two week course.
She made the lectures so boring with her lack of preparation that I switched to just reading the transcript.
I was expecting a course about responsive UI for website.
posts in the forum and none of the forum operators.
You don't understand anything about what you're doing, just pressing buttons.
There are no practice assignments, only quizzes.
It's clear that this course is outdated and poorly maintained, as the videos refer to examples that are not included or content that was not presented.
Needless to say, I will not be taking any other courses in this specialization.
It does not touch Hash table or Stack.
Be that as it may, however, it takes weeks to get reviews and there is NO ONE FROM THE COURSE STAFF PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE COURSE!!
The 2 programming assignment doesn't have much to do with the course.
I cannot continue this course now because I cannot complete the exercises.
It's an insult to Coursera customers, and a major failure of quality control.
If anyone spent less than 6 hours on week 1, then that was NOT the first time they took this class.
I also am keenly disappointed in the restrictive nature of the assignments/quizzes.
In my opinion showing Hitler as an appropriate leader is not the course I want to visit!
Very general, and knowledge you could easily acquire from the web.
this course was a waste of my time; luckily I found out after wasting only 6 hours on the preview.
If you're going to teach programming, have programming assignments *every* *week*, instead of dropping a massive assignment at the very end of the course.
Some topics on slides were not covered in videos.
The professors seem to create an environment where if you are too new to anything, then you should take a different course(even though every module has "introduction to .." in the title).
They haven't updated the course content to actually match what is on GitHub's page, so from the start you have to go into the FAQs to figure out where to go from there.
I understand the history of SEO but I'm not confident how useful it'll be in real-life/commercial sense.
Why a full specialisation cycle when one or two courses would probably have been more than enough ?
My initial impressions are of astounding mediocrity.
The explanations were incomplete at best and most of the time amounted to nothing more than "type this... now type this.".
Materials in each module includes readings and exams were not related.
I assume that i should have read the book to be prepared to do the quiz.
you just refer to pre made excel sheets for quizzes.
Tests/quizes were not based on what was presented in the lessons.
I'm really disappointed in the quality of this course--specifically at how vague many of the instructions were in the quiz questions and the final project-- and that most the time when explanations were asked for on the message board the professors just did some hand waving and said that figuring it out was part of the assignment.
I am appalled that such research exists, and ashamed for the coursera
Very American perspective.
This generation already is familiar with everything taught here.
Bad material, poor graphics, wrong mc questions in videos.
More hype content than a course.
This is not the way to learn Python, seriously don't take this one
It needs project based exams, not quizzes.
It is hard to justify that for example "week" 5 consists of a 7mins long video and a simple quiz... "Week" 4 is 15mins...
In order to complete the assignments, one needs to spend lots of time learning things not covered in the course.
Files used were for an older version of Meteor.
js which made installing the application and doing the assignment really confusing .
This is not an indictment of the instructor, but of the content itself.
This course presumes a comfortableness with coding that I simply do not possess as a teacher of high school science.
The teacher's voice on first lessons are so flat and plain that is very boring to listen them.
The teacher lacks the ability of mathematical description, including clearing defining concepts, describing everything in mathematical languages, and showing math formulas of t-tests.
There were no explanations for wrong answers, and so no opportunity to learn.
I have always been appreciative of free courses that are provided by universities, but this course is clearly biased.
After finishing week 1, I have decided to stick with Duke university's Medical neuroscience which is starting up again.
- that is probably one of its key benefits.
I got really passionate and worked hard on the theme, and after completing I felt that It did not gave or matched the expectations on the course name/subject .
Benefits:1)Important theme ( within business context) discussed with good videos and references2)Historical perspective on Creativity is sound3)Prof. Shlomo Maital is a warm, highly informed and passionate person about the subject.4)The course in week 2 and 3 makes you think on your one key creativity processesAnd it almost stops there since the purpose of the course gets flawed by the lack of requirements in the peer review, supporting materials and forum "health" that is why the course talks does fail in training/ teaching.
Key points to not advice this course - at least in the paid version - see until n.51) Lack of support materials2) Support based on the ZIZOZI book to be bought outside of the course cost3)Reading of the ZIZOZI book in the context of the course ( with some answers to the quizzes being in the book and not in the course material)4) Dive into very interesting methods made only superficially ( Da Vinci Method, IDEO pex) with needs to be explained further.5) Complete or near complete lack of requirements for the classification of the peer review, making it very flawed ( see the definition of scalability per example and how to rank it)6) Forum use and reply almost near nullnessI do expect this course to be revised deeply in its execution.
Divergent thinking per se.
)If you have no programming experience, stay away from this course!Otherwise, if you want to learn R, look for other resources, and save yourself some time and money.
It's just some sort of fact-dump of Android and iOS, which ist current, but will be outdated within four weeks (seriously).
So, to keep up with this issue, it's just better to read some blogs about this or type "ios vs android" in Google.
Where is the actual information ,are some parts missing , are they payed ?
It was extremely difficult for me to fully participate without paying.
I was going to take all the courses in this specialization.
The things you are saying about language are not merely willfully ignorant, they are highly offensive & prejudicial.
Tonal explanations are good, except for the green line where you are not told how to choose what part of that tone to pronounce every time.
Not recommend.
But then, I try posting on the forums to receive help only to have it removed.
Irritated
The most boring course ever.
Ultimately, I felt that unless someone either has previous experience in coding, or has no work to do other than to do this course, it still is not worth it to just obtain a certificate.
I wish I could have my money back.
Our assignments were simple and I felt no excitement in doing them.
Concepts seem abstract outside of any programming practice.
I didn't like it.
waist a lot of time debugging but still couldn't pass the assignment.
total waste my time and garbage course.
After that I pretty much lost interest in the course.
Heavy contents..
Took one of them seven times just changing answers.
Coursera used to be a platform I used and recommended.
It doesn't include any Tableau-related activities.
Thirdly, quizzes are ambiguous and very general.
Overall, this course is just a waste of time.
Hardly the best way to learn the intricacies of this subject.
Aside from getting yourself thinking about using Excel and some minor lessons learned, I found it to be a complete waste of time.
I find this bizarre, to say the least.
not practical, some audio files are not working ...
I can read faster than I can listen to a video.
This course is a waste of time and money.
Far better to look out for the "Data Analysis and Statistical Inference" course by Duke on Coursera that is presented by a passionate statistics teacher, covers the same material (and more) and provides a far better introduction to R than this course.
One of the stated purposes of this specialization is to clean up the way social scientists conduct science and are perceived as scientists; in this respect, it appears that the worst enemies of social scientists are social scientists.
However, I have since decided it is worth 1-star after taking the next course in the series, Bootstrap.
The lessons on presentation skills and traditional media should have taken just one one or two minutes, and one or two slides, at most.
A lot of overcomplicated terms, where you can describe your idea in a much more simple way.
So academic... Interview with students has no value and no point.
The technical support of this course is just terrible: just like many many other students (see the Discussion forums), I have experienced serious difficulties to access the databases platforms we need to learn and to complete our assignments.
This course does not belong to this specialization.
Poor, very poor course, worse course structure.
Never ever a beginners course.
E.
g.
I've followed much harder courses with pleasure but here it was torture to finish it.
(I'm also a web/js developer, so I'm used to intense struggles with really abstract stuff.
Totally useless.1) Why is she speaking so so so slow?
Unfortunately this framework isn't very competent, so there's only so much you can do with it.
Be prepared to get a bad grade from someone who's clueless about hotel business, not to mention revenue or demand management.
This course has great videos.
Don't give them money!
(not only slides or phd thesis)
I think this program should reevaluate itself so students such as me can keep up with the assignments.
Not much teaching going on here.
making wild assumptions) our ways through the entire capstone due to lack of necessary information.
Third (and most importantly).
Moreover, more than 50% of content is just non-relevant.
Secondly, practical assignments are very poorly planned:1) in weeks 3 peer graded assignment students are asked to save Tableau workbooks as twbx files, even though this feature is not supported by Tableau Public that is used in this course.
There are far better tutorials on the web.
Poor material, terrible french accent, not a good Android course at all.
I don't raccoment it unless you're a total novice at Android development.
The JAVASCRIPT part of the course was to difficult for me I didn't understand enough.
It is a 3-4 week course stretched out to 3 months so that students can be charged money $$$.
It should not be a paid specialization.
They're still stuck back there and the staff of this course is really just not around and doesn't care!
There should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in the videos.
Unfortunately, I can't gain those moments that I've spent on this course back.
It's like a big commercial.
the content is too rich, and the explanation is too little.
Watch one or 2 lectures before you join the course, if you felt okay then go ahead, otherwise don't waste your time and money, something wrong in the course structure...
I am sure the teachers know their stuff but they have no idea on teaching it clearly based on the material presented in this course.
Professor needs to emphasize on basics before going advance.
We should be told before we do a piece of work that we can only submit it by upgrading, not afterwards!
If I asked the average programmer to evaluate the MT based on comparisons with the Complutensian Polyglot and Codex Alexandricus, the effect would probably be about the same.
Another glaring omission for beginners is a battery of exercises for each concept/skill.
As for "We've organized all these topics into units that represent roughly 4-6 hours of work each," that is absurd!
I am not from an IT background but still found it very useful.
It seems like you're paying for the UC Davis name on the certificates rather than the content.
In addition to all that they dropped the price from $119 to $79 per course for the specialization after I paid for it, and refuse to refund the price difference.
It is hard to be constructive when you do have something brilliant to compare with.
The very first thing to say is that the course is presented through poorly drawn cartoons for 5-year-olds and ineffective lecture videos with little or no eye contact with the instructors.
The quizzes contain ambiguously written questions for no good reason.3.
The assignments are way to general and do not require much preparation, which hardly makes them serious learning exercises.
Very poor that in order to submit any exam I have to purchase the course when I can download the book and learn as well.
The teachers there do not do what they teach: they rattle down their text as fast as they can speak and do not emphasize the content with movement or even change of expression.
I want to make sure you realize, that is NOT what this specialization is!
also missleading concepts
Mostly just a waste of time.
This course is badly structured, with proposed tasks not being well oriented, and videos where teachers are constantly doubting and making mistakes.
Very simplistic approach to subject matter
Terrible...
can't believe how a quality the course is.
I repeat myself, the study material was very lacking and consequently not enough for the assignments themselves.
No methods explained other than some terminologies like bible, acts, outline being thrown at you.
The course has been released way too early, clearly it lacks most of its content and what does exist isn't working properly either.
I have prior coding experience in other languages and I still have no idea what the instructors are getting at.
No actual class, just for selling books.
There has been no response to any of the so called, "comment on this assignment" messages I've been leaving since JULY.
No general ideas how to solve the problem.
I really did want to take this course in a specialization mode.
Just awful.
The course is very disappointing and useless.
Not what I expected.
This class setting is interesting.
There is only one moderator who finally did his job and showed up to deal with some issues that many classmates were having (including myself), and even his response time is only once every week!
not of a worth
It was too advanced for me
You guys are just trying to sell your book.
I was committed to working with the course but by week 4 it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help.
and the assignments it was very long for example 20 instruction for every assignment it is very boringmany people don't like record videos it is a bad idea
Very disappointed about this course.
Though they vary in depth, each leaves you with a good understanding of the concepts they teach.
The course is as much about computer programming as it is about statistics.
Seriously, not even these minimum wage jobs will hire you if you didn't go or aren't going to college.
very difficult to follow the lectures due to the heavy accent
In week two, the entire language was dumped on us with no real exercises.
Not So help full about Smartphone.
This is really meant for people that are learning to speak English and don't know how to pronounce words or how to respond to people in a really easy way.
Far from being a real course, it need polishing, at this point it looks more like a basic tutorial with a few error, perhaps next versions will be better.
Please get a more enthusiastic prof
Redundant, poor explanations and a complete lack of examples about the general concepts and the foundations of this discipline.
Normally I don’t leave feedback unless I feel strongly about something, so I hope you take it seriously.
It was advertised as a beginners class and that is not the case.
The initial presentation was misleading (and I have found online many people sharing the same feeling).
The best parts of the lectures were when the instructor was taped at venues pertinent to the course.
Priced at £39, the course materials that are spread to 5 weeks could easily be done in 1 or maximum 2 weeks.
Now I payyed 315 euro for nothing but disappointment!!!
This course is not about Excel or MYSQL.
This was really strange to me and caused a huge amount of time to be spent searching online or trying mid-lecture problems to no avail.
The fact that it actually costs money simply adds to the pain.
Please stay away from this course.
You do not know what you are getting into until you take the first class.
homework was poorly structured and not adequately discussed in the lecture videos.
Most part of the assignment just focused on making some comments.
No professor monitoring of the fo
the video gets stuck a lot and the problem is not my internet.
I would also assume, given a and b, that there would be higher retention and comprehension.
The course was not very structured and did not draw from the other courses in a substantial way.
)On the other hand, if you want to examine the diversity of photography through a variety of critical approaches -- Marxist, feminist, queer-theory, post-structural, whatever -- well, they don't allow none of that there here.
It's such a shame.
A giant and complete waste of time.
Diffuse modes are described as being as important as focused modes.
I would not recommend this course to anyone.
I suppose I will be censored if I explicitly mention similar sites to coursera but these kind of tests and quizzes are much more better addressed.
In a nutshell, I subscribed to the full specialisation paying 45 EUR per month, the first month I was able to certificate myself with the 2 first I did ( logistics & sourcing), this second month (planning & operations) that has just started I gave up, so my final outcome is 2 certificates for 45 EUR each one.
Tolerable but you'll never get me here again.
The service from Coursera a one star.
The supplementary materials are good though.
The outline looks amazing.
I hope this fall off in quality isn't reflective of the rest of the courses in the data spec.
One needs to capture the concentration of students for a subject like Angular.
This (second) module didn't even have that.
If it doesn't work, you need to install it."
It's just a series of activities for people who have too much time on their hand and need something to do to get out of their routine.
Not a course I would recommend for anyone wanting to gain useful skills.
Very painful training, the contents reviewed in the material will not make you capable to solve the weekly assignments, you will have to learn what you need on your own.
UCI have exception course in objective C which is worth the money to be paid, but this series, are extremely below the expected standard
There was NO communication from Coursera whatsoever regarding this--no email, nothing to me or the class as a whole.
The content is just not engaging.
Instead, this course consists of a couple of people's opinions on eating, without cited evidence, presented in a feel-good documentary-lite format with good camerawork and cute children.
None of that happens here.
The entirety of this course is "watch and listen".
Wouldn't recommend participating in this MOOC
huge gap from lectures and swirl to the assignments.
This course does not meet my needs and expectations.
The course material as presented appears to be at least four years old.
The concepts are barely touched on before the student is asked to jump into training exercises that require lengthy proofs of concepts not thoroughly taught.
They are not educational.
I recommend the designers to watch "Write Professional Emails" with Gerry Landers by Georgia Tech and "Teach English Now!"
Get ready for a lot of frustration and independent research.
Try the similar class on EdX and YouTube for a much better and clear explanation and presentation.
Too long videos, you should make more short videos, instead of one boring long video.
not worth it to pay money for it
I do not have time to waste!
Using optional methods to complete this course, such as to use the textbook and forums, is too time consuming (deciphering a text book) or insulting (forum mentor responses).
To to solve the assignments, it usually involved trying to 1. refreshing yourself in math concepts not used by a beginner or non-mathematician, 2. deciphering what exactly the poorly written questions were asking, 3. scouring the textbook or internet for functions or strategies never covered in the lecture, 4. having snarky and unhelpful remarks by mentors.
The unprofessional behavior of the mentors was especially hard to handle.
I've already taken several ML classes and this one is still hard to follow.
Useless.
Is it some publicity for them ???
It's really not good this course told us a very basic things never give us deep detail and in most of course it shows us the code and you should write like this but there is no deep understand what is it
I find it to be full of new-age dreamy ramblings that do not really help in the real world.
Leadership is influence, which comes as a mixture of experience and intention.
It doesn't have the same level of detail as this, but at least I'm not watching an instructor gloss over concepts or ideas that are completely foreign to me as someone completely new to programming.
If you know how to turn your own computer off and on, look for a more advanced course than this.
I'm so sorry.
Plus, they're full of spelling errors.
There was not enough further reading and no discussion of other people's work - such as a dissection of how a company might have arrived at a product we can actually identify in the wild.
Rather than learning how I could tackle any project, I now know how to work on very specific examples of projects - if anything was to deviate from this, I'd still be clueless.
Overall, the course feels haphazard and badly prepared.
The tests were not upto the mark, where the questions were not very logical and the options were confusing.
This course is extremely hard to follow, not because of the content but because of the delivery.
All you need to do is look at all the threads of complaints.
Lots of content poorly explained.
for novices.
While the content of this course is interesting and well-structured, the way it's presented on Coursera has major problems.
As it stands, this is not really a Coursera course; it's simply a Coursera wrapper around some links to a third-party website.
The book that you buy is written by the professor who runs the course which I do not agree with.
There is nothing of substance.
How about something on the desktop Github version?
I think there are only few contents.
I would not recommend anyone to spend time on learning this course.
I am having to go out and find additional textbooks to research the basic definitions of what is required to pass the course.
This is totally disappointing.
No videos, just an interactive textbook.
Python is a great language but this class has a very low content to volume ratio (nobody wants to watch the instructor meet his life-time idol at a trade-show or watch the Intel versus AMD melt-down commercials over their lunch break).
The only things you'll end up studying are how to use the spreadsheets given and what the instructor was thinking when creating them...
Should be less detailed, or split into multiple courses, or at least should have an introductory lesson(s) or prerequisite course on basics of how R works - I found it extremely frustrating trying to learn about and conduct statistical analyses in a system of which I had only minimal working knowledge.
There are a lot of mathematical theory and programming theory references along the way as well which I did not like.
As a real world programmer I have never really felt compelled to know peano number theory.
Probably the worst class I have ever taken on Coursera.
Teaches you Java in a "toy" environment (Blue Jay) would be helpful to learn Java in Eclipse or another IDE that you would normally work in.
Professor Wright is too laconic, phlegmatic and unengaging.
No learning outcomes discussed, and the "teaching" is sort of mumbling while underlining and reading slides that are WAY TOO complicated and crowded.
Far too much repetition.
Especially when I'm paying for the specialization, I would appreciate responses to my questions.
I submitted homework for week 1.
I dislike this course because I have to complete so many assignment in one week.
They explain very basics things in the first course and then they forget everything.
Got no acknowledgement that i was turning in assignments.
This course is clickbait for the purpose of soliciting information about the private life of participants.
Barely any practical application, does not prepare you for final project.
I came to Coursera to avoid teachers and teaching styles like this.
Almost complete devoid of intellectual content.
Not happy about the course.
You do not really gain much knowledge from this course.
I would not recommend my friends and basically others to take this course.
Horribly designed and developed.
I really did not understand this course.
Instructor support was not evident in the user forums.
There are very few best practices or real examples to use anything found within.
If I wished to grade other people's coursework, I would have pursued a career in academia instead of becoming a research scientist.
The course was not prepared at all, badly improvised and with no structure.
I was hoping for information like how to teach your toddler to chew/eat difficult things (ex: whole apples).
DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.
You should do this class only if you know absolutely nothing about economics, because this is the most basic class.
The presenter is engaging and clearly knowledgeable, and the treatment of the course subject is thorough and well-designed.
Unfortunately, this wasn't what I expected from the course.
I was very upset by the end of this course.
A waste of my time.
This course is a pure advertisement for IBM products.
I have sat through 4 of the lessons and I am not very impressed.
I almost didnt understand anything!
Not English subtitles.
For example, in Telescopes (Assignment 2), can you not ask a question like "In addition to Atacama, Chile, using Google earth, which other parts of the globe may be suitable for installation of ground based telescopes?"
The material is extremely fragmented and it seems like that the instructor is just throwing information at you without caring if you are absorbing any of it at all.
The lectures and assignments dealing with Ionic were useful and informative, but that's only the first half of the course.
Too many speakers.
It might be freshman level, but certainly not more.
Could you give us some not that professional articles?The whole course is not designed in a clear and logic way.
I am sorry, I don't believe the convenience of a commercial library is good for your learning.
I wonder if all the reviewers paid $79 day 1 for this class, or did DUKE recently changed their pricing policy after the reviews...
This segment is silly.
The rest of the segments?
Coursera does not want to give me a Certificate.
Overwhelmingly academic course with very little hands on.
The expected time requirements are also wildly amiss.
Very poor teaching.
Videos where mainly repetitive and the questions seemed to be there to serve no purpose.
Good luck if you don't already know linear algebra, matrix math, and matlab.
It was too bad to not permit the students to perform the quizzes!
You are provided with a lot of weird Octave codes which you will have to complete instead of writing yourself from scratch.
The instructions were all over the place, and explanations were inadequate.
Nope, not here.
If you've never heard of linear regression or Bayes Theorem don't bother with this course.
The first three classes in this certification were excellent; this course was anything but that.
The grading for the class had ludonarrative dissonance with the quizzes.
I have looked at all kinds of documentation as well as the book, but I cannot find what I need to know, and this a barrier to completing the assignments.
I thought this course was very disappointing, to the point where I'm not able to finish it.
Practically every question of the final comes word-for-word from a book not assigned in the module readings and not available for free to students for them to study.
I paid for the certification, but now I want my money back.
This is not a start, at the end of the course, you still can't use python.
Before I join the course I have read a few chapters and from my point of view book explains material much much better.
I always hoped that there'd be a follow up on bayesian statistics, so I was really excited when I heard that a course on this topic had finally been created.
Very boring
The point is to learn statistics.
Use Statcrunch - so students can focus on statistics not programming
(Broccoli -- REALLY???
This guys just sits back and "moderates" when he can.
The best thing about this class is that it does force you to write, but beyond that, it's not helpful at all.
Seemed like the Capstone was rushed and turned into an Investment Management course...
I signed up to practice business finance modeling not investment management.
This course was not a beginning level course as advertised.
Test cases for assignments were neither document nor otherwise explained within the course materials.
There is no proper introduction, work overview or anything.
Having to pay before you take the course is really disappointing.
Very basic, for absolute beginners/ managers completely new to data (let alone data science)
Further, the assignments did not work properly at the beginning and there is no timely response of staff.
Creativity without a reason, without a real problem/question.
However, I appreciated the 'reduce harm' policy economics.
You only pointed out to one error in the slides by the way.
I'm giving this course one star because zero stars is not an option.
I wish I had read course reviews prior to beginning.
The way this class is set up makes me angry every time I have to deal with it.
Not many real life advices.
Very limited content.
The course is just terrible.
It leaves an impression of being unfinished.
what makes it worst is the fact they never show you how to build an app from scratch while the only app they have in this course, they dont do it.
Principles of Game Design has more than double hours of classes and in the assingments you actually create a game and practice new stuff.
Jack Wu is probably a heck of a developer but he's a terrible instructor.
I previously took the Android Specialization, which was excellent, so I was shocked at how bad this course was.
The teacher said that closure captures the copy of outside variable, but this is completely wrong!
then again that would require the change of the course's name.
The worst Coursera course I have taken.
The course is ok but the certification procedure is a mess!No statement of accomplishment and you have to retake all the assignments if you want the certificate and had not been verified ....
But 4 and 5 are not up to the mark and not meeting the high expectations set by the previous courses.
If you don't want to actually learn what anything means and just get walked through steps on how to do things then take this course.
Remember, the whole project lasts for 4 weeks only!Second, several documents required for the weekly assignments were missing!
dont waste your money.
A great example of how to do it right is Aric Rindfleischs lecture, which was engaging, challenging and very well structured
What the hell man?
Then you must pay a monthly fee in order to go on.
I would not have continued with the first course if I'd known that was all there was going to be.
I think Coursera needs a lot of improvement.
The lectures were good but when it came to quizzes and assignments, we do not know what to do?
I'm not installing anything.
I would rather read a book on this subject.
I would have appreciated if they followed certain steps:1) Make some course material which will help students read and revise information.2) Suggest some reading/reference material to understand the concepts which are not otherwise covered in this course.3) Use pointers(touch screen devices) to show and point out which equations are being referred to and maintain synchronicity between the information given in the slides and the one said by the instructor.4) Supplementary lectures are extremely fast paced and please don't take derivation of an equation for granted and please do explain.
So, if you are looking forward to do this course, I suggest you go forward if you have an in-depth knowledge about vectors, matrices and calculus.
It suffers from truly appalling presentation (the video lectures are some of the most boring I have ever watched), but the diversity of angles from which Buddhism is examined, and the depth of content are really outstanding.
While the course is very interesting, I found the peer review process unsatisfying.
I did as well but wasn't lucky at my first round so I developed 3 pg.
I am disappointed I have paid so much for so few content here.
Very dissatisfied.
Poor.
Then we were asked to write some programs.
Good luck having an employer pay this amount of money for software when they can hire employees that can use free open source libraries.
Shame!
Course is overwhelming.
The material is very brief, the assignments are poorly explained and structured.
The data explanation and correlation demonstrated is not clear.
I have to apologize this course was so out of date.
I am aware that I will have to complete this course to get my certification.
If you are going to try and complete the specialization for this course series I suggest you look elsewhere.
The moderators and instructors are nonexistent and cannot be reached.
not the model of learning that is encouraging or sticks.
"), whereas in other segments he works through a hundred different questions without going in-depth to any of them.
Speaker is hard to understand due to his lack of proficiency with the English language and the subtitles are often incorrect.
On the plus side, you will learn what a "ha-ha" is.
Where is the course study material and are you providing a book on this subject and Excel?
Shame on you University of Toronto!Yes, harsh words, and here's why:The course description does not reflect the contents nor the final assignment.
I am dropping the course.
Suggestions1) One person talk to the audience...
rather than 2 or 3 talking to each other2) Volume and pic quality poor3) Its going too slowly.....
just not enough "meat" to get me engaged...
esp if u compare to the course by Paul Hegarty Stanford
), all with videoclips and music which got annoying really quick.
Disappointing.
Take care.
I was thinking it will also emphasise and help us to grow our communication skills for the 21st century communication, but it's just a brief explanation of some changes and nothing more.
Assignment was "Not Verified" which is not possible seeing how before you submit you have to verify assignment.
So it was not really worth the money.
Too many things I already know and which are quite obvious, when you have some little computer science knowledge, less practical information; the explanations for installing Cloudera etc are insufficient!!
Kind of disappointed.
I don't understand how come this course can get such high reviews.
But this lecture is only start.
Long long slow lectures with lots, and lots, and lots of questions, and no answers.
Incredibly slow paced.
Lectutets do not have enough qualified to teach others.
Doesn't actually teach anything, but gives some tips by talking, the stuff that you can find by using google and clicking on the first link that appears.
Took the first two courses which were fine but this one started off poorly and just got worse, unfortunately.
Not worth it
This is just a bunch of pretty pictures.
I am disappointed about this course.
You must pay to access assignments and quizzes.
I am really annoyed with the direction Coursera is moving in regard to premium content.
The page re-loads again and again in an endless loop!
The prof. reading a the lecture and giving lot of information without any soul or teaching energy to engage.
But unfortunatelly he did not prepare for recordings of videos.
I am looking forward to the next Python course and h
I am a looser, i guess.
So I hate this course, this website, this review system and this world.
Thank you again.
The reason why I gave one star is because I don't think its content is completely related to its title.
I will never purchase anything through Coursera.
They have forced me to leave the current session, still unfinished deadlines, missing a single activity after two months of work, and enroll again in the next session, which still nor has begun, delaying all the planning I had made for the entire course and all terms of the following courses.
In short, disastrous system to keep deadlines and complete the courses that make it totally useless any planning you have to do to set the course for the months that suit you, which, in my case at least, may at risk which I can complete the full specialization before the deadline.
Purely theoretical, I doesnt go deep enough, there arent any assignments, only a quiz at the end of the week.
and that is themajurity of the questions that come back in the tests
!
Nothing to do with IoT, misleading title and waste of time, apart from several incorrections in the novel narration.
In addition, the coded template quality upon which your own code depends is horrible and thrown together.
Doesn't effectively explain how to implement the NN
Poorly organized and managed.
I was extremely let down by this course.
What course on a programming language jumps first into how to use the debugger and what went wrong with a program?
This is one of the worst.
They seemed like very intelligent and nice people but the content of the videos offered little value (i.
e., nothing new) to someone already working in corporate IT.
so i will give one star because the title is misleading.
I think this course has a lot of value, but when I started these course I was unaware I would need a few hundred more dollars and did not budget for such things.
Not what expected ...
Considering this is a course about communication, this was very disappointing.
This is crazy.
Coursera stands for its rich courses.
Like the videos, the book lacks sufficient numbers of examples.
This course needs more time to be covered in depth - it's a lot of ground to cover in just one month,
Overall, I would not recommend this course for R beginners.
Stunning waste of time.
Interesting statistical concepts, and great theory.
The design of this course seems rather lazy.
Also most of the course is just definitions of some specific terms and not practical explanations.
I would never have wasted the hours, energy or money.
When students try to seek support to fix the issues, nothing is done and they receive no response.
All the guests were women.
I was sorely disappointed that the quizzes were locked.
I paid $20 elsewhere (UDEMY) and I'm learning a SHIT TON about Tableau through them.
I couldn't access all of the reading materials and could never finish this course.
Also, I’m surprised that Coursera doesn't require a basic set of learning tools for a paid class, such as lecture notes or an outline.
for instance.
Bottom line, I would not recommend this course for anyone wanting to Learn Java for Android Programming unless you already know Java and just want some intro on Android development with Android Studio.
Goes waaaay too fast to actually learn anything.
Prof Aarabi is an award-winning professor at U of Toronto, but it turns out he knows little about iOS and has Jack Wu teach most of the material.
Tutors reading from a teleprompter comes across as robotic, lifeless and boring.
The entire course should have been the first week of the following course.
Because otherwise you will not be able to compile the code.
The majority of the slides are walls of unclear and non-descriptive text.
The course is essentially a quick history of Android and iOS smartphones that could be learned by browsing Wikipedia.
If you are confused by getting a question wrong you might want to re-try your answer.
Judging from the discussion boards, I'm not the only one with this problem.
Again, the University of Pennsylvania has missed the mark with this class and the robotics series.
Put it simply, the presenter can't teach, at least not the MOOCs.
Lecture presentation is very very robotic.
There are no external links or additional relevant material attached to even link the question to the lessons taught.
Very often he was lost in talking and he often re-explained (in detail) staff which was already explained in previous videos.
I can't believe this course is aimed at people with no experience in building a website.
I couldn't stand it so I stopped.
Dr. Egger's courses are rigorous and full of math.
This is a joke.
Shame it's in the series.
Boring and not that useful...
There's no value in that.
I would recommend to take another course of ML/Big Data from UCI instead.
There is a gap between the instruction level and the difficulty of quizzes and final projects.
79 USD?
Not that interesting.
Many buzz words little knowledge
Unclear, ambiguous direction and material that is unhelpful for building the final project
Although peer review of an assignment is one aspect of asynchronous and synchronous education, said assignment should also be reviewed by an instructor, especially when said instruction carries so much weight.
Very basic
The lessons have 0 preparation and they come up with examples that do not work half of the time during the video itself.
Various inconsistencies throughout the course.
I know this could be a fascinating course with the proper videos and visuals to help people understand it.
Obviously Coursera doesn't care.
Poor quality audio.
The gobbledygook mooc.
Personally I would not recommend
Too compact and short.
Concentrated on image manipulation which would be ok if you wanted to build visual websites for a living.
The content of the course looked promising.
Very short not good It doesnt give anything about entrepreneurship
There are no hands-on activities/assignments that get you implementing what you are (supposedly) learning.
The course was very nice and useful and the explanations were very good!The biggest problem of this course was that it required to be purchased in order to unlock the quizzes and the assignments.
I came into the class with only real basic knowledge of Python and I was hoping to be able to pick up more as part of this class.
This course is a sequence of sales pitches by Hlavac's relations.
I took all 5 previous courses in this series and they were all great.
But suddenly Coursera has changed its policy, and one can not take courses for free anymore.
If you just want to learn and gain knowledge without chasing the certificate, than the course is useless, because you can't receive feedback for your work.
I spent 8-10 hours every week trying to keep up and it just moved too fast.
The course is great, but I am very disappointed that after spend 3 hours watching the videos and practicing, I can only submit my answer if I upgrade.
Lots of notations, and would definitely be difficult for people without prior econometrics background.
I cannot generalise or apply the 'learned' information or skills to other topics or researches because I didn't actually understand the core concepts or how to use the programs.
Please read the student forum for details.
The worst EVER I've come across
This is kind of a dealbreaker.
The quality of the lectures and teaching was the lowest i have ever seen on Coursera.
I waited a long time for this class to start but now that it is here I find it impossible summon enough will to pay attention to the lectures.
i dont know why quizzes are locked even though I'm enrolled in this course and already done watching all videos in it.
and as a record i really like this topic so it is the tacher, I took the first course and it was a good experience but this one is owfull
It's just a waste of time and money.
Then there were games to "purchase" online to facilitate teaching my dog cognitive skills.
A disorganized mess.
Instead of auto-grading using well known testing frameworks (like other Coursera courses), the entire grading policy is based on reviews from fellow students which makes your grade subjective, secondly, since the number of mandatory required reviews for each student is fixed at 5 (and is not adjusted with the number of students), it is highly unlikely that all submissions will be reviewed or graded.
Strong Mathematics skills required.
The minimal information provided and low level of the instruction at least clarified that this specialization is not worth pursuing.
Examples from real life could boost interest.
Thank god for the swirl assignments which make things much clearer!Also the course proceed very fast not giving enough time to the concepts.
Please make the necessary changes to better Coursera and make it a more positive educational experience.
You either happen to have the same idea of the teacher or you don't, and this is not professional.
Disappointing course with little added value, and in my opinion, hurts Wharton's image.
Overall, the Wharton Online Business Finance Modeling Specialization is not worth the ~US$550.
Of course I can access the course material, but the fact that cannot even manually check if my answers are correct with certainty makes all of this less efficient than simply learning it by myself.
There is not one posting from course staff in the forums.
So go out there and think of ideas that I can't think of right now."
This isn't just lack of understanding physics, or history, or flow mechanics, it is just insane.
In summary: this is not a history course, but the "teachings" of a lying, exaggerating, cherry picking cult with no knowledge in particle physics, cosmology, chemistry, biology or even history.
So please: if you take this course, be aware of this pitfalls and their intentions.
Course 1 was really enriching, but this second stage didn't achieve the level that it's supposed, videos should be remake in order to connect with learners, materials should be upgrade to fulfill expectations.
Then, in order not to completely ruin its reputation, Coursera put a bunch of slides calling it an online course and expecting people to buy this lie.
I might be wrong and this could be only my theory and nothing else, however, I won't recommend Coursera to anyone after this.
Fortunately, the other courses in EIT Digital series are very interesting.
This course does not add value
Poor lectures, inaccurate and incomplete information.
The course also doesn't allow me to be creative (although it's about design!)
At any rate after one week of this course and not seeing any improvement, I've decided to call it quits.
PPT slides.
If you're an auditory learner and prefer the old school, pretentious, Ivy League lecture hall format this is the class for you.
As a 4th year medical student, I see that the information is superficial.
There needs to be some warning on how to interpret and manage the files so that you get the same numbers being asked for in the test.
1 star for Ostervalder's business model canvas, the real mark of this course is 0 stars.
For example, there might be a discussion of leadership or respect but no ideas about what those look like.
With all due respect to the lecturer (its obvious that he is intelligent and an expert on the subject), I found this lesson not easy to participate because of inordinate learning curve and fast accent.
The techniques Pavel Kochkin is promoting are basic to say the least.
How do i interpret the results of the regression for making informed business decisions?
Back to the wonderful work of Paul Hegarty from Stanford University on iTunes University and YouTube for me.
University of Toronto - you should really consider what your teaching staff are doing before you unleash them on the world.
No option of completing the course without paying.
Very bad way of teaching and not reach content
But I have 3 bad marks and only 2 good.
It would be ok if it were an accidental mistake, but this seems to be purposeful.
It would be nice to see more detailed explanation instead of reading the lines in slides.
It is not university level learning - instead it seems glib and lacking in substance.
It is really useful.
There was little of actual teaching going on in this course, the pace was too rushed for beginners and peer-reviewing was managed so poorly it was unhelpful.
Everything in here can be found online on a blog, youtube video or a book.
Not very helpful for those with a solid statistical background.
The topics covered in this course need more time for students to understand 10 weeks are insufficient.
The other parts were OK, but after the Capstone I would hesitate to recommend the course.
Very little participation so very little help to be found on the forums, and from what I can tell, absolutely zero staff participation.
or "What do you feel about the fact that since today's mobile phones have high computing ability, their components can be used to make a low-cost space based interferometric telescopes?
You're interested in this course either to (a) learn something about an exciting and ever changing field and/or (b) to have the Stanford logo on your LinkedIn profile.
This is not needed at all.
Not very well-coordinated or organized.
The professor's voice put me to sleep; he was monotone.
Just wanted to feel like I accomplished something suited to my level.
Contents, Videos, talks nothing was value for time.
How do you test your knowledge if you can't submit assignments?
don't lose too much time on it, it's doable in a day or a weekend and move on to "R programming".
asking for so much money to see how to install R and github is a shame.
feels like this course has been added just to have a round number for the specialization.
even the survey in the end asking for feedback starts with a question not adapted to moment it's been asked "did you get a certificate?"
This can be obtained through any internet reading and doesn't require a purchase of the course.
I undertook the course so I could learn about IBM Bluemix and IoT development, and extend my skills/understanding of the environment.
There were also actual incorrect answers in the videos on occasion, so that even if you did do things correctly, you would think you were wrong and be confused, and there were a lot of inconsistencies between the spreadsheets used in the videos and the methods used to solve things compared to the actual spreadsheets given to us, which makes things pretty impossible to learn.
A huge disappointment :(
I guess I should have tried one for free first...
I tried to tell the Coursera staff to remove the course from my list and that I did not need my refund, but sadly, it sits on my 'enrolled courses' list, perhaps permanently until I cancel my account.
Well, first thing I am going to say this is not going to be looking good, however correct me if I got anything wrong or being unfair.
To be honest, I am very frustrated with this course!
I apologize if I was overly direct and wordy.
Regards,Rafael
Incredibly vague and hand wavy.
Pretty basic stuff.
Quizzes and assignments cannot be submitted if course is audited.
It's a shame that this kind of non-scientific blabber found its way onto this platform.
I am not happy with the course content and the way that the lecturer uses to teach this course.
Therefore, I would not recommend this course to anyone.
Most of it was concerned with mathematical problems.
Reading through a lot of the discussion boards, there are two types of students: 1. those like me, who have never programmed in their life, and cannot figure any of this out, and 2.
Many parts were unsuitable for this course.
How do I unroll in this course.
all of them are good instructors but the way they did it, its definitely is not a beginner friendly.
Tried to get a refund but its too late so I will have to force through this one and the next.
Instructors are just talking faces up front - they cannot teach.
Very very long lectures with ambiguous content.
Was trying to install to Linux while reading the video screen as there is little documentation or any actual explanation as to what you're doing.
Valerie clearly understands her topic but the summarizing of it for this framework is not a success.
This is real boring I just learned that
In addition, this is the lack of contents.
For improvement this course, I strongly recommend you to add create presentation and peer review assignments.
I wrote some indepth feedback, but par for the course, I can't save it - either here or on the discussion board.
A shame it is part of the cybersecurity specialization.
the tests are difficult.
It's general software architecture course.
Sorry!
I got nothing out of this course.
The lectures are monotonous and boring.
The obstacle of not knowing French is quite detrimental
If you multiplied that by 10, it would still be a stretch.
I have no doubt about the programming and technical competence of the instructors (though there are some errors in a number of the instructions).
Virtually nothing is explained.
The content of the videos are just some engineer citing with some brief headline of security, it's lacking of depth and explanation, totally wasting my time !
As a retired teacher I have more of an ability to stick to a class than many but life is too short to wait for this class to perk up.
No one should take this course unless they are powering through it for the Data Science specialization.
He doesn't actually TEACH you anything, he just takes you through the process.
Worse yet, you are required to work in BlueJ, (google it) with custom Javascript functions that you are not allowed to view or use outside the course.
Poor correlation between instruction and testing.
You may end up locked in.
This course deserves no starts.
I spend 5 hours for trying to install all the libraries and finding the correct header files of deal.
II and this visualization thing which is needed in the write_output.
h file).
No examples and no case studies.
Weeks 2 and 4 have the worst material I've seen in all the courses I've taken until today.
yeah i would give zero if possible.
If you're interested in the etiology of autism, you'll need to look elsewhere.
Could not get interested in this class
Even the peer reviews require your classmates ONLY to judge you based on whether you actually tried to answer the question, if it was between one and three paragraphs and one other silly thing that I can't even remember now.
unclear and poorly thought out
I would look elsewhere.
I have submitted all my solution long back but the last submission which was suppose to been by mentor is pending from one and the half months.
I believe that coursera is a Professional site for learners.
Through all the courses I worked hard only to reach NLP capstone?
This is far too rudimentary to be something produced by a university
Are these meant for novice or advanced learners ?3) Why so serious?
Instructor relies heavily on the use of various charts.
All I want is real, concrete feedback.
The usability challenges of password managers and a discussion of how they might be mitigated would have been more appropriate.
The course does not warrant the price, it has way too little information.
I wanted to know how many calories a meal should be based on height and weight and how that changes over time.
Just a guy talking.
I would NOT have expected to have a weeks long course on software design and usability when my desire is to learn about software security.
Also, the course hasn't made any reading material available, and they are not even providing the slides for the lectures (as of till DEC 2016).
I have enrolled and completed a course on mobile robotics from Georgia Tech on Coursera and they were using slides and at the same time the instructors were scribbling equations on the slides and ensuring that they maintain synchronicity with the learning and showing them how a particular equation emerges.
Very little depth.
never give any algorithm.
For example, when discussing convolutional nets, he casually starts talking about an embedding layer and a mapping layer, without really explaining what it is.
I have studied at least 7 courses on Coursera- of which I loved Social Psychology and Criminal, and I even paid for the certificates.
It very quickly turned into a demoralising "death march" for me.
As part of the specialisation, this course needs to be slimmed-down radically, and perhaps complemented by other analytical approaches to UX and interaction design.
But I do have to say, going into the depths of Accounting Analytics is not easy.
For instance, there are 10 Qs in week 1, 3 of them have mistakes.
Some of these issues were flagged on the forum 5 months ago and still the course material wasn't updated.
Warning: The lecture videos along will NOT be enough to prepare you for the final assignment!
I hate myself for getting suckered into this awful thing.
The contents of PPTs are just read out in the video lectures.
I don't know what is the problem as I study the videos well and when it come to taking quiz i never pass so I watch the videos over and aver again but it always the same resultthe part of other languages I'm not sure what is the point of it I mean does it help in English to know how to say for example hi in other languages plz if anyone passed the course .
The assignments are often vaguely described and, in more than one case, were described entirely differently in different places.
I have nothing good to say about this experience.
I hope the instructors review this course soon because it does not have the same quality as others.
If you are a beginner I suggest you go look somewhere else.
This course, was really bad structured, was often the discrepancy between the information provided in the videos and the questions in the Quiz.
So there is little point.
The "English" subtitles are completely incomprehensible.
), I was really just searching on stack overflow for how to put it into python.
On home screen when i click on stars to review, new window opens..
Prof. Wobbrock was great, but I think there was a lot of vocabulary assumed to be known to us that just wasn't.
!I will never recommend someone to do this course.
I found I couldn't listen to WHAT he was saying because I was so distracted by HOW he was saying it.
I did not conclude the course because of the fundamentally wrong guidance that this lecturer promotes.
Very inept.
The small number of exercises and videos does not justify the high price of the course.
I also couldn't understand some of the grading criteria.
I advice NOT to take this course.
Why: the professor is never there to read your assignments.
Gosh, I haven't heard this sound in maybe over five years...).
The Kaggle competition at the end of the course can be fun if you do the hard work, but you don't need to put much of an effort to pass.
They shouldn't compact 14+ videos in one week.
You do couple of extra videos and teach whatever you are asking in quizzes, or tell us to read a certain material.
These books are actually cheaper than this course.
There's a reason that they were left behind in the 80s.
You cannot even complete the first quiz before they demand your :P
Grading a fellow student on their accuracy when I don't know if they are actually wrong is something I never want to do again.
I had to leave the course as I found it to be a waste of my time, and I am glad I decided not to pay for a certificate for it.
So far this is the poorest course in DS specialiation.
Not really useful ~ I would like to email in a PDF file of comments
There are many examples in it, but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative process.
The high level process proposed is good, but it is into the details where the processes fails, and there are no detailed examples here.
By far, the worst thing related to this course is the peer review.
The material covered was simply running through each of the menus in Tableau.
Finally, the quizzes and assignments are completely disconnected from the courses.
The worst course I have ever taken on coursera.
The result of this was that it it required an inordinate amount of effort to understand each sentence and to put together the sentences into meaning.
Dependent on fellow students for pass not most ideal.
I can' believe i paid for the certificate.
till week 2 i think there is no useful information till now
He teaches even worse then me.
People need to talk to people on the phone or in person or the instructor needs to give better examples so people can better figure things out on their own.
I can't even make pre-course survey, which couldn't have wrong answers
The teachers do seem nice and well educated however it is still too boring and slow for me.
I would not recommend this course for a few reasons:1.
Background is not clear and not able to understand lecture
It is OK to pay for the verified certificate, however, disabling the functions in the course is a wrong way to earn money, because people who want to learn the course might not necessarily want the certificate, and this is unfair to them because it limits the resources available.
Need a good foundation with knowledge of calculus(integrals), electrical engineering and wave and acoustics.
Don't take this class if you want to learn about coding.
Would not let me leave course after signing up.
The course doesn't allow access to the quizzes unless you pay for it.
The instructor spoke so quickly in the videos he was nearly incomprehensible.
The idea is to make this courses as accessible as possible.
In addition, the complete lack of discussion forums attached to the course suggests that it is preferable to shut off discussion than to address the problems.
Don't recommend.
You're better off skimming through the ableton manual and using the search function to get the answers you want.
Bad videos.
For instance, PGP encryption is a reliable way to secure information, yet making it usable remains a challenge.
Covers basic statistics (Mean, Variance, Simple Z and T tests).
They mentioned hosting on bluehost but didn't give any instructions.
The programs didn't build knowledge piece by piece - it was just learn the language, now write these random programs.
I'm dropping out of a specialisation I paid for because the quality of the materials is really low, and the presentation is very similar.
I do not know (and I also do not care) who is responsible for this - Coursera or the instructors, but this is something that should not be present in any of the courses on Coursera.
I liked the first course very much, but the mentioned part of the second course was so annoying that I really would not recommend taking this course to new students.
Sorry.
It was very difficult to understand.
If you haven't, it will not teach you how to use it.
This made being able to take this code and to adapt it to other uses very difficult.
I would not recommend this as a course to help learn Python.
They assume everyone knows how to code in html, javascript and css.
Sometimes he only reads the slides without adding anything else to the content.
Suffice to say this is a real dealbreaker.
I would not recommend this course to any one.
I started this course because I want to learn about finite element method and not how to install deal.
II software.
Is product feedback contribution?
However, it comes across as being very monotonous and boring.
Extremely repetitive with little to no visual interest.
The tutor just read slides without deep explanations, wikipedia much more interesting.
Not great learning experience.
The lectures do not comprehensively provide the information needed to complete the assignments.
Hard to follow, ideas are not organized and are not well presented.
!a lot of record videos !!!
Canceled part 2.
If you do then the simplest Jupyter exercise it fails - this took me about 10 hours to figure out.
Then for the final Project, technically to succeed you must miss country names in all lower case and you cannot match with countries with a 'space' e.
g.
So far, however, I have found many of the lectures condescending.
Because one star is way to much for this course.
In wk3 my DB is totally messed up and I do not know where to find the CORRECT create statements to recreate the DB that the assignments expect!
Other than week 1, every week requires closer to 8-10 hours at least.
Talks were short with no real matter in them fill with jokes just to make time with them.
The only reason i passed was because i ignored the lectures and asked others for help, once i did that finance became a lot easier to understand.
If you really want to learn CSS, get yourself a good book on the subject and/or utilize the free material out on the internet.
The material on graph analytics was of introductory level.
Apparently, this course relies heavily on self-learning the lib docs given on their site.
All together this leads you to simply monkey-coping lecture materials into code editor without even realising how it works and what it does.
Completely useless unless you understand Hebrew.
Very poor .........
Never expected this from COURSERA.
Do yourself a favor - avoid this course.
Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization, it's a bit of a bait-and-switch.
Check this one Control of Mobile Robots you can get an example of a good learning curve
I was somewhat disappointed with the content of this course.
or it should be stated that one needs to read the book prior to taking the course.
lecturer is very monotone and isn't engaging.
They show a lot what can be done with swift but the never show/mention what it's really usefull for (no "real life" usage just snippets after snippets).
To few practical doings (mostly only quiz stuff)
Some lectures not longer then 2 !!!!
The course structure is not thoughtfully prepared.
homework is badly designed.
coursea does not allow me to quit the class.
More seriously, it was hard to hear the difference between "VCF" and "BCF".
this course is very basic, provides a lot of information that's not really practical or useful.
Though the course conception is good, instructor and course materials are not up to the mark....
Not very engaging.
The instructor assumes that you have a good genomic background.
I spent 97% of the time I spent on the course doing only the final project.
The code teacher used is out of maintenance, students have to spend a lot of unnecessary time fix it.
The course content is really poor, I do not recommend this course if you are actually interested in learning anything.
I find that very mis leading.
Explanations are at best incomplete, usually confusing, sometimes incoherent.
For example, when given a mean and stdev, when asked to find a value, often the lecture would use an approximation ( i.
e., a 2-tailed 95% distributed = 2.00 std devs. )
In the end, this course only made me feel like the very object of my learning: a robot.
I am really disappointed with this course.
Whilst I can see why the idea of reproducible research is important there was't really enough material in this course for the full four weeks - and in fact a lot of the videos repeated the same information.
OK, you can learn a few things getting into this course and it's still available for free on the platform so thanks for that!However and most of all, you can sense that this is more of an advertising campaign for AXA IM than an investment course per se... During the 4 modules, you're basically repeated over and over again that Active Management (ie.
Don't move on to the next thing unless they have learned the first thing.
I was unable to complete the projects because the practical coding was not taught - don't throw a third of the course into the first practice I get to without first walking me through short, contained examples of how to actually use the code, and testing me on each piece before putting it all together.
The contents are a short interview cut up over 4 weeks, fluffed with a myriad of vendor-biased PDFs.
I found that the lecturers sometimes used random terminology without ever explaining it (for example, "tags" is another word for sequencing reads, but this is only ever used in RNA-seq methodology, and then only rarely).
I expected a lot more from a Wharton-led course - very disappointing.
There is little to no connection between the topics.
It´s NOT A BEGINNER COURSE.
To give more context I have done and succeed more 16 courses , 2 specializations, followed/audited about 3 others courses and that is the first time I´m giving a bad review.
A poor introduction to programming.
Some assignments were more oriented to solving marginal problems then using Spark and distributed and parallel computing.
Looks like I had a older version of the questions while others had a different version.
But, given their rambling style, they would be much more useful as reference material rather than driving the course, in my opinion.
Many of the questions in the quizzes felt like they'd been added simply to make them up to the correct number.
The assignment code is ambiguous and the assignment is not clear!
From University of Washington I have expected the same.
You will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoever.
I often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them.
The root problem seems to be what professional communicators call "The Curse of Knowledge" -- a syndrome in which a person is so familiar with their subject that they cannot begin to imagine what it is like for someone who is not.
My recommendation to a beginner is to look somewhere else.
The other class (by CU-Boulder) made me want to continue learning ,and I felt excited to complete the projects whereas with this class I was forcing myself to sit down to finish just the required ones.
too easy
What you will learn here is not how things are done on the job.
the course videos were poor.
The software installation is hardly explained (the instructor writes a whole bunch of code in the terminal without even explaining correctly what we are writing).
Low depth of teaching, assignments awfully developed.
I am the heretic in the room: I think the student wish to appear intelligent to their peers and the emperor is in fact shamefully unclad.
It was astonishing to experience such self-promoting hacks rather than knowledgeable practitioners of the art of meditation.
no basics being taught!
The content of the entire course can be studied in less than 3 hour (so did the other courses of this Specialization.)
That's clearly not enough for a course.
Somewhere during the second week there is a gap in coding that I could not overcome and this ruined the whole interest in pursuing the course because in order to overcome it I had to cheat.
We are in a climate emergency and need to do everything we can.
This course, which is part of Data Science Specialization Course, which is a BEGINNER specialization, doesn't explain as it should to BEGINNERS.
I have completed 2 Assignments in capstone and 4 to go and the 1 year subscription is over.
The class is very very basic for the offered price.
I don't think I would like to risk another 50 dollars learning matlab and debugging the automatic grader on any of the other courses in this specialization.
For sure, it might be that I was not of the attended audience.
Interesting topic but not well executed to fit online learning
Refers to some concepts without introducing, introduces others without explaining.
Very bad course.
Instead, we get Professor Gearey sliiiiiiding into half a dozen subjects per lecture and then "leaving that question there for a later lecture.
This is by far the worse course I'd ever had taken.
What I mean is R and Basic Statistics should be separated.
To me the only value added of this course is that I will receive a proof that I know how to define basic functions in R.
This course is an absolute joke and an embarrassment to UPenn, Coursera, and everyone involved.
the volume was very low and was missing videos
This capstone project was a huge disappointment to me.
I went through the first, maybe, five videos.
The project is interesting but once again, you have to do tons of research and take up other courses to fill the gaps (might as well do the other courses instead of this one).
I do not recommend this course or the specialization.
Not being able to take the quizzes completely ruins the learning experience.
I was enrolled in the full specialisation and things went great for the 2 first courses i did, which were mostly peer-review-based (logistics & sourcing).
With this one i gave up feeling really unassisted and unable to get answers to my feedback requests.
A little example, the topic of a subject was about the mechanical properties of using multiple templates and a question in its quiz was about an electric circuit that is never shown in the question itself, only briefly shown in the lecture video for about 10s, minimal information is given without any explanation of what they mean and we are asked to enter a formula as the answer for which also almost no information is given about which notation we should use for the formula itself.
There are other cases where there are multiple choice questions which have incorrect answers accepted by the grader.
The least comprehensive course I ever took.
In one video, he corners a guest speaker at a conference, who appears annoyed after a few minutes and gives the professor a polite brush-off: "other people here would like to talk with me too."
The tests were easy.
I have a background in Python, and I was under the impression that this course would teach me how to program in Swift (seems like a fairly straightforward goal).
The class claims to be for beginners, but that is clearly not the case, as it requires previous knowledge in inferential statistics and calculus.
Excel is hardly used and is certainly not the focus; there are weeks where Excel is not used at all.
Short lectures, long intro, ridiculous music.
It was merely a regurgitation of facts.
I spent lots of time on learning on an useless language rather than learning the spirit of functional programming.
Mentors are not active.
The very worst of the pontificating profession - and what we long term learners and educators know to be all too common.
Having taken the course, I agree with that review wholeheartedly.
I am British and I understand that Richard was born in the UK but spent a great many years in the US.
It felt like following instructions to push certain buttons.
I would only recommend it to knowledgeable people with certain background, that should be listed as a REQUIRED knowledge.
Videos stop in the middle of him talking something.
Course itself is a 4 star, pretty good.
Too difficult to learn for beginners.
As an educator myself, I found this class to be rather pathetic in its structure and the assignments.
It looks like a youtube review and not a real course
poor design on presentation assignment
I have taken a number of other courses in creative writing elsewhere, and other courses on Coursera - this is the first one I have actively chosen to stop because I just wasn't engaging with it - either for education or for enjoyment.
The female presenter's speed of speech is so slow it's almost hard to concentrate on.
The questions where answers need to be filled in are so stupid that you can fill in any random letters or punctuations and it'll count as pass.
Like the comics!
i need practical information but this video was full of tables
Yes, I got some psychological basis, but that's not what I looked for/ The lecturer politely suggests to buy his book ... well if it is the same quality as the presented course, than it's useless...
It was a waste of time...
Mostly a bunch of unsubstantiated and dogmatic cliches flaunted around.
I recommend re-scripting and rehearsing the presentation -- before re-shooting it.
But still, I cant see how this course is of any use.
Professor is really bad.
Charging for free content, really??
Apart from being able to discuss the topic in the forum with other online students, what's the advantage in comparison to buying a book and doing the exercises there?This course to me started off with the wrong foot.
Adding to that, was the constant interruption of the "paid certificate" page.
The teaching method was boring.
This is missing the whole point of a online class.
Not that much techniques to learn just general course about social media,So it's not cost effective !
The creators of this course did not react to our cries of help within a week.
Course title is misleading.
The course is not taught in such a way that A leads to B, B leads to C, and C leads.....; instead the instructor will tell you about C, might explain A, and forget about mentioning B until the graded quiz.
This is not a business course.
Not a learning exercise.
Do not recommend to anyone and surely will not buy the next course.
Materials are quite good but grading is subject to broad interpretations and there is no human to provide guidance on what are the best practices.
As shown in the course, I installed an instance of galaxy in the AWS/Amazon Cloud.
It is the wrong content for your target customer.
Less than 10% contains useful information and the rest is describes the same idea "Cloud is good" with various words and phrases.2)buggy.
- no option for collaboration.
Videos had useful content about 50% of the.
Week 4 resources was by far the best and most useful.
With the information provided in the video lectures you won't recieve a grade, there's a lot of extra work necessary with no other help given then some wiki that only a math genius would understand without any further help.
That have almost nothing to do with the lectures, but require quite a bit of Matlab programming (did I mention you won't be taught any Matlab in the process?)
You know when u see a bunch of good reviews of a restaurant and then go there and the food is terrible, the place is awful and the waiters are the worst?Well, same here:.
Asked a question on the forum that another student was also having a problem and nobody answered me.
Very very boring.
Feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful, when designing character for video games is also important the skill you have or obtain while doing it and this doesn't place any emphasis into it.
I was quite disappointed with this class.
A couple of results in Q1 directly contradict the theory.
This course has so many "incomplete" pieces of information, that it requires insurmountable amounts of time to "find" the concepts required to apply the knowledge, hence it becomes a gigantic "time waster".
These two choices can be eliminated easily.
It's too short and not prepared very well.
The content is gratingly simplified, the delivery worse.
This course need a serious rework.
For the moment I finished it biggest problem was very unclear grading of programming assignments and lack of learning materials.
Assignments are extremely buggy and often touches on things not even explained in the lectures.
These lectures need to be redone.
Scattered lectures that are hard to follow and choppy
A beginner (NO programming experience) should expect to spend 15 to 20 hours on the first week alone and at least 10 hours for each of the remaining weeks.
I have over 25 years of programming experience in Assembly language, Visual Basic, C and C++.
Too much theoretical.
You quote 300 living labs, let's go !3.
This is the worst course I've ever listened, and I've listened my fair share of online courses!
I learned almost nothing valuable and found the content to be so basic that I didn't get a good feel for Tableau.
Many parts of the course relate to external videos available on Youtube.
If you're going to advertise on such a platform as Coursera please don't make it too much about the advertising and more about learning... (for example: Melbourne University Specialization).
If their system is not running a 64bit OS at 2.4 GHz with at least 8 GB of RAM, it can literally take DAYS for Studio to complete the build so that the student can do anything with assignment code.
There is a desperate need for a glossary.
As an example I am not english native speaker but a had to put the playback speed to 1.50x in order to not get bored in all videos, it was really dificult to follow the teacher at the normal velocity , i just got sleep every video.
I did the first 4 weeks of the course in 5 hours and learned nothing new, except using Tableau.
Assignments were uninspired and some questions were weird.
The proffessor only reads the slides and do nothing more.
Examples can be far-fetched (Britannica for ethical blindness ?).
The course is too boring, I am not sure if it is because of the language or the lectures.
Some videos are 2 minutes, some are 11 minutes.
I've already written a review but it seems to have been removed...
This is an awful course, there is very little purpose to it whatsoever, it is basically a module in markdown which will in all honesty not have much application for most learners.
In addition, the course is not at all balanced / laid out well, there is a peer assignment in week 1, which you need to have covered week 2's content for.
Lastly, the recording quality of some of the lectures is awful, it is clear that they have simply used some recordings of an actual classroom session of a related course instead of recording for Coursera.
In all honesty, this entire specialisation is of awful quality, it is not a data science course, it is a "here's a few useful things in R" course, and the instructors should be ashamed that their institution makes money from it.
The professor teaches by reading the slides and does not even bother to explain the concepts.
I would rename this course as Programming Octave with Application to Machine Learning rather that Machine Learning.
Mentors who responded to some of the other students were clearly getting defensive when those students were getting nowhere on the assignments.
It is not helpful course, especially for persons looking for some practical econometrics applications rather than focusing on the mathematics side of it.
boring lecturer, monotone, passionless reading of even more boring powerpoint slides and images, and absolutely no intelligent discussion going on in this course, I have learned more from reading the book "the epigenetics revolution " by nessa carey, a book written for laypersons, than I have from this course taught by university professors.
I would recommend this course for non-technical managers or security/coding beginners under the age of 13.
IMO...
there was too large of a jump between the two courses, and the plethora of "I'm totally lost..." threads in the forums would seem to back up my opinion.
We have an incredible opportunity to improve education, and I feel that this course is merely an extension of current learning techniques.
I am very disappointed with this course I had to wait too long on grading, first time I got not naff points then I had to wait for about few months on grading.
Statistics involves much of mathematics and calculus which make it a natural challenge for most of the people.
Again this too me about 10 hours to resolve.
Im not the only one complaining about this issue, you can check the discussion in the course.
From my perspective, the individual courses that made up the "Capstone" (people, customer, accounting, and operations analytics) were both educative and interactive.
Even some of the questions in the quizzes are carelessly constructed: for example, the 'correct' answer to q8 in the final quiz uses the word 'allowed' (which implies an element of discretion) instead of 'required', which would have properly reflected the provision in question (s.6 HRA 1998 - 'the authority could not have acted differently' ).
this course apparently requires a level of probability knowledge I don't
If, however, you come to this course wanting specific information about how to build great meals for babies, toddlers, and young children, or you'd like to know how their needs change over time, this course is not for you.
I paid it and got unitl week 4 and just couldn't find the motivation to continue.
I'm well aware that the only way to learn programming is by doing it yourself, but if I pay for a course I expect an explanation of how things work under the hood.
You get no feedback on your quizzes or assignments and the professor is one of the most boring I've ever seen.
Then the course SHOULD not encourage SEO beginners who has never seen SEO audits or analysis paper.
Really poor approach to grade this course.
And Pavel himself is proudly telling his story of how he lied his way into a job for which he had no skills.
Plus Coursera really doesn't want you to bother them with your silly questions, relying on peer-forums.
But the lectures didn't cover stuff with enough rigor and repetition for me to pick up much.
So I pretty much gamed the quizzes and project enough to get through the class.
Makes you think basic math is Calculus.
The first three weeks assigments were way too easy and the answers could be found in the material.
The last assignment was very poorly described and the material was very limited in explaining OOP.
The lessons are brief beyond any form of reasonableness, the teacher seems completely unconnected with his students.
too hard for a beginner
It was very poorly planned and seemed thrown together.
Most importantly, there is very little about the actual mechanism behind pricing financial instruments, instead they just state the formula.
There is a wide gap between the lectures and the practice.
I don't want to discourage the presenters, but this is not the level I expected.
Very difficult to learn something that is not "textual".
Highly disappointed...
The support from the faculty and the website is beyond explainable bad.
Also, please kill the intro video for each course.
The course explanations are very poor.
It might be useful for somebody who is just starting to work.
With approximately 4 mins per week of video charging $49 for this course is a disgrace.
And it is not making it interesting to listen.
Nevertheless, I will try to get some concepts from it, particularly for what concerns the practice of meditation and mindfulness.
Course started on 24/10/2016.
Horrific.
I feel like I still have a very poor understanding of what was supposedly covered in the course.
The founding idea of MOOCs was to make education more accesible.
Was very frustrated with this course.
Someone who doesn't know how to install software via command line?
It's not a course... this is a very short general introduction to 3D Printing
Poor grading system.
Of course the topic NLP and word prediction is interesting, but the problem is, that this is a dead course.
Not impressed with the teaching style.
Seems that lectures were being read and not taught.
I do not like the different language.
Also, judging from past discussions by students, some inconsistencies around formulas being presented in video lectures versus assignment questions.
what in Stalin's name is "tail that wags the dog"?
Week 1 and 2 were very useful.
A student is bombarded with information about regular expressions, the HTTP protocol, web sockets, URLs, HTML, XML, JSON, and APIs.
Dearth of any specific / practical tools.
very little useful information, more like PR for PWC
No content for the first two weeks.
1 for Knitr, otherwise it's waste of time.
Charging me for supporting other participants and supporting a 'learning community mindset' seems ridiculous to me.
Look elsewhere.
This class (the fourth in the specialization) required a different version of Unity 3D in order to complete (compared to the first course in the specialization).
It should be made more engaging.
The content was VERY scarce, and it was obvously prepared in a hurry.
Good introductory course.
money!
Waste of time and I did not learn anything from this course.
It is basically 6 weeks of the "facilitator" asking questions without offering much in the form of answers.
Social Media is big and therefore business must change the way they do marketing.
This is not even mentioned in the entire course.
Much of the assignment was out of date.
I feel like it should have been mentioned a lot clearer before starting that this was simply a course in how to use the creators library.
A lot of powerpoint, nothing else.
To make matters worse, the discussion forums were closed so you could not ask anything to clarify things, so it was very difficult to learn things here.
And I don't mean that the individual lessons don't have objectives - I actually mean that the entire course doesn't know what it wants to be and the instructors seem to have bypassed this critical question.
I would strongly recommend finding an alternative course devoted to the subject or maybe seeking out a readable textbook.
he is on the fourth line.
If this had been a free course I might have gone up to two stars, but I probably wouldn't have finished.
This course attempts to take complex social awareness and patterns and reduce them to an understandable set of skills to be practiced... but it fails.
This might be a good class for you if learn well from videos.2.
I have given two stars not because the course is not good but because I was unfairly given less marks and as below70% is not passed did not get to complete the course
This course Is not worth the money.
The provided material is good, but not good enough to be called a 'course'.
I watched from the beginning to the end waiting for them to start talking about anything other than naming intervals, but it didn't happen.
AVOID!
The later weeks, however, seem to be completely different.
It is like for kids, I think all courses must mention their target audience.
The sophistry present in the final module is particularly dishonest.
It is way below par.
I was expecting what it said: ADVANCED neurobiology.
I feel bad giving this review.
The course was an academic study in mediation bring is rather esoteric, questionable, and personal opinion concepts and comments; in effect a mesh-mash.
Such a waste
When to complete your assignment, Google becomes your best friend rather than your lecture notes, you know that something is wrong.
Just finished all the tests and passed, but not happy.
You speak too slow and that makes a 8 minutes video turns into 30 minutes video.
You will spend way too much time analyzing it for clues as to what went wrong.
I have trouble understanding what the teacher is trying to teach from the very beginning of course.
There was far too much very technical detail that no one save those working for hedge fund developers would ever use.
I paid €43 to learn a small amount of markdown syntax, and the quizzes and the weeks didn't even match up!
instructor is too fast, video lectures are not enough and assignment questions are not clear which wastes much time just to understand the question
Non-introductory and advanced courses in R can require students to look outside of lectures for completing relatively complex problems.
THis should maybe go after the command line course, so that at least you would have any idea of what you're doing.
Very frustrating.
This course is very poor.
Also, please refrain from over using the word 'essentially'.
You'd almost be better off reading Wikipedia articles or a book.
The videos lag behind, and the readings the first one of the first week, the link was broken
THAT is not teaching.
I have enjoyed the courses leading up to this one, but this course was obviously rushed and poorly planned.
This was really disappointing.
There is almost no connection between the experience of the lectures (and that's all the videos are - lectures that track a PowerPoint presentation) and the assignments, quizzes, etc.
I ended up with chatting with some one on the help center but that was not very helpful either.
It is not for beginners at all.
the videos are too longassignments are difficultand dr asfahani is not like dr larryi loved dr larry much moredr asfahani is not interesting in his presentations at all
I do not upport any racist mindset.
Videos are poorly narrated and are marginally effective: vocabulary + key concepts only.
i was expecting something as big as udacity but unfortunately its not.
But if this experience is any indication, Coursera isn't very good.
analysis all in words to make it look like a true analytical report, didn't pass again.
I am not going to mention that ,coz even the question in the course is full of error !
So you've completed all the tasks and in the end you find out that you just can't finish the course.3)The course is about "Cloud" as a technical term.
it is very boring course no coding just watching a lady talking and talking and talking it is really very boring to do that
Someone not proficient in English or hard of hearing would be confused by them.
In general, it seems that the main goal of the course is promote that software.
Really disappointing course.
the Java script part is super confusing!
I expected more coding examples.
Very poor course.
exam questions are designed for raw facts instead of critical thinking and resoning.
Lost my interest very quickly.
His teachers are a known quack and a tantrist.
Do not take this class.
The software is not the same on Windows, and so 'step by step instructions' become a guessing game, because many options or menus are missing or different.
There are many better and more friendly guides on the internet.
This was taking too much time.
TThe discussion forums are not giving clear hints.
When you turn in assignment files, they cannot be opened (and we found out from an apparent student how to get past the technical issues).
What exactly is the point in the lecture then?
This course was not worth 35$.
Of all the courses I have ever taken in my BA, MA, PhD, and MBA coursework, this was the worse.
They should have a separate set of courses truly designed for beginners, and they should get help from qualified instructional designers who specialize in online adult education.
This is mostly a sales pitch for the professor's book (you're required to purchase the book for the class).
The notations are ambiguous and the quizzes are poorly designed.
i dont know why, but it's so frustrating that i have problem with this course.
I (and other learners) have found glaring gaps in the course content again and again.
I learned very little from the course.
As a professional Instructional Designer, I can attest that this is the poorest-designed course I have ever seen.
Lecturers say one word, captions show a completely different word.
First course by David Rossiter set the bar very high.
Doing this abstract Scala exercise would take me all day and I still do not understand the code nor the point of doing it!
ANYTHING GOES!
Great title of lection but their content's scarce
Learning A* and Dijkstra's algorithm is great however the assignments require you to learn not just the little details but to "discovery" techniques not even mentioned in the course material.
Peer discussion are rather superficial and do not cover half the content of the course.
Readings are OK, show good sources, but there is no real discussion about them in the videos or in the quizzes.
The explanation doesn't go as far as it should.
When material is beyond the scope of what perspective students can reasonably be expected to understand, faculty members should be honest enough to just say so rather than pretending to teach the subject matter.
I appreciate very much what the Duke faculty achieved in the first three courses, but the treatment of Bayesian statistics that I have just suffered through was shameful.
Handwavy mathematics.
Unfortunately, as often happens, what is "simple" and basic for one is not that for another.
The most useful part of this course however is the walk-through examples provided.
They don't give enough inputs and instructions to complete the assignments, unless they could offer addicional material.
Too much marketing BS, practically zero valuable information, 5 minute videos (targeted at tinder audience probably?)
establishing a valid connection to the sample data) are conspicuously absent from the guided exercises; leaving too many students to seek help from message boards and google.
Stay away!
And for easy introduction to some of the concepts Khan University courses are unmatched in accessability.
Too bad that this course doesn't match up to the above examples.
The majority of steps that needed to be taken were not taught in class or if they were, they were glossed over.
Please fix the questions, stop using Project Euler, and let people directly message code to mentors.
The course was very shallow as if teaching english literature
The peer review is a bad bad idea.
Some of this content is glaringly wrong e.
g that F Roosevelt's freedoms weren't seen by him as inalienable rights, that culture and education were attributes of Eleanor's approach to freedom that were distinctive from FDR.
Good content, awful policies intended to allow the platform to be hands-off for Coursera - that's unacceptable at this price.
Not satisfied at all.
Misleading course name/title.
Thirdly, I believe that the assessment was too easy.
There were videos missing even with deadlines approaching.
Disappointed so much of the class was spent on describing many different models instead of focusing on ones that can be applied readily.
Besides, tests are not relevant to the content taught in the video.
The point is that we are trying to gain some knowledge, not wasting time on solving those bugs.
ONly in chinese.
lack of instructions.
very bad, useless course.
After 97% of the work completed, I have to admit that this course is NOT GOOD.
Thank you anyways
Please, improve these classes in order not to disappoint the student who want to become data scientists.
Just some blah-blah and a long tutorial to install software.
After taking the Data Analysis specialization offered through Duke University I know what a capstone course should be and this course is so far from that it should be removed from the course catalog.
Too basic content.
I have not learned anything with this course (installing R and RStudio should not be part of exercises or lectures).
I hope R programming course will be better
The online builder gives very little feedback other than "BuidError".
Regards.
Go fuck yourselves
None of the concepts presented in this course would have prevented you from investing in those companies when they were beginning or in their prime.
I'm about to become a registered investment advisor.
Disappointed and DISCOURAGED!
got to pay, but besides that it's more about him talking less learning about anything
The other audited classes allow everyone to participate in everything.
That, paired with the fact that your only method to have an assignment graded is via peer review means that I'll be suggesting peers save their money on this course.
I won't recommend it to anyone and it shouldn't be part of this specialization.
If you have worked with spreadsheets before, it won't help much.
There should be some other ways of uploading the homework.
Coins and dices all the time, Brian reads to the camera.
Where is the material?
!you guys are ridiculous!
Esperanto is a perfectly valid language, fully capable of expression, and does not belong to a single / unified group.
One of the quiz is repeated.
More than 50% of my time was spent in order to learn Octave and understand (guess!!!!)
I also do not like that you get no real teacher evaluation in a capstone.
The practice quizzes and course content have no match whatsoever
I would have given this course NO stars at all if that option were available!!
Overall, intro level concepts are ok, but specifics about creation or handling of tools is left without deeper explanation
I was under the impression that this was a free service for the first year.
Looks like it's prealpha version of what it might be.
Only students have answered these forum questions.
I want to withdraw (drop) this class and take another with more clearly drawn parameters.
This course explores the Buddhist theory of suffering and liberation by comparing it to evolutionary psychological theories.
It is not a deep course on Buddhism - it lacks any substantive discussion of differences between Buddhist schools, of the difficulty of reconstructing the "historical" Buddha (a problem as difficult as reconstructing the "historical Christ"), of the fact that Buddhism as popularized in the West is actually quite different from any of the Asian forms of Buddhism, etc.
Also, evolutionary psychology is controversial in its own right - one criticism of it is that it creates "just-so" stories about the origins of mental processes that are impossible to verify (or falsify).
It is a very good topic that I am very interested and that's the reason I am enrolled , but the support and the structure of it is very disappointing!Example like this(https://www.
coursera.
org/learn/python-data-analysis/discussions/weeks/3/threads/0kwIpLJDEeawPhIF4bjuNg), question is not even specified and waste me so much time looking for the requirement and post discussion board and wait hopefully somebody is going to reply!Same for the ScimEn file , which again the file name was not specified in the question!From last secession, assignment two have lots of confusing around what exactly the question is asking about and again lots of time being wasted just to figure out the question!The support is poor as well, not like other course , I would usually get a answer within the same day , but this one is really when you are lucky!
I would not refer anyone to this course.
There was way too much jargon.
For anyone interested in bayesian stats I'd recommend reading "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis - Using R, JAGS, and STAN" and "Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers".
And I definitively not recommend this course.
This course does not seem to address any of the issues faced by a S/w Product Manager.
This course describes the view that developers are loose canons that need to be managed and that upfront planning and estimation are the right path.
this course is incredible boring.
The high video production values of this course fail to hide the abysmal lack of content.
this was more like watching an anti drug propaganda film that I couldn't finish it.
For example, they give you a line of code which goes something like:var x = new SimpleImage("...");no explanation of what SimpleImage is is given neither you are taught how exactly it works.
Overly-remedial information, but that is not what earns this course such a poor evaluation from me.
However, the lectures are very dry and boring.
The videos on this course had me so confused that I eventually gave up and went to another website to learn what I was supposed to be learning here.
There is no list of URLs for the readings available which I could find, and to take this course students are required to copy dozens of long, cumbersome web addresses from the videos.
As a consequence I had to completely rely on the www to learn the topics covered so I could do the exercises.
And you'll shrug your shoulders and say, "another waste of time."
But it's more advertisement for the book.
I don't know if this is UC Davis-specific or whether Coursera has changed significantly since the last time I took a class, but this course is totally unusable.
I would have left this review with Coursera rather than as a course review, but Coursera doesn't make contact information easy to locate.
A true disappointment.
There is a lot of variability in OSs.
It would have been much more interesting and useful to learn the why.
I don't need to be reminded how a single background vocal sounds or that we need to change panning each time we add new track.
All the assignments are so unclear and you´ve to lose so much time trying to understand the goal of the problem.
Low quality videos.
Interesting topics, but no efficient progression.
The course is poor.
the only reason to take this course is because the certification will look good on your resume.
If we are gonna pay 63$ a month of something we can at least get the proper grading system included.
This is not as good
This is the first time I am trying out on-line course.
The lessons are not very clear and have almost no examples.
:The course capstone was very disappointing.
just reading the materials
More importantly, it sucks!
Outdated
However, the final project was too difficult for what was given in the lectures.
I am not just a monkey, I have an ability to explore my software by myself, I don't need to be told how to copy and paste, and even if I need this I just go look in the manual.
I've been in the industry for twenty years and found some good information, but the quizes aren't designed for experienced adult learners.
Classmates are simply copying bits and pieces of the lecture material to make up the 'market sizing memo'.
I seriously doubt the learning value in this class, and the quality of instruction.
Coursera lost my thoughtful 2-star review so I am replacing it with this.
I cannot conscience supporting a course like this.
The lectures are short, doesn't show much details of what is expected for audit writing or analysis writing, but my 2 page analysis or audit is not enough because a thorough rubric expects to see this and that that is not even mentioned in instruction?
This course is terrible for many reasons.
This clearly not a beginner level class by any measurement.
Inconsistent course content, presenters hop between topics, complete lack of definitions, absense of content structure.
Nothing obscene, but certainly some major frustration with format, inconsistencies in scoring and format, information not reviewed in the course on some of the quizzes, the fact that Coursera keeps trying to sell me the specialty, the lack of ANY moderator on the discussion board to provide assistance...
and can go on with the technical issues to but I won't!
Students can google for tutorials by themselves.
Project: The projects mentions classes, which are not covered in the course.
Shouldn't be presented as a course that is also suitable for English speakers.
I would suggest to change the environment to be at the wide open space, like coffee shop, to make this course more attractive.
In doubt?
Too bad this is part of this spec, I wish Marco or Matthew taught this course too.
This course is not worth taking, especially if you have to pay for it!
I don't like the teacher
The assignments instructions are too vague to understand and there's no example given.
As a developer I consider this a very poor course.
A lot of this content was repeated from first two parts of this specialization.
The demonstrations of the tools were typed on a screen that was too small and the command line tools were executed so quickly that it's hard to see where the screen full of data came from.
Are there different noises made during the course of game play/"So, I can't recommend this particular course, and I'm concerned about what the capstone will look like if you give us an assignment where we're to make sense of functionality delivered as a block of text .
The course is too complicated.
I spend a lot of time (and therefore money!)
I didnt like this course.
My issue above is the reason why I gave the course a 1 out of 5.
The explanations on the practice quizzes also fail in many cases to thoroughly explain why an answer is correct.
Then there are the issues with Coursera itself, the course navigation using Chrome is quite bad.
Just listing the names of the methods and practices.
I prefer then read a book about this topic than being here at this course get bored listening at the same tone a reading of a lecture.
It's very boring to watch.
Quite disappointing experience.
This is probably the most pedagogically inept course I have ever enrolled on.
A nice idea but very poorly done.
To make it worse for me the capstone came up at the end of the year when teachers are overloaded already.
The fourth class is basically optional and it has TONS of content.
The lectures are a very brief overview of topics, with nothing actually taught.
Very disappointed with the information provided.
In particular, the student has no choice but to use Android Studio.
A lot of things are just come from the instructor's head without correcting reference from high quality literature.
there is a huge distance between what you teach in the videos, which is fine, and the programming assingments which seem to be apt at an expert audience.
to solve these problems I have to spend hours and hours on the internet looking at other people doing similar projects or asking for help.
I agree that by looking you can get insight into what you are doing, but the lessons need to be built little by little and supported by practice.
You can't slam me with these cache problems giving me an example that is hard to understand (much harder than anything seen during class) and expect me to do it in 5 hours per week.
BUT if you want to learn about Financial Markets, I would not recommend this course.
Every quiz is multiple choice, select all that apply.
Charges of $280 accumulated.
The course project in week 4 was far beyond what was covered in the lectures.
It is too basic
The information is given so quickly with terms not explained that a novice will likely not understand parts of it.
The quizzes and assignments do not match the lecture material and are contrived.
Thanks.
The quizzes usually do not concern the topic of the lessons or better, the lessons do not help in anyway to solve the problems.
We all want Coursera to go further and better, but few people prefer monopoly businessman rather than prestigious professors and diligent intellectuals.
But if you do not know anything about Autism, I think you might would contribute from it.
I think the last project was very badly positioned and explained.
A major disappointment.
This is SO out of date that half of the information is irrelevant
The test basically asked people to remember things that are not useful !
should revamp the course content and video lectures (specially the steganography part).
Please see the course as just a training sales promotion for his ML application.
Content very light, near of empty course.
Then the mentors cant even explain how to work through the problem.
They didn't explain how to use wordpress to make a website that looked more like a website than a blog.
This is a gigantic waste of time
I've done quite a few online courses over the past few years, and I consider this is without doubt the poorest.
Everything about this course was wrong, it needs to be scrapped and thrown away.
Seriously i mean after dealing with rush hour traffic and psychopath boss, I don't want to see a unhappy serious looking face throughout a course.
I personally work with an individual with AS and I excepted to have a better insight into some of the things he goes through.
Jogesh K. Muppala has very labored English and his pace and verbosity make the lectures hard to get through.
I was going to finish the course anyway, to pick up what is in there, but I just cannot stand any more plugs.
Title misleading.
Sedgewick and Wayne, this course will be a disappointment and waste of time.
I think a more practical style would be more suitable.
How am I bothered about Obama care or other american statutes?!
It should be toned down and reworked, or split into two courses.
Firstly, the course did not seem well balanced meaning that some weeks--particularly week 2--had A LOT of materials to watch and really felt like it was two weeks crammed into one, and then other weeks barely had anything.
Secondly, the exercises seemed unclear, poorly thought out and not really helpful.
I have almost no background in statistics.
I believe this is my first negative review in my 3(?)
This is a class on excel: there is NO excuse for not introducing norm.
s.
inv and norm.
s.
dist when asking that question.
The curve is far too steep to be useful or to merit the countless additional hours of background learning the course should have done to bridge the gap.
How can I know the answers?
Incidentally, the dude who does the lectures for Khan Academy does a fantastic job and the lectures are a joy to watch, though some people might prefer something that moves less slowly and carefully and perhaps they would prefer something that glosses over the fundamental concepts more.
As a teacher, I need to have realistic suggestions about the technology necessary to flip my math class, not a series of testimonials about how great it's going to be once my class is flipped.
The whole capstone is reviewed by peers which is great but as per certification I believe there should be some professional help too.
Avoid.
Cannot do the tests after modules, no reply from staff.
Not just a course to pick up for fun.
Call it Audio Slides.
I have a Master's degree in engineering and have won scholarship all my life.
This course did not motivate me at all.
This is a lousy course.
The subject and material could be interesting; however, the lectures are inanimate and the quizzes are a Rubic's cubes of sudden death with no value to assess whether you've understood the key points of the lectures!While this course was a timed release (implying someone at the U of Copenhagen is involved with it week to week, it feels as if it is an archived course with no live administration; the only interaction you seem to have is with other students.
This has got to be the worst Coursera course I have taken and I have taken quite a few.
Regrettably, I paid for the entire specialization up-front, and I cannot get a refund or even a Coursera credit for enrolling in a different specialization.
Be aware that the faculty who is the instructor of record does not participate in the course.
Although I was able to complete the course, I will now have to find an alternative source to learn from in order to really understand bayesian stats.
Video quizzes were broken more often than not.
While it is mildly interesting to learn about stochastic gradient descent, I think it would have been more interesting to have a discussion about how classifiers work in a parallelized computing environment or actually to try one out using Spark.
Finally, given that GraphLab/Dato/Turi was just acquired by Apple, I question whether it is worthwhile to take this course as ALL the materials are taught using a library that in all likelihood will cease to exist.
Lightweight and marginally informative.
Very disconcerting and not conducive to trusting what is being said.
nothing that can prepare for real interviewuseless loss of time
The first three courses in this Duke series were superbly well done.
because Week 1 materals is a imcomprehenisble mess full of incorrect explanation and vague definitions.
Also the worst part - the slides aren't posted so in order to get to these articles I had to pause the video and letter by letter type them into the address bar.
The homework is barely related to the material and one of them, the one that made me abandon wasting further time with this class consists of wasting a huge amount of time (days) configuring parameters and running an application over and over again to tune them(waiting up to ten minutes on my i7 machine to make one pass over the data).
Maybe it is also intriguing to explain everything just with one principle: the second law of thermodynamics.
if you are planning to pay to get certificate.
Does not include latest developments in this industry
In comparison I had a very good MOOC Statement of Accomplishment from the university EPFL which I can send to you if you are interested in making any improvements.
Excellent course content but very poorly designed quizzes.
The course is very superficial in nature and there is no difficulty...
Very short and just a basic overview on how to install a few tools that most of them I already had installed.
it has nothing to do with business and financial modeling, it is nothing more than a very questionable portfolio construction exercise on optimized weights and parameters.
This is nothing but a rip-off and I am shocked that an institution like U of M would allow such a sloppy, lazy product to be out there under its brand.
To make matters worse, we are instructed time & time again to go out onto the discussion board and ask for help when she doesn't want to bother explaining a concept.1.
Not learning much and constantly being bombarded with sales tactics.
This is not a course - this is a 90 minutes lecture.
The idea is greate.
Where developers are considered resources and minions that need to follow orders.
This is very frustrating, as a topic itself is one of the most interesting ones in today's software engineering.
course textbook, and some swirl exercises would have helped.
Good luck figuring those out.
The course may be great, but the sound of the video is really terrible, this is a big problem for me and possibly to other users, at the point where I decided to stop watching.
Please do something about it !
Although the information on the course states that it requires no prior programming knowledge, that statement isn't accurate.
The weekly tests are absolutely ridiculous--they ask questions requiring the application of concepts which were barely covered, concepts which were not reviewed, or which require real world knowledge which cannot be assumed for someone who has no experience in this field.
This can help to cut back on countless precious hours for those who are juggling a full-time job and retraining / career change like I am, not to mention the countless other scenarios of other learners out there.
I am neither inattentive nor lazy, and learning this content is very important to me, if it wasn't clear through my comments here already.
One last comment, for those of you who are all very sceptical let me tell you that I know that I don't have to be a statistician to grade the course contents, and I really hope the intructors are paying attention to these and similar comments from those enrolled in this specialization and the others who have completed the course.
It's like reading a bad inspirational book.
Since my local Community College used to run this course, but now points to this onine course instead, it's a huge disappointment.
Margaret Meloni was constantly looking down to read directly from a poorly-rehearsed script while trying to stumble through phrasing and lecture points.
or "To obviate the blurring effect of the atmosphere, discuss the possibility of high altitude balloon based telescopes?"
This was put together from scraps of another lecture, but in an incoherent fashion.
This course should retrieved from Coursera.
The students were tested on their ability to write down a specific phrase from a video rather than on application of the principles learned from utilization of the graph database tools.
Inaccuracies and low level of engagement.
Not clear why we need to use R and learn all this statistics.
the course is designed in a way you can not accomplished or get certificate on the proposed timeframe.
They were seldom explained in a way I could understand.
Hope this course gets upgraded
The reasons;1.)
I feel like the lectures were short summaries - not actual college level lectures.
Compare this to the "Underactuated Robotics" course on EdX.
A whole lot of talk, but not a lot of information.
I suggest that the instructor and team see how other instructors at universities are teaching their Coursera courses.
One could read from a book instead.
Very little real content or information.
Also there is less practical content for real time usage
Lectures are good, but its practically impossible to get the certificate.
I would not waste money on that course again and will probably try to get refund in time.
After reviewing all videos of week 4 twice, I quit.- Lectures often lack a continuous thread to follow.
Was able to follow instructions but did not fully understand why I was doing anything.
You may go through the threads in Help for more information and issues posted by other users.
Apart from this, it is extremely difficult to communicate with someone in Coursera regarding anything and in any form, i.
e email, live chat, etc.
Too much mathematic approach
Poor content, poor assessment quiz, and felt quite disappointed.
you have to do it on your own.
dont get me wrong.
This course is very sparse on details, and just a week of content.
Despite being someone with spoken Mandarin ability, I have decided to stop taking this course due to the new vocabulary not being explicitly described or explained in much detail.
That person should not teach.
When I have to spend a significant number of hours watching lectures on YouTube to compensate for the poor quality lectures offered in "Understand Financial Markets", I am left wondering why I enrolled in the specialization.
!Unless, the whole purpose is to make some money , then it make sense , however if it is that case , I am not going to enrol in this course any more.
Although the content is good, the course itself does not reflect in any way what a good asynchronous course should be.
Only the week 2 video on Copenhagen was actually educational beyond the most superficial concepts.
This assignment deals with functions, where the code is complicated.
I'd be curious in seeing the data on how many of your students finish this course.
Class was boring and the professor wasn't inspired nor inspiring.
It is a little sad that the materials taught were not matching test materials well in the quiz.
The course is full of all sorts of calculation errors on the graded quizes
Terrible course: (i) the lecturer seems to be "all over the place", briefly touching on several aspects of finance in a superficial way, without much coherence with respect to each week's theme; (ii) the lecturer speaks in a very confusing way, without formulating clear sentences and often divagating from the main topic with minor details that are neither necessarily relevant, nor properly explained; (iii) the few formulas that the lecturer presents are treated as if they have fallen from the sky en bloc, without explaining bit by bit how they are obtained; (iv) the main points of each lecture are not stressed sufficiently enough, leaving one to wonder what the take-home messages are at the end of each lecture.
I give the course one star due to the appreciated emphasis that the lecturer places on unorthodox economic approaches, such as behavioural economics, and on the important issue of finance democratisation.
Positive: Very interesting and informative lectures and subject matter.
Negative: Fellow "students" who have no knowledge of the subject (other than what they themselves are learning) are required to submit case studies for "peer review" by other students who have no more knowledge of the subject than they do.
It's a time waster.
Not going to take any courses from Coursera from now on.
The definition states that customer co-creation is any contribution by a customer or otherwise that helps shape the products.
Because of the purchasing issue, I am giving only one star.
Put more code in the videos and walk me through it.
Apologies each time derivatives need to be used.
Some were so loose that you could write any answer and I'm sure you'd get a mark!Also, I'd say not to even start this course unless you have a clear idea for a game.
Using 2012 statistics to describe the state of global terrorism today may be an interesting history lesson, but only serves to show how much more dangerous previously safe regions are today.
Poor lectures by one of the instructors makes it hard to listen.
Week 2 seemed okay, reasonably interesting with a video that although was somewhat dated in style managed to grab my attention for the 40 or so minutes in length.
However Week 3 is where I get off.
I dislike you paying policy.
Same because I know all this material !!!
A manual of code examples and types of jobs would have been great.
I hate being a quitter, but I was not learning statistics and causing myself many headaches and feelings of inferiority and self-doubt because I just couldn't match the quiz and exam questions to the material covered in the course.
Maybe other people are much smarter than I am, but this source was a soul and time killer for me.
I thought this course would teach art appreciation,but seems geared towards Teachers.
difficulf...
very difficult, guys
I think it was a punishing course to get through for those of us who had no background in statistics, scientific studies, or programming.
To make things worse, the assignments are rather poorly explained.
By the way, you won't get any replies from the course team - they even ignore questions about errors in lectures.
The course looks very sloppy.
I do thank the lecturers for their efforts thus far, and sincerely hope they can either improve or drop this course offering in the future.
Don't waste your money/time on this particular module.
This course is good to improve the listening skills, but the note taking is really boring, because it is focused in only one method, the Conell Note, This disregards individual differences, and I don´t think this method is the best for me.
The course moderators / instructors did a terrible job in keeping up with answering key questions that were posted in the discussion board.
corporate HR focused conflict NON resolution.
Try to be divergent just to be divergent.
The tone was a bit immature at times, and perhaps appropriate only for a grade school level classroom--not something for working professionals.
I get really frustrated when the tutor doesn't explain lots of concept/symbols in the materials.....
Nothing new and no challenging exercises.
I thought it might be beneficial to take this course but it doesn't cover anything in details.
All you did was write down what they told you to and where.
We have domesticated and bred for certain personality traits and characteristics.
In addition, the assignments bear only a tangential relationship to the lecture material.
But the lectures were too boring to keep watching.
This g
I had hoped for more :(
Did not even broach the topic until the final week (as far as I can see from the list of videos).
However, the amount of material covered is very little.
I do not see review by teachers.
I had biggest expectatives.
First assignment was tough... but do-able.
Except from week 3 material, the rest can be found on the internet and should be required by everyone who wants to take that specialization.
Then on the discussing board i see others struggling with the same things and the mentos dont help them.
Very difficult to understand and follow
The professor and instructors don't understand how to properly write SAS programs and ignored constructive feedback.
I am frustrated at myself for putting in the effort (really try) and wasted days.
Not a course for not engineering background.
The videography was totally unprofessional.
Arguments that sound very unconvincing and unscientific.
This issue must be taken seriously to make this MOOC much better.
Been asked to re-take all assignments *after* paying for a certificate!
I hope he lectures this way in the attempt of being clear.
It would be almost impossible to pick three key points they want you to learn from each video.
Please upgrade it substantially.
I still couldn't get what the correct answer is the assignment wants.
Had I taken this course without prior knowledge of the subject, without a doubt I would have quit the course after the first lesson.
The course content is presented in a very good way.
Not the expected quality
If i hadn't taken other programming classes, I would have been lost.
I had to resort to google and khan academy extensively just to grasp the concepts in this course.
I truly wanted to learn this course.
It is really shameful.
Could've learnt this on youtube - really not very good.
Bayes rule is introduced and appears in the homework but no where else.
I could gain same information with basic search engine request.
The teacher is nice and willing to give information to students.
I think that the simply reading slides doesn't help people understand.
there are side questions on the first week like does this algorithm runs in O(k * l * x^2) or O(xllogk) without ANY explanation.
The Final Exam was way too difficult compared with the knowledge provided by the lessons.
The teacher goes very fast with the concepts without really spending much time on each of them.
I really don't feel I learned anything.
The course does not allow students to take part in quizzes before paying for it.
but the quality of the course material is amazingly high and easy to follow.
Not really happy with it.
It was impossible to follow through.
Will not recommend and will never fall for it again.
most part of this course is a duplicate of the "R programming" course.
microphone/sound of the teacher quality is very bad.
not original, boring, dividing this in "4 weeks" is too ridiculously long, this should be done in 1 week to enable users to take more time for the "R programming".
this course should be free.
And you will have a lot of problems making the Assigments.
Conflicting descriptions of assessment requirements.
I took the first two Python courses and found them manageable, but this third one was an unrealistic increase in difficulty from the previous two.
I had to search a lot outside of this course to grasp something of the topics covered.
You also don't need to eat lots of Vegetables and Fruit to be a Health person just saying .
Plus this course is boring as hell
This course was extremely time consuming because a great deal of effort was required to translate it into something I could use.
for this course, nor the other courses within this specialization.
Good material, fair presentation, too many peer evaluations.
Lastly, the "professors" are completely unreachable: they may as well be dead.
My suggestion for the instructor: redo your lecture slides or point out to all of the errors in the slides.
Had I not already purchased multiple classes I don't think I would continue on.
In some assignments there were bugs in the provided code, we weren't supposed to edit.
What makes it stop?
Excellent lectures, good tests, too many peer evaluations!
Sorry maybe its my poor english.
Unable to continue this course without Upgrading.
Cramming everything into 4 weeks makes everything too difficult.
You will not learn almost anything by taking this class, as none of the topics is explained well and is the opposite of self contained.
If you didn't like the first few lectures, you won't like the rest.
While it is clearly aimed at a lay audience, a deeper presentation of the scientific foundations of the disorder is sorely needed.
I mean what is to, CC, subject or stuff like these.
It was bits of code here, bits of code there.
I do not read fast enough to keep up and understand what is bing said.
Just read the slide., The presentations add very little since the presenter is (stumbling) over just reading the text on the slides.
or so years on Coursera.
Horrible.
Quizzes kept requiring information that was oddly specific (needing an exact decimal number without multiple choice options), which would have been okay except that it was not covered in the lectures.
I've spent a bit of time going through the Specialisation (paid for one course here) and other courses online that offer Machine Learning with Python.
If you're interested, just download the online material (not videos) and read through it.
Students participation was not supported (nor required) after 1 module.
Very boring and dull presentation.
He occasionally drops a line in the discussion forum, but no direct feedback to the students.
I think this class should have a cap on enrollment so that the instructor can actually review and provide feedback to the students.
Mainly because of auto grader.
The assignments also weren't very deep or imaginative, and some of them requested very specific answers relying in keywords from the lectures rather than ensuring that the students had really understood the concepts.
The quizzes are trivial to pass.
need to change the instructor and the way the course is being taught
The sequence of the learning movie are not good and some times while teaching the the movie is ended.
Besides, rather than educational material this course refer to several website.
For example.
It's too short, I think it should be a part of a course and not a course itself.
It is a repetition of concepts and examples from other courses by john hopkins univ.
Honestly, save your money.
No one ever passes the programming assignment because it won't accept any answer.
first week takes alone about 3 weeks to complete and master
Since I was warned by the reviews, I was not even tempted to pay to unlock further pages.
No examples or explanation to the information on the slides.
This does nothing like that.
DON'T take this course if you aren't after the specialisation certificate.
How can I apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere?
All this information of this course can be self taught by Googling and the hands on exercise at the end of the course is a joke.
The assignments that are offered are optional and consist of filling in the blank code without actually providing you a way to see how your code works in the big picture.
For example - they go on and on about how intents are complicated and tricky, but they don't actually give you a required assignment.
Quizzes frequently contained questions for material to be covered in a future lesson
COME ON!
I think it would be great if you consider letting persons who audit take the quizzes otherwise what's the use - I mean i could always go on youtube and watch videos on the same topics, the difference with coursera courses is that you get the opportunity to test the knowledge gained by doing quizzes and assignment.
Boring course!
No help.
The course could use a lot more curation and direction.
The videos are long and not engaging enough.
And that is really annoying.
Also, I personally believe that it would have been much more interesting if you had not read off a screen for your lectures; try speaking off the top of your head.
The material for the first 3 weeks resemble more to someone talking about "the good ol' days" rather than a properly thought-out history class.
If I had paid for this, I would've been very unhappy.
It makes everything hard to follow for beginners and unconvincing for more advanced students.
On top of that, I feel offended by the mysogynist examples and the underlying contradictory assumptions that designers outside of agile are basically incompetent while saying at the same time that they will just use methods they already know anyway.
This class was disappointing.
They all appeared as self-promotional behavior from the professor, as if to say, "hey look how great I am making this video in Paris."
After completing the course, I had hoped to learn if any of my assignments were actually correct.
This Course is a total scam.
I think this course has very interesting information but it needs a way better format.
Way too elementary.
Dropping this specialization like a hot coal; it looked quite promising, but the aggravation over the poor organization and lack of support considerably outweighs anything I could get out of it.
It gets very discouraging by the end because you simply can't play the material.
Week 4 is better.
I feel that this course is not looked after.
The course material is really weak, did not improve my knowledge about Cyber Security.
Took test and received 78%.
Before doing things fast I need to know what I am doing!
I found no value here.
Seems bored stiff.
I learned about some great resources, but that's about it.
This concept is also missing from the course.===I reviewed this course (above) immediately after I finished it.
There have been other Cousera courses which used Octave, the free-software implementation of the programming language implemented by MATLAB.
I have seen no good reason why Octave should not have been used for this course.
Whoever is in control of quality assurance was caught napping on this one - the instructors were woeful!
The second thru the final weeks are lacking details and explanations and found myself lost during most of the videos.
extremely disappointing !
The instruction from Mr Peng is all over the place and doesn't give you a good understanding of the language.
The main reason to take this class is if you are trying to finish the entire Data Science program.
Could have been awesome course if it discussed some detailed approaches.
If you never studied course subjects, you would hardly be able to learn them through this course.
There are ideas we are all familiar with in this course.
for further study so the lectures are pretty much the only thing you get.
Honestly, this course was a waste of time.
It is just a torture listening to them!
This platform is more about money than education.
The idea was good, but the execution was not really good.
The significantly improved the quality for the second course so I assume that for a new iteration, the it will be better too.
For some reason that was avoided again and again in this course.
Great material though.
Waste of my time.
Very poorly presented course.
There are too many mistakes and misleading statements made in the course material.
First time while using Coursera I am so much unsatisfied with some course.
This course is at best serve observatory purpose to give student just a peek at what web development is like.
This course could not be used as a solid foundation fow specialization.
Not only are the professors clearly struggling with the English (and the material, calling anatomical planes "plates" and confounding sulci with fissures, etc), but some of the recording/video editing decisions make it less engaging and more difficult to follow.
No info on the starting date of the course until the end of September, when instead the course was supposed to start at the beginning of the month.
This is for people doing social work in third world countries.
I gave up after the third article and hit leave course.
Very poorly put together second module that does not prepare you to complete the assignments
If the first class or three in the series was like this I wouldn't have taken the courses.
there is a shortage of original content, although their graphics and effects department did a good job, and mostly they expect you to read outside resources.
audit the course for free to get familiar with the content but only pay if you need the certification for professional reasons.
The topic is very interesting, for me at least, but the course organization is horrible.
The content is interesting but the presentation can be improved so that audience will not fall asleep easily.
You are at the mercy of idiots doing your peer review.
I found it not very rewarding, because the discussions were hard to follow.
Buddhism conversion course.
However, they missed the mark with this one enough that I can't recommend the course.
Unfortunately I will not be completing this course only due to the fact that I have run out of time and patience to complete the last assignment.
I paid and successfully passed
Impossible to navigate to the course material.
The only reason for enrolling is to complete the data science specialization, though it may make you reconsider continuing with it.
Only vague news ... nothing substantial!
Это не курс, а набор эзотерических, бездоказательных практик, которые способен придумать для себя даже школьник.
one of the worst course ever
This course is the reason I have decided not to pursue the specialization it falls under.
Sadly, this course is NOT an Introduction to Swift Programming.
After almost a year I am still waiting to receive my grade of 90%+ for c
Presentation is so boring and dry, I could not bring myself to watching past the first couple of videos.
Very bogus and boring content.
Lacks of subtitles.
I would not recommend it.
Videos were not ellaborative, examples sparse and were not edited to completion.
I will not recommend this to others.
Great music but quizzes seem to come from footnotes to the lessons!
The questions in the exam ask mostly about year, person, numbers which is not the good exam per my perspective.
The irony of the fact that a course that was meant to teach how to appropriate evaluate adult learners was full of quizzes that were riddled with "guess what I'm thinking" short answer questions and multiple choice questions with > or < 1 correct answer was not lost on me.
If this class remains the same I wouldn't be surprised to see attendance drop in further courses and/or Coursera starts receiving complaints about the difficulty.
I was taking it for personal pleasure and it was not worth the stress each week of trying to work out what was being asked.
Not everything is explained well so very challenging for someone with no prior coding experience.
The test questions are abysmal.
Youtube videos from khan academy or Brandon Foltz (Statistics 101) are much more valuable, you really get the topic and they are free.
Being honest, the lessons in the course are disconnected with the weekly tests, specially for the final exam.
NLP is a total different thing and should be a course by itself.
This course is not maintained.
Easy but really complicate to submit the assignment.
Not only such a portfolio is pretty unrealistic, but it has nothing to do with business modeling!
ie, as soon as you become lost with the one-way taught week, no way to grasp the following weeks.
This only dealt with installing a couple of software tools.
I was not fairly graded, and I am sure of this 100%.
The gap between the lecture materials and programming assignment is enormous.
One could learn as much from any of many texts.
This is an advanced Statistics class.
Furthermore, little effort has been spent to structure the procedures that are already given.
It is ridiculous that there is NO feedback forums, and this seems to be the only course that handles it that way.
Too much reuse of old material (assignments as well as lectures).
For example, "command" sounded like "comment" and likewise was transcribed that way.
I think if a sample input was used and every field of the input were explained and also the outputs were explained then it would make much more sense.
we are at very different levels so a more gentle easing and explanation of ideas is necessary other than this apparent quantum leap from one stage to the next.
Basically this course was an excellent promotion of PwC as a consultant.
Lessons were ok but the assignments were really frustrating, not because of the questions itself but because the questions were organised badly or were really vague and confusing.
Wouldn't recommend anyone to pay for it.
Videos didn't start properly and there was no help or feedback from the instructors or the peers.
The guy just reads what is written on the slides without further explanations.
Without any discussion forum and at least a mentor this course has nothing new to offer than a You Tube video.
The amount of information gained is very thin and does not move one toward being productive.
You need a more engaging teaching plan.
A good concept, but poorly planned, poorly translated, and poorly executed.
Comparing to some other courses, think this one could really benefit if the educators could give some thought on how to teach, especially to think from a student perspective.
For example: about the capability of overwriting and defining new operators, the example given was to define a knife operator and to overload plus operator to stew vegetables.
For a beginners course I would expect more exercises about the different control structures and built-in mechanisms in Python.
Not many students to interact with because of this.
Originally, I rated this course 3-stars.
The instructor's delivery was absolutely monotone and he did not seem to emphasize the key points in any way so I found it very difficult to retain any information or to even stay awake at times.
It's like blind leading the blind.
I'll go with the minimalist style of this course and use just one word to describe it: Rubbish.
Finally, with the rapid pace of change in digital, we should not be using reading material more than two or three years old.
I looked at books too.
Bad course, a lot of talking but no explainantion.
You don't actually get an idea of how these things work or how to implement them yourself from scratch.
The quizzes are also pointless.
Terrible.
useless
This course, and the Specialization as a whole, is poorly structured and a rather cursory overview that is unlikely to satisfy serious learners.
I would only recommend this if you are just starting your PhD program and you have no idea how the writing process works
The videos were so hard to watch and the accents made it even more worse!
Cannot follow a single thing that they are talking about.
Course work was entirely optional and only started at the end of week 2.
No.
It was basically a re-hash of the previous module with slightly different tasks.
vague instructions caused more frustration than desire to continue learning.
will continue in the specialization, but will not hesitate to drop out if instruction continues like this.
very disappointed.
Avoid this course, you can learn much more from other sources.
I just can't listen to any more of this.
And what value is their feedback to me.
The course is so weak.
3 weeks out of 7 gone, and I have learnt absolutely nothing about dogs.
Well tat doesn't sound like much of an honor code to me.
I was expecting to have more technical material and lessons.
Crippleware if you don't
Review the course or better close it.
The instructor is VERY bad at presenting.
Furkan
I was really disappointed with this, especially since its a cool topic that could easily be presented in a very exciting way.
Sorry, but the course is very poor.
The first few weeks are truly beginner/intro course stuff and the entire course is well taught.
Take $64 from my account without telling me clearly amongst all the other junk mail.
Professors need to undergo a presentation and Instruction Design skills.
The course, and indeed the whole specialization, was advertised as not requiring the Graphlab Create toolkit.
I feel like I know even less if that was possible after just the first few weeks!!
did not learn anything useful at all.
I'm completely shocked and disappointed.
In other words:It is a complete joke and a sad excuse for a MOOC.
No design no learning experience.
Assignment instructions and grading criteria are badly misaligned, which is probably why there is such a big backlog of old assignments from earlier sessions.
The person responsible for the course should take the following actions:1) Aligning the grading criteria with the assignment instructions2) Clearing out the backlog of assignments that have not yet been peer reviewed.
Totally not worth having the certificates.
Easy assignments.
Good for people who never programmed before.
Can you please forward this review to the right person?
I cannot recommend this course in its current state.
A supplemental video for those would be great even of optional.
Brian Cato is a good presenter, however, more examples needed to be done showing how to work out various statistical problems both by traditional method and using R.
Examination is based on literal terms (e.
g: what year was XX reform enacted").
I have no idea why you called it course, since there was nothing inside.
And last thing about this course that tutors commit an gross error during lecture.
I think that first course of this specialization was pretty great and this one is disappointing.
There is no instruction with this course.
Been playing music for over 30 years and am failing from week 4 on.
If I could rate this ZERO I would.
I can pass the course all because I have some background of this topic.
Not recommended at all.
Some content is good and informative but there's a big problem with the teacher accent (adding a "ch" at the end of half the words) and his diction (hesitating on the other half the words).
Some wrong solutions were provided for assigments but were never addressed or acknowledged that it will be fixed.
Bad sound quality
It's a course which is designed to preview the other courses.
if i've never written a script, what value am I to someone else who has also never written a script.
only thing i remember is the instructor's face after finish this class.
Instead, it even says "non-credit course".
The teacher is only reading the slides which makes the experience quite limited/boring.
The content is enough to get an idea of Bootstrap basic functionality.
Superficial treatment of the subject matter.
Unfortunately the course is not very well thought out.
Disappointed by the course content ( except for the 4th week).
The course content is US specific which has no relevance for international students.
Ended up not being able to take the rest of the courses I paid for because Coursera kept pushing it back... Start date after start date moved ....
Was disappointed with this course.
I truly hope that this isn't the direction that Coursera is headed in, as this class seems more like a cheap self-help seminar than an academic course of study.
If what you want is the sort of doctrinaire overview of fine-art photography that you might have learned in a university in the 1970s, this is exactly the course for you!It's thoroughly saturated with the Museum of Modern Art mindset: the assumptions and interpretations are those touted by MoMA curators, and the photographers are chosen from the MoMA-approved pantheon.
as for the majority of those who use coursera to self-educate it would probably seem a bit too much of stating the obvious.
Not explained well, had to take another statistical inference course.
My peer-review assignment for week 1 was done the first week was never peered, reviewed, or peer-reviewed.
I have some IT background and was able to share my homework through my shared drive fortunately.3) The speaker should re-record his lecture.
It is really hard to grasp the information when it has simply been read to you!
This is a good course for deciding if you want to pursue a more advanced degree in Cryptography, Computer Science, or Mathematics, but As part of a Cyber Security specialization, your paying customers are most likely working professional engineers or programmers, interested in practical applications of cryptography that they can use in order to create secure systems and services.
This is like going through a manual or series of instructions.
its not there...
On several occasions, inline quizzes test you on concepts that haven't been introduced until later in the video, forcing you to guess at answers.
Finally, many of the test questions themselves are irrelevant to the content of the course.
I did not complete it, because it was really not worth spending time on.
I was floored by how the class went form simple to extremely complicated with no transition phase.
Explaining what an email is, and how to send attachments is completely irrelevant information.
The title of the course should be more appropriate - Introduction to email, what is it and how to use it.
The lectures are just videos of the professor bloviating about Jefferson.
Most of all, the presenter's style was distracting.
But without enough mathematics nothing she said makes sense.
So, none of the code you write in this course will ever be able to be used anywhere else.
A good example is the Coursera "The Global Financial Crisis", which I am also doing currently.
d.
The Assignment questions are unclear due to which a lot of time has to be invested.
So not only did I not feel like I was doing the work correctly, I can't get feedback, and the lecturer doesn't break down the rationale behind the assignment, and how he would have done it or why.
1)the course is very abstract and is looks more like an obvious advertisement.
Very very bad communication from the teachers.
Since everything depends on the IDE, and there was no instruction about the IDE, I found it difficult to do the labs.
The lectures for this class are incredibly weak.
Nothing practical
But the lab/programming were pretty terrible.
They instructor really break down the syntax of the code and just left the student to figure it out.
Similar to other courses in this specialization, the material is very nice (although slightly easy and straightforward), but the course instructors do not moderate the discussions enough to make them a useful tool.
I payed 315euro for this course.
Remember there are tons of free resources on the internet, and this only undermines your strengths.
All you are really doing is 'filling in the blank'.
Not much useful.
It is very basic and the principles are for a third-grader.
The course structure is a bit messy and the content is quite technical.
Much of the content is unclear and there is little depth.
What a huge underestimate!
I am not able to create application for mobile phone after finishing it.
First 4 modules were somehow useful but since module 5 onward it is just waste of time, I did not learn anything useful, I did not learn how to code.
Check out John Cochrane's Asset Pricing 1 and 2 or Tim Roughgarden's Algo 1 and 2 for great examples of thoughtful problem sets and intuitive derivations.
I don't normally, in fact ever, leave bad reviews, I usually just chalk it up to experience and move on but in this case, the course was so bad, I had to say something.
The instructor also speaks to fast.
this is something that can prove 'costly' when doing the quizzes I failed all the questions of all the quizzes for all the attempts I tried.
I felt more like I was part of some experiment to see how long I could tolerate boredom than that I was in class where someone was trying to share knowledge with me.
Boring voice.
This course is based on personal anecdotes and not facts.
Too simplistic, doesn't worth your time.
And I struggle to understand how performing this exercise prepares me for real-world Scala programming either.
SO WHY DID I PAY FOR THIS CLASS?
Withdrawing the Honor Code Certification is so unethical.
Course content is not substantiated with research.
I also found the lectures to be not very helpful.
This is not meant for rank beginners.
I do not recommend this course (and as a matter of fact, the entire specialization) to anyone.
There were no structure.
There have been no TAs to help answer questions or to rectify these wrong answers.
Don't be fooled by how detailed and clear the first weeks videos are.
The first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures, the textbook, or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignment/quiz.
Absolutely useless.
No instructor participates in discussion.
Course 3, however, introduces a variety of computer science topics that I believe cause information overload for a beginner.
Waste of money.....
Quizzes were interesting, but time-consuming because of the necessary extra research outside of provided lectures.
0/10
The language is so slow that it is terribly difficult to make sense of each sentence.
The content barely scratches the surface and there is neither a forum, nor an exchange with other learners.
Extremely generic and a but to much of self-promotion.
But again, the truth doesn't fit in their world view.
Furthermore they "teach" that cities get blown away by taifoons is caused by the "universe balancing entropy".
Transcripts of the lectures in unformatted text files and a glossary are available for download.
It would be far more profitable to simply study an appropriate textbook or online course notes.
If they don't review it, don't bother paying for it.
It was a very conceptual look at cyber conflicts that you could get if you paid attention to the news over the last five years.
Could not get to the fourth course and was asked to pay for it twice.
However, it takes thinking, planning, and dedication.
Unfortunately, I did the free trial and Coursera didn't process my cancellation so that I had to pay for a whole month for this.
Complete waste of time AND(!!!)
Hated the course and the content.
If you teach me how to be a builder ask me for a wall, not a bridge.
The Lecturers are very enthusiastic, but I was hoping for examples and assignments based on Pandas and Skikit-Learn.
I just gave up after less than an hour and went and played with WordPress myself.
Created a website in 2 days, but with no help from this course.
What does the instructor think???
I even tried to speak to someone over the phone but there was no number available.
However, the solutions were presented as if: 1.)
The content taught in this course is not in accordance with the assignments.
By the time I got into the subject the refund policy was expired.
Auditing is pretty useless with how this class is updated.
It's like they forgot the part about "problem solving".
The assignments are to eat foods you've never eaten, talk to people you wouldn't normally talk to, take a photo of yourself smooching someone/something, and to "give" something to someone you "never have given anything before".
One of the assignments was about an app that no longer exists.
The lectures were hard to follow on many levels:1) The enunciation was unclear and subtitles were often of-the-point, plus they covered-up the code lines that were being discussed.2) The lecturer often failed to explain logical constructs that were being used, despite the fact that the course should have been understandable with no R cran/Bioconductor experience.3) The method arguments were either not explained, or very vaguely mentioned, which means applying them to new situations was unnecessarily complicated.4) No feedback at all was offered from course organisers/reps to anyone, even after complains in discussion forum about quiz questions.5) No feedback for solving the questions/correct answers even after the deadline.6) Quiz questions required methods and logical constructs that were not explained/used/mentioned in the lectures.
Things mentioned by the instructors are naive.
I gave it 2 stars for two reasons.1) The videos are deceptively short.
I was expecting to learn more in this subject as described on the course info.
I just do not see the point of creating code that can add and subtract numbers without using number types!!!
So much of lecture seem to be on the history and theoretical of R programming that it completely fails to cover the material needed to actually completed the programming assignments.
I am about to drop this class.
Less useful than reading an introductory chapter.
The use of slides that are not clear / too small and not on the screen long enough to digest the information did not help.
Its a shame.
Very knowledgeable professors, but very little explanation or actual 'teaching'.
It absolutely amazing course , I personally benefit a lot.
Personal difficulty in understanding accents, my own lack of ability.
This one should be taken off coursera.
very basic.
I spent most of my time researching other sources for information because the lectures, and the supplemental information given on a different site, by the instructor (which indicate knowledge that the lectures are insufficient) give trivial examples when the programming assignments are anything but.
i find Hard to keep up with him.
Run all videos set first, then consider digging into practice.
I took a book and learned more form it than this video.
i passed the tests without going over the material.
This course is too short and have little real time example .
John Hopkins should be embarrassed that their name is associated with the pedagogical malpractice that is this specialization series.
Foolishly, I paid for the entire specialization up front and Coursera refuses to refund me for the remaining two courses.
I find it unstructured and rather poorly presented.
Personally, I feel that the way of sharing and teaching was assuming everyone is an expert in this subject.
Again, nothing of value was added, and quickly going over the FAQ page of any of the products mentioned would be more helpful, faster and a lot more interesting.
This entire course needs a serious revamp.
If I had wanted to spend hours in google trying to learn this stuff I would not have spent money on this course.
The teacher gives you all inforation without normal explan.
In this case, I wish they were more honest with the times by actually typing the code in real time while teaching.
I'm sorry, but it completely failed my expectations.
In this respect they are so dangerous.
Starting it now.
Nothing of substance but lists.
From the grading you got no information what was wrong or which tests passed or failed.
The assignments are brutal which encourages cheating.
Even too basic for an introductory course.
Overall, I felt let down by the lack of materials and assignments (no hand-on experience can be gained, no peer -graded assignments).
No enough illustration for the content of the course.
That way anyone can follow his problem solving methods and benefit from the course.
I had to take other online courses on Code School and Pluralsight just to understand what's going on, and later come back to finish the homework.
In the end I don't think it was any better than any of the free online tutorials out there.
Also it isnt well explained!
I wrote 350 words persona, with stories and demographic of my target audience.
What is the reason to put together so much details about network packet headers and all other parts of this course?
Alluring student by the name of UCI and giving the students the worst is hypocrisy.
As a side note - I have taken in excess of 25 online courses, this was the most painful.
ridiculous , unscientific 'self-helpie", far below of even talk-show standards.
Also, I really didn't like the fact that the course is centered on caret, a "shortcut" package to do stuff fast.
It's flat out exploitative to throw students at an AWS assignment without updated instructions and with outdated versions of pig scripts, etc.
I wish this course would skim over conjugate prior methods and then focus on MCMC sampling methods by teaching how to build interesting and practically useful models using JAGS/STAN/PyMC/whatever.
I was not aible to complete this course for free.
Examples: PPP valuation has not been part of lectures, but is referred to.
It's so hard to understand and focus on what she's saying.
Module Quizzes questions and answers were vague and poorly constructed resulting in choosing incorrect answers.
Reading material was of poor quality with many "industry professionals" not being professional enough to perform a simple spelling and grammar check.
Anyway, I did it because there was also no help from any TA to guide me in the right direction.
Long story short, you are way better off checking the syllabus of this course and checking videos on youtube to learn about them, you'll learn way more than with this money grabber course.
in week 2, a very simple for loop in week 3, and "implement gradient descent" in week 4.
IMO way too much time and energy is wasted on history, name-dropping and dry mathematical backrounds.
She does not have enough people to review the written assignment and the assignments go UN-reviewed leading to a 'no-grade' whihc is ridiculous.
In addition to that, lots of the lectures were too long and sometimes even meaningless.
Good instructional design would mean that the professor should show all the tools one could use to faithfully complete and achieve the assignment.
Once again greed takes precedence.
I really wanted to learn this stuff.
elementary school level program, not college or university
This course is more about how programming, then teaching about programming in python.
One week of this course was only marginally relevant to the subject.
The monotonous voice gets me!
Nothing new in the lectures.
If it was not a part of the Specialization I would never follow that course, neither the other one taught by the same professor.
This happened not just in course assignments but sometimes even in mid-roll video-overlaid quizzes where the answer was something not explained or taught or shown.
What should have taken 45 minutes took nearly two hours because of the load times for datasets.
I'm a 15 year senior level accounting executive and I was easily spending 10 to 15 hours a week plus watching the videos 3 or 4 times each in order to understand the content.
I found the course was very confusing and the language used in the quizzes and exams didn't always match the language used in the lessons making it very difficult to understand what was wanted.
For a non-specialist, statistics is almost always a struggle, intently making it more difficult by trying to use trick questions and application in the quizzes and exam beyond what was covered in the course makes it really really difficult for those of us who are naturals at math.
I worked really hard in the course and finally made it thought all 6 weeks of the course but after one try at the final exam I said to myself enough is enough.
get use to this: "A moderator deleted your post in Calculus One because of spam""Review our forum Code of Conduct to learn more about guidelines for participating in course discussions", but i and others are only posting problem areas, thus rendering the forum discussions uselesssince the moderators only have the power to delete and edit your post, there is a list of content errors for the course that you will need to look at.
The methodology is not very precise and I could think in a few enhancements.
Still, I could recommend for those who want just a initial contact with the method.
But nothing useful to be learned in here.
The assignments were awful, in some cases they covered material to be presented the following week, in others the questions were wrongly stated and did not match the output from the machine grading.
It's just introduction and should be condensed to one video and a handout with pointers to those who need more specific and detailed instructions for setting up their computers.
No value add over a textbook.
"I must mention that other lecturer is much more coherent, and that he talks sensibly through various cases, actually demonstrating how precedent works.
?This is a lazily designed course with poor content and almost zero guidance.
There are no worked examples or annotated slides.
No where did I ever see anything that said ahead you had to pay -- if you didn't want a certificate or to do the whole specialization.
Further, the course seems more of a commercial for the University of Virginia than anything else.
Very wordy and diffuse.
I did not want to write in the forums after my initial foray in the forum led one mentor to just tell me "your logic is wrong", and the spout the same simple strategies of the lecture that could not help on the complex assignment.
There probably will not be anything fixed with this course since it seems like it has been the same for years now.
That's terrible!
The course is extremely short and vague.
I have a negative opinion of the structure of this course.
Not professional at all!
just learned programming from kahn academy and the teacher was excited to teach.
In the test of Lesson 7 we are asked if removing jargon from an analysis makes the analysis clearer.
Quite disappointing.
The EEPROM project in week 3 is undoable with the specified simulator, as the simulator is simply not functional.
Sadly I got very disappointed.
.
In week one, we learned some basics.
Way too many weekly lectures, way too many.
bad for the projects
Week four contains a 15 minutes video on image processing, that's basically it for the week.
Follow-up readings for week two just provide a link to Apple's iOS Developer site.
3.
Not a very interesting class, only learned some vocabulary and some pre made sentences, but no general structure or grammar.
Way too basic for the price - almost no content - this is just setup - I resent paying for setup instructions.
They're disorganized and I'm struggling to see how the material correlates.
It was very difficult to iuinderstand and I did not think it was a "beginner's course for no
The transcripts are full of mistakes.
I did not really feel like a free course .... too
However, it takes more time utilising these methods of planning, checking the plans, planning extra work and risks than actually do the work.
It is impossible to multitask, let's go back to monotask.
I'm pretty much always turned off when a course won't let those who are auditing the course (i.
e.
Very slow.
I doubt that inexperienced in research beginners will provide valuable feedback - at least I would never do it if I hadn't been quite experienced in that.
Purely academic and dull as dishwater.
One can go on and on ....
Total disaster.
I would venture to make some suggestions:a.
Their helpful hints cause errors when used mainly because you must know the correct syntax or placement of the code to get the correct answer.
I'm very disappointed in this class and probably will not pass because I do not have the time to figure out how to program in R.
What a bunch of ridiculous crap.
Clearly, I should have known more about finances before taking this class, and perhaps I would have liked it more.
This course is bad!I had come upto week 4.
Quiz should be open to all students... :/
There is no courtesy to a student/customer who has paid for the course.
But guess what I says 14 days have passed so I cannot get refund!!!!
I put the playback rate at X 1,50 in order to be able to understand her.2) She is just making a summary in bullets of the readings that we are supposed to read anyway.
So, someone might give you a 1 for submitting the PDF and thus you wouldn't get a full-score.
She is not involved and does not serve to inspect the work of the students to ascertain that a grade is in order.
Too complex all the course
All the rest is vain.
He was also obsessed with bragging about all of his accomplishments.
I'm the lucky one in that I was able to finish the course.
A string of interesting ideas, with unclear explanations.
The vast majority of the course is dedicated to short writing tasks that are supposed to get you engaged (i.
e.
The material is very limited and the coverage has to be more lively with some some relevant examples.
Drink everytime the lecturer said "Google" without reason.
( See per example Agile from Darden to benchmark).
Not clear illustration， many problems are not directly related to the content covered.
In my opinion, if the lecturer respects students and his field of study, he does not READ from the script and lack motivation...
That's not good point for the prestigious University of Toronto and Coursera.
Videos give zero context for why data structures are important or when they are used....
Should take a lesson from the Stanford course.
Be prepared to do your own research for the extra study materials.
sorry!
Low on actionable content.
i have had to do a different course else where and i am getting the sort of good introduction into the R language, its not practical to expect everyone to understand the ideas in 4 weeks.
programming is hard enough as it is.
The lecturer is not the best at explaining concepts.
Information overflow and poorly delivered lectures where the instructor is just reading from slides.
It's a long content dump with just two peer-reviewed assignments.
Answers to week 2 are wrong, no forum to discuss it, submitted a case over a month ago - still no reply.
Such a boring class
More work should be put into the making of the lecture videos by the school to give it a realistic classroom experience.
Unfortunately I dropped out of the MOOC because of the poor quality done by the school despite it being a topic of interest for me.
Furthermore the material is REALLY dry and theoretical, lacking pragmatic problem solving.
It seems to me that the teacher didn't make enough preparations and make a lot of mistakes during the couse.
This course has nothing to do with Excel.
The examples are rarely connected to something real, numbers come up from ... nowhere.
Def a useful skills to have when starting to interview for jobs.
This is more about learning how to create art in general, not exactly what I'm looking for.
Hopefully "Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark" from the "École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne" (also from Coursera) is good (I know their Scala courses, which are taught by Martin Odersky, are quite good).
There are very few quizzes between lectures and the assignments are not very challenging.
Many of the videos, specially the ones at the end were extremely rushed over.
If I had paid for it, I would have asked for a refund.
Period.
The course is almost about nothing.
I hope those who take it think critically about the subject matter and do their best to weed out what is reasonable and what is not.
I managed to complete this course, but that was because of my four years of "MOOC-level" "programming experience" and duckduckgo (~google), not because of the course material.
(so far)
Although this course is admittedly an introduction to UX, it is still very underwhelming.
I didn't learn anything new.
This course is structured around a specific and costly Python library called Dato.
It was too slow
The teaching process is very elusive and subtle.
No systematic approach was ever described for performing this task.
The quiz feedbacks are empty, this is not good.
You're probably better off just reading some of the official documentation online.
Course assessments seem to test in-depth knowledge of coding in R (which isn't gone over in sufficient detail in lectures, rather students are told to look it up in more detail on their own; however, the class is already longer and more in-depth than all the others in the specialization!)
well taught but not what I thought it would be.
The graded assignments are just a regurgitation of the lectures and so don't require you to take a deeper dive into the material.
Assighnment is partly possible only with classmate who has full knowledge of python!
Easiest accounting common sense.
Can't believe that such a course is offered here and that I really paid for nothing of such quality.
This course is definitively perfect for the ones who know nothing about Infographics and they might enjoy it.
The course focuses more on the theoretical side with no practical examples.
When I contacted coursera.
org they had no clue when it is going to start.
!too much emphasis on mathematical notations....
where are the practical applications?lack of examples....
it seemed more of a prose than a lecture....
would not recommend to a beginner.
Period
Have the lady call 1800 Web .
This course is very difficult to follow, not because the topics are hard or too technical but mostly due to lecturer's poor job in explaining and creating a narrative.
The reason I say this is because the same concepts are reviewed and explained in lot more fun, creative, and interactive manner at other free of cost resources like Khan academy, youTube channels, etc2) Who is the audience?
I was helping other students understand the assignments, and spent extra time grading submissions as no teaching assistants were available to help.
There were a couple of very good teachers in the specialization, however the structure is critically flawed and your time would be better spent studying on your own.
Avoid not just the capstone, but this entire series.
If this is the best online Princeton can do, count me out.
The framework wasn't updated for Swift 3.
I ended up spending way to much on AWS even though I managed it the best I could Terminating instances.
That could be redeemed by good explanations you may say but sadly it´s not the case most of the time.
I'd like to give just one star rating for this course, as it is very far from what I expected.
I know nothing about bioinformatics, or NGS (which is why I took and paid for this stupid course) so I spent WEEKS on the final assignment and I STILL could not finish or pass the course.
Had to go to YouTube to figure out most of it.
The instructors sounded like robots and you could tell easily that they were just reading from a script.
Not enough material to understand the concepts.
Perhaps, in the feature more time can be devoted to make this course better and I can spend more time learning how the algorithms and maths work rather than matlab and the automatic grader.
Very bad experience.
Wont take Coursera classes again for certificate.
Kindly solve my problem.
This class is a joke and not worth $80.
If this an institutional decision to not have feedback, it seems that these instructors and/or the University of California, Irvine do not care to help students.
I expected something more articulated and not so elementary
They discuss them a bit, but they never really give you a bigger picture or really how all the concepts you've learned fit together.
Poor quality videos make the course less appealing and make it seems to be unprofessional
very boring
I am leaving this course and unlikely to sign up any MOOC from the same team again.
Only saying what it does.
Reading almost only his slide without further information.
No basic formulas such as eg.
I also think it's a bit suspect for a prof to be plugging his own book for one of these courses.
I enrolled weeks ago and I found that the system has kicked me out the course.
You need to be prepared for wasting a lot of time for programming assignments -- it's not because the assignments are tough but because of poor descriptions and out of sync with lectures.
It is too much based on powerpoint presentation and not at all on example.
There's no way to get help in this course.
Peer-review for this course is not a good idea as well, given abstract concepts and different language.
Doesn't worth it at all.
I'm not sure if this is coursera's fault or rutgers' but i don't think i will take ever another course (paying) here in coursera with these kind of calculation quizzes, it's a waste of time.
I can't imagine how a mathematical or programming course must be with this poor approach of assessing the results.
They say that if you don't have anything good to say it's better not to say anything at all.
The videos are long but not teaching many things.
This should improve so that student who has less/weak knowledge of Math can pass the quiz.
Very poorly structured.
The course was horrendously boring, and so far removed from the interesting and interactive work that we had done in the previous sections of the Specialisation.
One star for the review is too much, no preparation, lack of security, bad quality.
I signed up for this course hoping for a good introduction to OO programming and Java only to not be able to verify if I have even learned anything.
Mr. Onuf spends the majority of these lectures implying what Jefferson thinks without discussing much in the way of actual history.
Didn't think that this is the best course for people who want to learn about Digital Marketing.
Week 3 was a big leap to JavaScript, and the level of difficulty was the reason why I quit the course.
Too difficult for me.
I felt sorry for the students who actually attained this class at Yale campus.
It seems that the instructor just reads the slides without reasoning and explanation.
During lessons you don`t receive enough information to be able to pass the exams
Looking at differences between pictures with a girl and pictures with a boy is really abominable and shows an intentional discrimination and racism.
$79 at a time....
Be warned and don't pay for this course!I really don't get why this course has so many good reviews.
Whoever allows this course to still exist and waste people's time and take their money should be ASHAMED of themselves.
The peer reviewers were not always fair, in my opinion.
The quality of the presentation is very low, and way below the quality in other courses.
Sorry, but this was a major letdown to myself and two other colleagues who all signed up to take it together.
Joke's on anyone paying $49 to essentially teach yourself.
I was really disappointed in this "course" for several reasons.
I'm sorry, it is not what I expected.
autograder will not accept my valid code that contains all valid elements, will not make the deadline so will not bother continuing.
So, I decided to end the nightmare, and I'm glad it's over!
Not good at all.
We see different processes without anyone making clear the reason why we should apply this processes ,under which conditions and what is the question that we have to answer when we apply these processes.
The only good is that we get into some new terms and see new things.
I could say that for me,it wouldn't make such a difference if it wasn't in this specialization.
just some basic knowledge, most of the knowledge is not expanded or deep introduced.
probably a very interesting course, but the way of teaching looks very indigestible... no video and no real explanation or examples.
It is so basic and simple.
was not as good as previous courses in this specialisation
The false comparison between religion and soul beliefs cloud the validity of the course.
Worst bunch of talking a lot and saying nothing I ever encountered.
too hard to follow
I slogged through it and got an 89, but the videos were boring and the quizzes were poorly worded and should have had greater correlation with the course content.
She then closed my question and I could not respond or ask for more details.
If I had it to do over again I would invest my time and money somewhere else.
I have taken good courses on line before, but this is not one of them.
It seems that the Dr. Tucker Balch and/or the moderators have totally abandoned this course, but Coursera keeps offering it and collecting money.
The neither instructor or nor the moderators have posted on the Meet and Greet Forum.
The instructor and/or moderators have ANSWERED NO QUESTIONS posted on ANY forum.
The QSTK (software) BUGS have NOT BEEN ADDRESSED by the instructor or the moderators.
The designers do not seem to understand properly what science is and what scientists do.
I have to score it just for me to check the other student's work.
I suggest to add more materials, or merge with other courses.
At no point during the course was any of the MATLAB's strengths -- like easy solving of linear systems or vectorized operations, even suggested upon.
Furthermore, the course has unhealthy interest in dates and calendars - again of course disabling all the built in tools.
Be prepared to make countless online searches or to discuss solely with peers.
Needs to be cut down to about one tenth the presentation time.
I feel like an idiot for paying for it.
the essay's topics rarely correspond with the actual reading of the book.
Just AWFUL....
The teachers do a poor job of explaining basic concepts and theories.
If I'm talking to technical people who knows a lot about the topic jargon can be useful, on the other hand if jargon is not documented it can be confusing.
How are we supposed to know this?This is just one example, but all the courses of the EDS specialisation had these issues.
If I answer "no" once, please leave me alone!
This was an extremely elementary and thus disappointing course.
Discussing SWOT analysis is a strategic concern, and as a PR related course we should see more related to marketing and communication techniques as a result of the search.
The instructor rambled on when back on forth on topics and numbers too much and made the videos much longer than they needed to be.
This course was a extremely introductory course in excel.
There is nothing academic about this course.
There's no support from the staff.
Too much time spent writing things on slides that should have already been on the slides.
As of this review: no reviews on the last courses in the series, and some poor (but indicative) reviews of the other courses.
Especially when the answers are just wrong.
The staff/teachers/instructors CAN BE A LOT MORE INVOLVED ON THE FORUM!
This course assumes that you are familiar with freeRTOS.
The programming assignments are only doable because most of the work has been done by the people designing the assignments.
The worst course I've ever taken.
Bad sound quality, dead discussion forums, not possible to understand material without external (not mentioned in the course) sources.
There is no doubt that coursera platform is the best education in the worldBut I want to learn digital marketing and this Capstone needs to experience in the digital marketing not less than 10 yearsI wish there are a path or templates to work and learn, such as the Capstone project of specialization in marketing social mediaThere is lack of information and data and the previous five courses is insufficient for professional project like this CapstoneThe first course marketing in the digital world was really the best course in courseraand This course is really the worst course in courseraAnd unhelpful and I did not learn anything from this course only gather information from various sources to pass assignment
This course proved to be a waste of time.
Unfortunately, that is exactly what they attempted to do for grading Final Projects.
Unless you are ready to suffer through several hours of tearing your hair out because their parser does not accept perfectly written code, don't take this course.
It was particularly frustrating to have legal references mis-spelled (e.

It was not w
if you're making a video - make it worth actually WATCHING.
I'm not able to submit my assignments
very bad and not organised
There is a lot of material in this course that has not been explained
Do not bother to think, just repeat, because that's what necessary.
I struggled to finish this course only because of the whole specialization and a great job which has been done by all the other professors.
The volume of analysis they suggest is overwhelming and impossible for the average investor, and when all is said and done, worthless.
Coursera gives no refunds for a 5-course specialization if you have completed the first course.
Mechanics is not listed as a prerequisite but it should be.
There was basically nothing in it.
But every time?The assignment is a miss - students should be given a choice whether they want to focus on marketing their professional personas or marketing their business.
I can summarize MOOC 1 in one sentence.
Annoying was the overuse of colours in almost every video (almost everything was coloured - highlighting everything is just as usefull as highlighting nothing, green box with white text inside - did you try to read that on a different monitor than yours?
You're kicking this off in R-studio and teaching the whole course from this interface?
By far to expansive for what you get.
I believe a better design of the project could lead to a more efficient, less frustrating learning experience.
In the future you have not got anything to show in your CV.
I want my Statement of Accomplishment.
If you are like me and did this kind of math back in the 70's and 80's but have not used it since, be prepared to seek sources outside Coursera in order to understand the material and pass the quizzes.
minutes.
If I did not constantly monitor what part of a course I should be in versus what part of the course automatically loaded next, I often found myself taking a quiz for which no lectures had been presented.
the whole course seems disjointed.
would have been much more effective as learning through examples and to be taught functions and definitions as they come up in problem solving.
This course was way too basic.
It's optional.
There are too many presumptions presented as 'facts', though, and too much certainty about research issues that lots of debate is still going around.
Poorly designed course which tests people on things that are not taught.
Personally, I, like many other mates, am really grateful to Coursera for offering everyone this equal opportunity.
Quizzes on concepts not covered in the material.
Don't just read slides to me, I can do that myself.
Very dissapointing.
Content is very basic.
Maybe if I get inspired later, I will try again.
It was necessary to use a collection of outside material from other courses and readings to learn the concepts.
But the worst were the quizzs.
The additional lectures by guest website designers were the most interesting part, but they were supposed to be after the final project.
I am withdrawing from the class.
But since everything else is written, you can not run the code as you write it to check your work.
There are far better courses out there for much cheaper prices.
Also, not being able to take the quizzes makes the course meaningless.
Just because something is free, it doesn't give free reign to be lazy.
I was planning on taking additional courses through the Coursera platform, but now I am reconsidering.
This would be cool topic to learn about but it is just so poorly executed.
Week 1 was just introduction.
It was painful to work through the videos at first place, for more than one reasons.
I had a feeling like I was watching professors from school for disabled, and not an university.
The whole time of lectures 10-15 minutes
If you are really looking to learn about IoT, check out a course called " An introduction to programming IoT" by University of California, Irvine.
Someone should have proof read this course.
That is so disturbing.
most of it you can't do unless you pay for it.
I signed up for a neuro course, not an advertisement of the campus.
The last peer review is really hard to do.
This course is not well-presented.
As usually Johns Hopkins offers very disappointing courses because of their boring lectures and senseless quizzes.
This course as it is should not be in Coursera.
Stack overflow and 2 hours would do a better job.
Investment Managers) tend to overperform and that you should have one manager.
There's even the overall 1st part of Module 4 that is dedicated on how to select a manager...
There are some great insight related to portfolio allocation but not much explanations.
Hi,I'm sorry to say that this course wasn't really useful.
Instead of using the questions to delve deeper into the topic at hand, they only create confusion with futilities.
I don't feel that I learned a lot from this course.
UPenn has let me down twice.
Despite lots of good information, there is no effort to present it in an interesting and engaging way.
It's really frustrating because he will just skip steps, and because he doesn't explain WHY he's doing something, if you miss a step, you get completely lost.
Three weeks in, and I can't really articulate what I've actually learned (which leads me to believe that the answer is "not very much").
The course by David was awesome.
This course offer a lot of interesting topics, but the way of their presentation is not very amazing, so the student loses easily the concentration.
Practical tips are few, and neuroscience is not the title of the course, but is widely discussed.
Anyway, this is just my two cents.
Pretty bad as far as I am conerned.
Bootstrapping is not a new idea and has been used in other fields.
Lectures are in Hebrew.
Many of the assignment instructions and questions were poorly written, and students clearly had trouble understanding what was asked of them.
In that contest what are the quizzes, what should quizzes have to test if no content is given?Moreover it often happen that without a clear support from the lectures, questions are confused and ambiguous.
This is very basics hence getting a certificate is not valuable.
The material is very unclear.
If you miss a single piece of information, you can't complete it due to a 4-out-of-8 selection question every week which you HAVE to answer correctly.
).
It is not a course.
Nothing to learn here.
He didn't do any of them which means he either doesn't know how to teach or this specialization is a complete scam.4.)
In addition, people who work with software development should expect to look further if they aim to add to their toolbox.
This is not really a class, but rather a project on a topic NEVER covered in any of the previous classes in this specialization.
I would like to see more tutorial.
This is no real need for this course.
Instructor's presentation style borders on condescending.
I reached out for help on the discussion board a number of times and saw many others were struggling as well.
Explanations not clear and feels like he's reading rather than explaining things.
Consecutive videos feel like they are disconnected.
Seems out of place with the rest of the specialization in terms of both length and subject matter.
Plus there is not really enough chance for repetitions in the videos.
in week 1 learners are supposed to describe in their own words how a piece of music does sound like.
I give it such a low rating to get your attention and point out some serious problems.
Quite useless.
Instead we got something like 20 minutes of lectures in total for the whole four weeks, all on a simple framework to track face features.
Too much distraction as well, with "funny" videos that I had to pay for...
The Quiz is a scam designed to force you to shell out even more money of the so-called-optional textbook, and the assignments are extremely vague and orders of magnitude beyond the laughable 30 minutes the instructor suggested they should take.
Decent course content, but fairly basic.
I feel robbed from taking this course.
The professor was not prepare for the lectures and confused/forgot sometime.
I am disheartened and not sure whether this is a reflection of Scala or the course or both.
Poor feedback and advice with those who really do not know of programming.
Huge turn-off for me and many of my fellow students.
I know how to program, but I explicitly note I am not a computer science student.
I thought it was free.
I ended up having to muddle-through manually loading packages and dependencies, etc.
Consequently, I would not recommend this course.
Very basic in terms of material covered.
For an introductory course with no prerequisites, the assignments should cover material that has been introduced in lectures.
Wherever algorithms are explained, a really lousy job is done.
The instructor's slides are very poorly-done, relying on graphs that aren't appropriate for the data being presented and without labeling the axises.
The instructor even said as much.
These are topics and activities that I was doing as a student in middle school and junior high (both public schools mind you, not arts centered charters).
I am now in the 3rd week of Software Security, the 2nd course in the Cybersecurity specialization, and am realizing that 2 stars was a generous assessment.
I think this is not just my opinion either as posts in the course forum suggest other participants have the same view.
I would recommend more substance in the videos, or MoMA might switch to an article/book MOOC that doesn't rely as much as people talking about their opinion without a ton of evidence or support.
Followed the whole course in the hope it would get better but unfortunately got more irritated than educated.
not what I thought it would be, based on the intro
The quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data.
One quiz lacked background information of what data needed to be used (the info was available in the previous version of the course).
This made me stop the course.
The courses were okay till I came to this sections mostly done by Brian Jaffe.
The lectures do not line up with the assignments, and if you don't have programming experience, you could easily spend 10-20 hours/week figuring out how to finish the assignments.
It is like someone taught to be a builder and asked to build the Brooklyn Bridge ... Not fair at all.
If you are going to ask to build a bridge, teach me how.
can't not understand what he is saying
or anything but I have come here investing my money and time (out of my family time) .
This was further complicated by not having good debug output from the grader to work with.
Irrationally difficult and inexplicably sloppy.
This course was a loss of time and money.
Bad Lecturers and instructions.
This is not a reverse engineering course...
This is a tragically BAD course.
This leaves serious, hardworking students with little choice but to troll the forums for solutions.
Coursera offers many quality courses which are much better than this one.
Can you make the questions more challenging?
I was terribly disappointed in this course.
Some materials are useful but the teacher has no idea of teaching techniques and good presentation.
Sounds like she just read a text trough.
I really wouldn't call this a course, just an overview of VR & AR technologies and really general principle of work for AR.
It is not what I was expecting to learn from this course.
The content isn't very enlightening either, it's just facts about mobile technology and their release dates.
This course was ultimately frustrating to take.
I don't know how students without prior knowledge on these topics (e.
g., regression, ROC curve analysis) could possibly understand this when taught this way.
Course is also in an 'early draft' mode, with plenty of mistakes in the videos/slides.
Very poor material and instruction videos, with no logical flow or process.
Not much here
Not being able to see what will be demanded prior to paying may also be a coursera policy problem.
There are no visual representations, no exercises and no interactivity.
This is the most repetitive MOOC I have ever taken and I've taken a great many.
Also on the important information, they sort of skim over sometimes.
My expectations were a lot higher for a University course.
How can one communicate with the instructor or with other classmates?
Having said that, this is about everything positive that I can say about this course.
For starters, the videos seem good at first, but later it becomes very superficial and monotone.
The videos are too short and the samples demonstrated in the videos aren't thoroughly explained.
So, let me suggest a new title for it: "Design and Make Infographics for the Dummies".
This course is sorely out of date and in need of a refresh.
I could have skipped this course and simply read from the E-book.
This class is taught a terrible pace and is very old-school in it's thinking.
I have enrolled in this twice but can't see the course content.
JS leguage need more deteils, exemples and explaining, who I didn't find in this course.
The questions don't echo what was in the lecture (vs AWS for example).
I didn't like the class despite getting 100% on pretty much every assignment.
There is very little left for the students.
The guy is full of shit.
Always with 100% final grade.
The overall demeanor is not as professional as it has to be.
Only reason I see to pay for it is the fact that it is a requirement in the Data Science Specialization
The videos seemed loosely tied around a common subject, but it might as well have been a YouTube playlist on overall concepts of cities needing to be aware of climate change.
None of the examples are remotely related to the quiz to even give you a suggestion on how to solve them.
I took this course looking for ideas to improve my recommendations.
You never actually build anything yourself.
It was quite funny that many word problems were identical with only some parameters changing :) Buckeyes... please, try harder next time :)
I recommend the instructor check ESSEC Business School for analytics subject to better comprehend the Coursera and its goals.
Hope someone listens and th
I wouldn't recommend passing this course.
This course takes only 20 minutes to complete.
We are expected to complete a quiz for which we can submit responses only when we purchase the course.
She can not introduce animated elements.
Explanations are all over the place.
BlueJ is probably the worst IDE I have ever seen and I have been a programmer for about 8 years.
There are far better courses.
Much of the lecture time is wasted on things which does not matter, for example Djikstra shortest path...
The videos are chaotic and lack explications, examples, exercises and practical assignments.
Although the content is well done, the tech piece of the course is sooooooo frustrating.
Then what the meaning to learn this course?
I felt this course could have been added as sections to other courses.
Very poorly constructed.
In doing this course, I found myself reverse engineering most of the questions just to try to find an accepted answer and try to understand what it meant.
I like to learn via the puzzle method.
instructions for assignments are not clear!
It will be great if instead of covering all things in short amount of time, the teacher could write R code using each type of function in console so that students know exactly what to expect.
Can't recommend it.
Not impressed.
amateurish presentation.
I don't think I will continue taking these courses.
I don't appreciate the amount of time and effort given into the programming assignments only to receive practically zero help.
The chapters are short, but the first 16 or so should give you a good enough foundation to deal with about any intro stats class.
And the recipes... good god!
People with disabilities are just that, people.
very shallow and general, cannot learn much from it.
Also, there was a theme of lazily worded questions and answers throughout the entire course.
Not useful at all if it's audited.
This course gives good perspective on innovation process and how to bring idea to life.
Under no circumstances would we use journalistic-style infographics in the business world.
It uses mixed material from other platforms meant for pure Python programming learning, jumps between sections in the external platform going forward and back so its pretty confusing to find problems involving content that you have no chance to know if you do not have previous experience with python.
The best part was the explanation of Neo4j - and it was at an introductory level.
Not satisfied.
There are some inconsistency in the materials as well.
The exercise is interesting, and a lot of students have bought into the premise that this is a "genuine conversation" and allows them to explore their ability to know another person.
I could have pass the tests without having listen to the videos.
It is a shame that this take part of the specialization program.
We all bailed.
So for the price the charge in the certificate it really feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful at all.
I do not recommend you to waste your time.
Could not follow very easily.
I was expecting to solve problems using more open-sourced package.
completed the tests about ios and android without even watching the videos.
No allow to submit quiz
I suggest for the remainder of the classes in the series, the creators should do a pilot run first before releasing to Coursera.
The content is probably interesting, but they would have some use of advice from the entertaining industry.
I thought the payment was for the certificate!
I dont like the tools they used, it seems like a promotion for their company.
Advices for sources were very shallow and it was not shown how to work with them.
This class does not go in depth enough for debutant people to figure out how to do the assessments or gain a good understanding of what is covered.
This is 3rd time I a trying this course.
Confusing, convoluted, odd.
HTML CSS JS Are Actually not very difficult.
This course makes u question your own name.
FRP course had many issues about homework/lectures being poorly related, this one is even worse.
Useless course
Dr.
The interaction between the teacher and the slides is limited to a reading exercise that does not provide any add value at all.
If this class is truly designed and welcomes beginners who have no knowledge in SEO as it is described in course introduction, assignment instructions should be provided with sample writings or rubrics.
It says positive psychology but it really look so much constraint to even watch the first 3 videos without falling asleep.
Someone who doesnt pay doesnt really participate in this course
I've wasted over 6 hours in total trying to pass these broken tests and I'm completely over it.
I do not remember the ones of this course.
I do hope my criticism will eventually lead to a better experience for your students.
Too much surface, not enough depth.
The last assignment does not provide feedback at all.
The professor was very goodbut there is a lot of assignments !!
The only difference is the presentation of the information is stretched over an hour worth of video.
Too expensive for the content provided.
Grades are subjectively assigned on a very narrow grading scale by peers and the format of the assignment doesn't allow for enough explanation to develop a thesis.
TOO SUPERFICIAL
I do everything.
Worst course ever.
Sometimes with unusual choice of words.
It is not.
Additionally there was essentially no input from Wharton instructors.
According to my knowledge (my knowledge about Chinese philosophy come from A History of Chinese Philosophy, Youlan Feng; History of Chinese Philosophy, Sze-kwang Lao), that is not Chinese philosophy at all.
This capstone project lacked substance.
Instructor seemed to believe that underlining things in the charts served as an explanation.
I keep thinking I'll come back and finish the class but I haven't so far because I dislike how it's presented so much.
Very disappointed
Sorry but this is awful.
For example, in the final homework I had a simple mistake, but since we cannot show code, it led to more frustration and a mentor basically just saying "we covered this already."
To make matters worse, the minimum passing marks for each quiz is 80%, that wouldn't have been such an issue if most quizzes had 5 or more questions, which is not the case, most of the quizzes have 4 or less questions.
But that's because there was little to be learned.
As others have said, the first four courses were good - I learned a lot from the videos and materials.
This course glossed over coding however it is far more code intensive then I was led to believe.
Even the basic concepts are explained using advanced terms or examples that contain code far beyond a beginners level.
They also do not really spend any time going over the programming basics.
I could not upload a correct video as I do not have the knowledge to do so but I didnot get to finish the course which I think is unfair.
It is almost impossible to understand.
I guess I won't get it until about 2 weeks.
The reading material is heavy, the lecturers speak so slowly and dispassionately that it's impossible to engage with the subject.
I'm sure that there is really good content here, but I couldn't find it.
Maybe Google does not want to compete with Microsoft Azure and AWS alike.
I'm sure some of the quiz answers conflicted with what had been said in the videos.
This has ruined my life.
Little to no organization with poor coordination between lectures and quizzes.. Appears that there is no TA or course staff monitoring discussion boards...
While the lectures were a little slow about providing information, they were entertaining.
But I feel very mislead about the costs.
The class project is unbelievably simple, and the final metric for the class project includes duplication and one portion of the grade assigned simply if you feel the person you're grading "tried".
They were teaching and not reading from teleprompter.
This course looked lot of theoretical and I am not sure for whom it is designed for.
Video lectures were recorded almost phrase by phrase, making it too hard to follow the contents properly
There's no lecture on computing the angles and the full features of the framework.
I don't learn or retain anything meaningful from powerpoints and multiple-choice quizzes, and I know that many agree.
Without these features, following the lectures is significantly more difficult, and I can't rate this course any higher than 1 star.
There is too much talk about climate change.
I was familiar, with the subject prior to taking this course; was hoping for a deep dive.
Too many trivially short and low information density videos.
Why would you call it a course?
The instructor is very annoying and he talks way too much about non important stuff.
Don't wait until the last week or two!
The videos and instructions are very short and the information is lacking.
You won't make it 5 minutes.
The content of the lecture can be shorter, too much commercials in the lecture.
Hell no.
When any, clearly unrelevant.
The material is weak ,and the peer-grading process is very casual.
My submissions for week 3 total over 30 pages -- and I work a full time job... Avoid this class, do not reward terrible courses with your cash.
)I have a little background in programming, HTML and CSS, but I found this course to be an absolute nightmare.
If the instructor is trying to teach us how to program in any language, then I can assure you the data science class is not the right place.
Complete idiot.
All they teach you how to install git, R and Rstudio.
Horrible experience as a student.
Which leads me to think that no such code exists, or it's so rare that it doesn't matter.
*No Stars*Okay.... this class is very pointless.
The staff who comes onto the boards are just about as rude & unhelpful as any I've ever seen.
But is yet again a basic introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
So much time is wasted in the videos with arduous explanations of trivialities, and so little taken up with the imparting of meaningful knowledge, that in the end I abandoned the videos altogether.
Very disappointed and frustrated.
Unacceptable assignments length!
Totally disorganized, mis-managed, unfairly graded course!
Course Academy and historic
It's a shame that almost all courses are to be paid for nowadays.
Before taking this course I could find only one negative review, which I dismissed as probably being a minority.
most of the participants didn't have any basic business background whatsoever.
A waste of money.
But the second week's reading are uncommented links to a 270 page NIST document, an Open Online Course(!!!)
She is fluent just like reading the scripts.
Can you divide it or make it simpler?
Worst course I ever had on Coursera.
That assignment will at least take 6 weeks to do and that should naturally lead to course length of 10 or 11 weeks which would be realistic.
It assusmes quite a lot of things about web programming… and the assignments were too complex to just practice what we should learn in an introductory course.
I had a good feeling that I could really understand the material he was teaching.
No support provided by instructors.
As it is, the course is disappointing on every level.
If you have to pay for the certificate itself, then the course can't be too serious or maybe even that much helpful.
Andrew Ng of Stanford University, with his course "Machine Learning" is a great example of how it can and should be done.
Suffice to say it would be much more smoth, fun and efficient to start with 1) current real world relevant problem(s) motivating the technique, then 2) a clear description of the technique - with concrete examples mapping the theory to practice.
I found the jump in difficulty for the first assignment too great.
They lengthen the time of the course.
I have then been kindly asked to reconsider my comments under the light of the usefulness of this course to some audience.
Also, in the "check all that apply" questions, if one misses one of the answers, the whole question is marked wrong.
Too long, not enough concrete materials, too much focused on US.
Many people were not able to run the software supplied in the course because of bugs, but the solution was left to the student.
You cannot participate in assignments and quizzes unless pay for certificate.
So I try and try and try and never get all the correct checks for the specific questions.
Only a few minutes of lectures, no quizzes and poorly constructed assignments that waste a lot of time.
Unfortunately, this is a poorly designed course.
It is extremely basic, extremely general and extremely high level.
I think the course is really missing some key parts.
This is just blatant propaganda for the EU.
The entire course lacks a "flow".
The remaining 5 weeks would be great to help the students track their progress and get some peer-support.
The system of not being able to submit any assignment or quiz until you pay for the course is vastly uncomfortable.
If you seriously consider developing OS-based embedded system even just reading Wiki pages about EOS would not be such a waste of time as listening to this course.
Material is to basic for an entire course.
Not really a good example of interactive e-learning content.
Very boring, not engaging at all.
This particular module was flat, to say the least.
Not done with the course yet, but I have to say it started out very well and organized.
Not enough detail and information provided in the lectures to undertake the final assessment.
Reference and source materials are frequently mentioned in passing, but there is no comprehensive list of works cited anywhere.
And you most certainly won't learn anything new if you had some previous training.
And then suddenly there are assignments.
If I could give a rating for just Professor Ittner, I would give a 5 star rating.
boring
Poor context, no real examples.
In the first week you are supposed to write a research proposal.
Too many bugs with Coursera.
High on opinion and low on scholarship.
Very confused.
this course will make you write a script... and that's it, if you want to LEARN how to write a script, don't take this course.
This course just push you to write a script without clearly teaching you what to do, if you want to learn, look for another course (I took one from futurelearn.
com while in this course, it's free, this one is a waste of money if you pay)
I would not have paid the $80 for it knowing what I know now.
Not holding my interest.
The course is very boring and monotonous.
I found it visually disturbing and also have to keep pausing to read the slide before it switches.
It's too bad because I was really looking forward to this course.
If you are already somewhat familiar and are looking for deeper dive into R and programming you will be disappointed as the courses just don't have the depth of material needed to gain mastery over the subject.
Your money and time would probably be better spent on a couple of books by Wickham.
I suppose to use C/C++\python or other normal programming language as the lesson language.
Later lectures by the same professor are reasonable and decently structured.
Last minute rush job putting this course together.
The design principles were introduced at such a surface level as to be just silly rather than useful.
The code in this class is unreadable:- too many one liners, because "it's faster to write", though harder for other people to read- variables are named cryptic things like spIns or x, rather than names with meaning (eg, sprays.
by.
insect), again "because it's faster to type"- way too many cases of "there is more than one way to do it", which just makes things confusing because the other ways tend not to be equivalentWhat I'm most concerned about is that I've seen lots of poorly written code in many different languages: Java, C++, C, Python, Perl, and now R. But I've also seen really well-written code in all the languages *but* R, I have yet to see any code in R that is flexible, maintainable, and clear.
I was expecting much more from a Stanford or Coursera course.
It felt like the instructor was lazy to develop a real curriculum.
I left the following complaint in the general forum for this course 2 months ago.
I was hoping to learn about how to program to control the machine/robot but it turns out that this is more focusing on the theory instead.
I am clearly NOT at the beginner level yet I spent more than 11 hours on the first week, mostly due to trying to download and setup properly for the course.
It's a shame, because the JHU is an excellent University
Quizzes during the lecture were often unrelated to the material just presented or were given before the relevant material was taught.
The course creators obviously put a lot of time and effort into this course.
Despite the arguments of this module are extremely interesting and very useful for Robotics, I think the way they are treated is very poor.
In my opinion lectures are so superficial that it is almost a waste of time to follow them.
Lectures are completely useless and most of the time quizzes are note related with them.
In order to solve quizzes you have not only to recover prior knowledge, that it is obvious, but also to search for new arguments somwhere in the web, in some other courses where contents are better treated and explained.
I wil never pay for a Coursera course again, and I would not recommend my friends to do so
The lecture videos give an introduction to some concepts, but you are left on your own to figure everything out.
I expected much more.
Very boring...
Don't waste your time and money on this course.
Rather than digital marketing concepts, this was more an application of trends to traditional marketing concepts.
Something needs to be adjusted.
Not aligned to PMI.
I quit.
It's a mix of too much basic and irrelevant tips from different realms: pronounced english (which, in my opinion could be a great course of it's own), public speeking (only the basic of how to deliver which can be sum up to one page) and how to interact with other people (like how to say you are agree or disagree???
Poor English.
I'm an experienced programmer, and I thought this would be a good introduction to Swift; it wasn't.
don't e-mail any more for this course.
I think it should have been merged with course 2 as the course contents are as good as one week work.
In this capstone project, you're given a framework to work with, and asked to create an app with pretty minimal required criteria.
The teachers read the script and sometimes stumble on the words.
I thought, the course give us more specific materials that we able to use when we write an email, for example, inside of the mail what rules we have to consider or what words or Word structures we should use.
Really basic spreadsheet knowledge, not to be recommanded for anybody who is already familiar with Excel.
The entire course could be condensed down into a "list of questions to think about while designing your game world" - it really doesn't contain anything more than that.
Sometimes entire segments are dedicated to trivial things (such as "your game could have invisible walls!
At this time I don't feel like my money was well spent on these courses.
Unfortunately, there is very little to be grateful for here.
In this course, you get a series of super short lectures giving you an overview of the math and physics behind the aerial robotics.
Not worth the price.
This course needs too much C/C++ knowledge and the test are far too code oriented.
So much statistical terminology and jargon was used by the instructor, it felt like taking a class in another language where I had to constantly stop the video and google for the terminology she used.
Content is shallow, despite the impressive credentials of the Professor.
This is the second of the series, and I had high hopes for this one after the first one was a disappointment.
While the material was on the sparse side, the level of the course was more as advertised.
Fundamental concepts of programming severely need more time spent on but are in fact glossed over too quickly.
Hoping the next will be better.
However, training material has poor quality.
Why you want me to click 2 times to submit a review?
As a beginner, I learned a lot about HTML and CSS.
Homework, lectures, and the quiz are completely out of sync.
Pretty good.
The programming assignments are "implement Dijkstra" in week 1, "implement Dijkstra on a Torus" (and "do triangles intersect?")
It's unbelievable is how many way you can rephrase the same idea over and over again, without making any progress in something new.
A complete waste of time.
Sometimes I had to rewind the video to retrieve the points they were trying to make.
I think that is a poor course; a lot of much theory and little practice; is better read a book and see youtube.
Contrary to other courses that I have attended at Coursera, this time the discussion forum was no help at all.
He's just trying to sell you his book and his online game product.
I gave it one star due to actually learning a small something IN SPITE of the fact the prof is extremely inarticulate.
The teacher does not provide practical techniques that can be used by a startup for marketing .
A lot of academic mumbo jumbo that is totally useless when confronted with the infinite investment opportunities.
Videos proceed way too fast for complete beginners and things are explained without enough underlying basics.
The first week covers BFS, Dijkstra, and A*, something part of most undergrad programs.
The course is basically an advertisement for the software one of the teachers created.
You must pay to access quizzes and peer graded assignments.
Coursera is really moving downhill quickly in terms of free course offerings.
When the test required the "approximation" rather than the exact calculation?
Feedback was minimal and the system had many technical issues.
I would have liked to get a more solid idea of the depth of the series from the first course before committing money.
Default software for the course has near-zero market penetration (per indeed.
com), unless maybe you work at Apple -- not really excusable for something that purports real-world value.
This is ok and I enjoyed the humour and feeble running gags in the lectures.
But it doesn't justify the rip-off pricing at all.
Instead of These Classes Spiritual Classes will be good ...
However the capstone was a bit of disappointment.
I was hoping for peer-reviewed articles and readings that helped illuminate the history and the psychology of education.
(which I have not even taken)
The forum is only help a few people.
It was interesting and helpful.
- not sure I can even click 'complete' for the course.
This is a very bad course
There are too many mistakes in the examples and sometimes, the instructors look a bit unprepared and confused.
Too much of story and history and introduction.
Not very applicable -just a bunch of concepts.
It feels like a very disorganised course.
Paul Harris is extremely repetitive and takes so much time to get to the point.
I was expecting 4 weeks of work, but it was more like 4 hours.
Quizzes are ridiculously easy.
But on the other hand this programming assignments are...
I am not able to see why using such a complicated main code template is useful to understand the principals of the finite element method.
There is a bunch of wrong code and typos.
Assignment 3 was absolutely ridiculous in the sense that the implementation of pandas functions depended on data cleaning in the first step for which there was no help .
Trivial course.
We tried to use this class to teach a brown bag lunch for our employees interested in programming.
Boring
To think that I paid for the specialisation in order to take the graded assignment AND I have to do the grading BUT I do not receive support?
It is boring and full of obvious-psicology things like "passwords need to be secure but easy to remember".
I take this back.
The lecturer repeated over and over how everything is free but, in the end, only the first course in the series is free.
The Instructor doesn't give enough info about principles and her presentation skills are very week,the studying material also are very poor
The instructor wants the students to focus on specific wordings of his lecture rather than the concepts, in order to pass the quizzes.
Would have greatly preferred if open source tools were used.
Lectures are unimaginative, and there isn't enough supporting material or readings.
Sorry but the variable "peer" reviews ruined this course for me, I either did not get enough reviews or a "prankster" would down mark for whatever reason they had in their head at that particular moment.
Did not like the course.
From what I could tell, I learned all of the stuff in this class by the age of 10.
I'm really interested in the topic, but the way it is presented is just sad.
Further the course does not increase one's knowledge of Machine Learning in any way that justifies spending the time in the course.
This student's user experience is atrocious.
It was just idiotic.
a little bit old, and too many references to others courses
It was pretty painful to get through actually
1-5 scale for submitting a PDF, for example.
Most of the time it wasn't the case that the algorithm failed, instead the output was not as expected by the grader, although it was as described in the assignment.
Both examples do not make much sense to me.
Instructor seems uninterested or bored.
Course assignment requires knowledge that is not discussed in the course.
Again, to get to the higher level of understanding needed to pass ANY of the required, graded quizzes, the student will need to heavily utilize outside sources.
About two years ago I completed Dr.
The course is too gneral.
I can understand charging for a certificate, or for a Final project, but not right out of the gate.
the tool and the concept of data science is necessary, but a course organized this way is only for "full time students" that have only one obligation, study.
Both resolutions ONLY because another colleague is doing the same course and we problem solved together.
I am beyond pissed rn and I'm reporting this to everyone this a real comment about this course too.
I was so excited for this course, but IT failed miserably.
Also, at some point you are given a new version of part of the files in the project, which won't match the rest of the files so there's remedial work to be done for that too.
This course was frustrating, the learning curve nearly vertical, the material dense and inaccessible, and the evaluative assignments impossible for new users of R without outside resources.
Yet, with the fourth course I believe that either: 1) there needs to be a bridge course that prepares you for the bayesian course, or 2) the material needs to be taught at a slower pace with more specific and well presented examples / frameworks to work from.
italian accent is way too strong.
Would have been a lot more useful as a how to for sci-kit and pandas.
Thankfully I started the last assignment very quickly, it took me 10 days to understand how to proceed with the assignment.
When I compare this to the excellent Software Security course of Michael Hicks (University of Maryland) , which I also attend on Coursera, there are worlds between both.
I understand that "Cybersecurity and its Ten Domains" addresses students with less prior knowledge, but especially for such students I would expect a much better didactic approach.
One star seems harsh, but after the first two weeks, the only words I find for this are: "seriously?"
No real advantage compared to reading a book on that matter.
I just took the "Economics of Money and Banking course", which is one of the best courses I ever attended (personally in class or online).
This results in a highly monotonous monologue with awkward gestures and little actual content.
Great disappointment.
It's as good as providing only the PPTs.
Nevertheless, the information about the Zionism, refute itself and make us criticize about the dangerous notion.
This is a joke right?5 minutes long videos with questions after it shall teach me effective?
The quiz questions are sometimes not related to the topic.
It is the first course of the CyberSecurity Specialization ..
If so, this idea is as old as a Bazaar.
After taking this course, you barely know any CSS and despite passing assignments that don't challenge, you're probably worse off than a student who fails in school.
The course suffers from the extremely short timeframe.
Mo comment went way too fast no contact not deep
This course is misleading in a lot of ways.
This was terrible.
In addition, the presentation was presented by automatons I think.
I completed this course a week ago, and many of my classmates are not able to complete it due to extreme glitches, like the system not taking in their projects and not even allowing them to move forward.
I feel this course was severely misrepresented.
I just couldn't listen to him...
I found my motivation and performance dropped sharply in contrast to prior lectures in this series.
This course offered many interesting ideas about flipping school classrooms, but offered no suggestions about the practical methods to do so.
NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW R TOOL!This course needs an interesting approach to keep students wanting to study.
There has been no response to an e-mail, supposedly sent to the instructor on my behalf by the Coursera help desk weeks ago.
And this is not my first course in Coursera.
It's a shame to pay for this money.
Way too much videos and too little hands-on learning.
Boring Professor
Very often they include videos from reading.
The course feels like an outdated or a class for mentally defective: read about it, then we'll repeat the same in the lectures, then you'll pass the test with the same kind of questions, then we'll ask you to make an assignment, answering the question that has already been discussed three times once again.
I paid for all 5 unit money already and not in a position revert back and get the money.
Now i feel an asshole for believing on this shit.
The google hangouts seemed lackluster and draining.
very low length to content ratio; basic content
Old fashioned Econometrics course, still using the ideas of fixed regressors (rather than the more sensible conditional models approach), emphasizing prediction instead of causal interpretation, etc.
Too much is left off the materials.
It is told that to take this course, basic computer skills like sending emails and downloading files are necessary-this is a beginning level course.
Poorly designed, executed and instructed.
Huge gap between videos and final assignment.
Videos should be edited, we are not interested in trials and errors of the instructors.
Not the best tutor but perhaps one of the worst.
Frankly speaking, it should be the most disappointing MOOC I have ever enrolled so far.
The professor was completely inadequate.
But if you get stuck in a problem no one responds or guides you.
So many unanswered questions on the discussion board and many confused students.
Description of assignment questions is not clear.
This course is just pulling the knowledge without basic logic.
I can't pass because you don't allow me submit my assignment and asked me to subscribe although this course is paid !!
I categorize this course in the beginner level not intermediate.
I gave up in week 1.
For the start, the instructor can actually type the code and explain what goes through his mind during each step.
I consider this to be contradictory with the statement that the free version of the course gives you access to all the material.
I was fortunate to have experience with the tools, would have never managed to finish the course just based on the terribly taught material.
I can't have my certirficate and already I pay for it!
Felt like the course mostly taught you to remember stuff, and not actually learning a skill, though I broke the course early.
So you don't need this course in particular in order to learn the material.
In this way, to do the quiz is actually the way to learn.
There should be an instructor available to address specific grading concerns.
Its clear that the video material is completely inadequate and insufficient for the course.
This course also does not teach you everything about excel, let alone master it.
Very dull
There are significantly better courses and books available on the same subject matter.
If you go to the program's websites, there is directions to install it anyway, so this was completely unnecessary.
This is only about Probability distribution, binary classification etc.
Academical with close to no real life value.
Questions in the questionnaires that have not been studied and which one does not even know where to find references.
We don't even talk about the algo to use to do it.
I definitely would not recommend this course.
This 9 weeks course has been a nightmare!
First, the assignments always had poor instructions.
If you want to memorize what year countries started their public broadcast systems, this is the course for you.
It only briefly discusses critical paradigm shifts and shows.
Then the actual assignment is "Do this here, and this here, and then this here" and only when you have completed every step can you actually run the code.
This course is not designed well.
His lectures are poorly constructed, repetitious and sometimes confusing.
The course states all you need is "high school level biology" yet you require coding knowledge for the very first quiz.
It does not offer any enlightenment, but will only obfuscate and turn people off from wanting to understand Plato.
joe warren ur better than this
Not worth paying for it
Professor didn't do a good job on explaining the theory.
Overlap with some of the other courses.
The instructor has just left the course to take its own accord.
Outdated and unsupported !The code for the exercises was made for Eclipse ADT and Google dropped support for Eclipse a while ago.
Waste money and time!
This was by far the worst course in the series.
There is a lot of good content in this course that needs to be shared, but I just felt the delivery failed in a lot of ways.
Here are some issues1) Often, concepts are thrown out but aren't explained clearly.
It's 2016, and there are way better mediums for communicating with your students.
They would regularly work through examples just to conclude "actually that's a bad example".
too many interviews.
Removing that step makes the simulation run much more quickly and allows for faster iteration.
To conclude:This is a course with a lot of potential, but unless Coursera makes an effort to improve the course I would not recommend it.
Speed is very fast for a basic level student.
I was quite disappointed by the almost total inaccessibility of the staff in the discussion forums, the unconquerability of the autograder for most of the assignments (losing points for no discernible reason, with all resources exhausted), the lack of a stats module for the specialization, and the lack of education, really.
There are so many disparate concepts, that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least, demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in R. How to properly import the data, create the file, structure the data, and then perform some analysis.
Online grader for labs is terribly buggy.
Much less technical than I had anticipated.
Poor compared with some of the others on this specialisation.
There is nothing wrong with studying old, seminal research, even in this age of "Internet time," but I wish I wasn't left wondering what, if any, developments had occurred in the decade or so since that research took place.
As for tension between usability and security, it absolutely exists.
Somehow or another we should be kept abreast of tech platform problems.
There is not any free statement about accomplishment of the course, so nobody will knows that you have completed it.
A lot of repetition of "useless" information.
It was interesting to a point, but there was no application of the knowledge gained.
In addition, the concepts learned in the previous four courses were only about 1/3 of the requirements of this capstone project - the problem statement and strategy portions could have been done without having taken the four previous courses at all.
There is no real flow between videos and questions, not easy to follow.
Reading material should be summarised
They were incomplete and had wrong information.
Why are we doing face tracking when the description talks about location apis and "putting it all together"?
Not specific to Data Science either.
Teachers poorly prepared, explanations ambiguous, it seems that they didn't pay attention to examples and sound of the course.
I love Jack Wu written tutorials... way better than videos.
I will be going on to the next course in this specialization, because all the autograders for the rest of it has been removed.
Really disappointed you have to pay to be able to do the quizzes.
Difference between a Software Project and a Software Product - of course it is defined by convention, but it is there and is pretty generally understood.
The instructor is very bad.
A lot of theoretical stuff, nothing for practice; awful final exam strategy, the course encourages learning by heart without any thinking; advice: to help non english students (like me), make the lectures not overlapping the subtitles
Contents is very very poor.
Not so helpful.
So I went through all the open sites which were extremely disappointing.
Please update the given Gemfile in Homework.
Appears to function only as a self-directed workshop, which doesn't teach the craft itself.
However, weeks 4-7 ramp up at far too fast of a pace.
It provides an incredibly closed minded view towards all topics and provides very minimal factual information.
This course totally reminds me of some courses back in college: unorganized material and the assignments are unrelated to the tutorial.
The week 4 videos were the same as the week 1 with very vague statements about cities needing to experiment with sustainability to approach the challenges of the 21st century.
I was marked wrong twice for a question that asked my opinion!
*: Some videos are in reverse order, some are stopped in the middle of a sentence, some quizzes are bugged and don't give credit properly and there's nobody to help students...
The last straw was her saying that-that was an article.
This has to be the poorest educational experience Ive ever had.
since there is a lot of math involved, there should be some carefully written readings.
I feel this assignments lacks quality in contents, suffers from a flawed process and lack of attention by the moderator.
Only good for people who never did any kind of programming.
The title of this course should have been "An Introduction to Just a Couple of Topics in Philosophy."
Boring, didn't have strength to finish
poor course, saturated, with an instructer that uses big words and does not explain many difficult ideas, and take for granted that the leaner knows a lot of probability and statistics.
In fact, this course would leave an otherwise uninformed student believing that there are usability solutions waiting to be applied to every cause of info insecurity if the techies would just look.
Too advanced, not enough Excel
In my opinion, Coursera should rescind the instructors' rights to charge for this course until the instructors improve and meet higher teaching standards.
I'll be looking elsewhere to learn about Machine Learning.
Concepts stay concepts: we didn't visit one single town, a connected building, an innovative waste management system.
They may be great in the lab, but keep them out of the classroom.
Both of the main instructors are unable to explain what's going on.
Without any guidelines, how does review from a fellow novice help?
Sucks....
The audio quality sucks, the video quality is also miserable.
I would rate it zero stars if that was possible.
was hoping to learn better methods of interpreting or enacting regression, not the inner workings of the algorithms.
assignments got overly complex with confusing instructions.
A collection of links to other sites and short and highly generic videos
The material was way to dry.
The instructor was lost between teaching R and teaching stats, so in the end he did neither.
The assignment is open ended question and not difficult but took significant time, when I submit I was unable to pass.
there are always "correct" interface/usability choices; 2.)
It was really focused on high level concepts of different technologies, the level was really basic.
There is zero need to watch the lectures ( at least for the first 2 weeks).
The lectures are terrible themselves.
I mean please I am trying the best I can with what I have got and no one seems to want to help me learn and improve on my skills and my understanding.
Really Didn't like the course.
She keeps hinting on discussing the topics further in different section (Which didn't happen) this leaves me confused on why not discussing its details now?!
Need more (understandable) subtitles.
by Scott Rogers for begginers like me.
IDEs for Scala (I note the video tutorials says you just need some sort of IDE... but you need IntelliJ, and Eclipse to submit...).
Speaker is not energetic or something lacking.. makes it boring.
During that moment, I was waked up frequently by your emails which do NOT include a big deal.
The weakest of the series so far.
That is very disappointing as I really am passionate about learning robotics and looked forward to the other courses as well.
I fell that the topic is very interesting, but the professor does not do a very good job explaining the algorithms.
Everything discussed through this course is nothing beyond definitions and general business knowledge.
Unfortunately, not very engaging.
I think Coursera needs to have a conversation with the professors at Geneva University about the need for prerequisites before allowing students to enroll in this specialization.
functions?
The Android/iOS portion felt extremely rushed.
Well, this course definetely has a clear message and a good purpose.
Grounding UX design in rigorous statistical analysis is important.
BUT as a component of the Interaction Design specialisation it was much too long (nine weeks, as long as the previous three courses combined) and the coursework was un-interesting (long sequences of statistical tests with strange names) and very different to the creative and interactive assignments in the other courses.
Five years is tantamount to a generation in the digital world.
The information provided by instructors therefore must be "accurate and complete".
I expected much more than this but :(Leveraging employer brand is not compelete :\
I think that it would be a good idea to improve the grader, release more informative assignment information (take a look at the Algorithms course for example) and lecture materials in pdf format.
EdX has a great course on a true introduction to data analysis that is more in line with people's impression of actually using excel in that context.
Now, having bashed the course I do believe the instructor to be a very competent and knowledgeable individual, but I feel he's been in academia too long and has grown accustomed to teaching those who've been in school continuously and still have algebra/ stats fresh in their minds vs. those who need to brush away the cobwebs.
Not so good Lack of interest and practicability
The course is misrepresented as infographics for all.
Poor quality and heavily outdated content.
Don't call it "App Design" since it's more App Development!
The assignments and quizzes are very time consuming.
He has eliminated the useful discussions among students without explanation.
There could be a higher rate of success AND enjoyment of learning, if more thought were put into 'How to teach' the material.
Vast amounts of totally unexplained jargon and very extensive equations were thrown at the students with the apparent assumption that the course was a review for postdoctoral statistics students.
He's giving false definitions to 'personality' and 'intrinsic/extrinsic motivation'.
Not worth it for the bucks.
Instructor has tried his best to make no sense of the subject.
I would be happy for a refund.
I found it extremely basic.
Cant understand whats going on
and there is some technical issue with the content.
Perhaps break this into studies of common drugs, how they work, & effects and separately, the mechanisms of addiction and treatment.
So , I don't think people who visit this site don't know these basic rules.
And even the tools don't work properly.
This is in fact the worst course so far.
I was using this course to make a specific android app to control my wheelchair.
The instructor basically just gave us links to existing web content.
Not worth wasting your time over: they state that which is blatantly obvious and provide little insight into human factors of security.
After telling everyone how useful regular expression is but not part of this course (so he won't explain), he went on to use regular expressions for all the sample codes for the rest of the lecture.
We spent several months waiting for this capstone to appear.
He moves too fast.
The lectures are rather simple and easy to follow, but it's impossible to pass the quizzes with only a basic knowledge of mathematics/physics, only for experts.
Anyway, I would not continue with the courses if nothing changed.
Some of the topics are already outdated and some assignments were more applicable to those residing in the U.
S. or are not exactly feasible to do at this point.
Its a hard course, and u may only take the quizzes twice every week.
Although the course was very useful, I couldn't complete the course due to an assignment.
Two weeks in and there is little substance.
Seems mainly a re-hash of prior material slimly disguising marketing pitch of other Northwestern courses.
Could have been much better ....
should have been a proper video tutorial
Not being able to discuss with the professor why an answer is incorrect or even knowing exactly what about an answer makes it incorrect further distances the students from learning.
In some videos voice of lector is very quiet (-20 dB or less) and sound played from the DAW is much louder (around -6 dB).
I am forced to wonder whether anybody in the University of London team bothered to quality check these videos.
HTML and CSS is good.
Explains nothing about why the language works as it does.. Also it insists on you using their libraries and programming environments.
The pedagogy of this course is disappointing because of a lack of sequential instruction.
The quizzes are entirely disconnected from the lectures and require basically just finding and reading the right wikipedia pages.
I suspect many simply gave up since the Intro classes were so bad.
No guidelines for peer review assessments, technical issues, very clunky website.
I think the course should be worked over.
The professor is just reading the text.
She hopes to hide everything behind the canvas and just show how statistics are applied.
Great material.
At the end of the course, you are left with frustration for having to jump through the loops, but no understanding of the principles.
The lesson on GraphX was basically a copy-paste introduction to it's abilities without actually teaching how to use it.
Has been postponed for months and it's still only available for preview
Yes, I learned a few things, but the recommended reading was from 2010 and 2011.
If needed I can provide a screen shot of the problem in one of the quizzes.
A fundamental demonstration of how to use R to work through regression models (starting from square one) should be added so that this becomes a self-contained course.
Course content: some Swift specific topics are shortly covered in the videos.
Because of some issues with the data cleaning step, all my following answers were incorrect and I couldn't pass the course in time.
Very poor explanation and very complicated topics.
Very bad introduction to Python and almost nothing about Raspberry Pi itself.
Spacing and indentation are incorrect in quiz samples(I realize this is probably to prevent copy paste testing of code, but you cannot answer is this code correct if you don't know where they wanted indentation to line up).
Why then Stanford University doesn't just email his students this material and let them work on their own instead of doing lectures?I don't see the added value at all.
Finally, it appears that the $45 certificate does not worth it.
It just split a semester long course into eight chapters.
too general no depth, not recommended for science or engineering degree holders
Course does not do a good job actually explaining R or training you on how to properly use it.
The course and specialization looks promising but I get the feeling that the instructors have been a little lazy while designing the assignments.
Just a guy talking and sometimes complaining about imaginary students' hypothetical thoughts.
Nothing concrete.
Poorly presented.
This is because i need to actually read the documentation in order to answer the quiz questions since they are really in depth.
Students enrolling into the course are situated globally which makes it extremely challenging to gather data to understand and substantiate our work on the project.
Beautiful picture, beautiful title, but low content.
This course need serious review.
Very basic, the 'hands on' exercises are not very hands on and do not actually add much value
Quizzes were based off of extremely high level overview videos not covering anything specifically or deep diving into anything.
It took me 2 weeks (not 6 hours as tutor mentions) to complete half of the second assignment and I am about to tell that I learnt nothing about MongoDB.
He says that you do not need to buy his book or visit his suggested website, however that is all he talks about.
At least the tests are not focused on that, its mostly on vague points he explains.
I have a huge problem with the peer review process.
There are no course notes accompanying the video lectures.
very hard for beginners, very boring for others.
The only terrible course on Coursera I've come across, and I've done a few dozen of them.
It's not worth the time and effort.
Too bad this spec includes this course, it shouldn't be here.
Thanks Dr Matthew you're the bestMr Marco I didn't understand anything from you and I stopped the course because I dropped this module because of you.
I did not find the course especially helpful.
The teacher seems like a great guy.
A simple list of books to read would be much more valuable.
This is by far the worst MOOC I've taken, from any source, in any discipline.
Very disappointing to see it listet here as a university course.
thanks for your effort to make videos, but this is the first time find a class that i can not submit my answer to check if it is correct or not before my account is upgraded.
The theory explained and the exercises are not at the same level.
BUT it is so rude to send emails/notifications/greetings/reminders to me in a very early/late time (e.
g., 7AM, 10PM).
They're setting students up to hemorrhage money on AWS and possibly not get anything out of it.
I found the wording of the assignments really difficult to follow so I didn't really understand what was expected of me.
If they keep up this trend, I'll move to Class Central or other MOOCs.
Rather than starting from the basics, this course picks random information to work with.
And if you are indeed at the beginner level, do yourself a favor and start with introductory courses in Computer Science.
The assignments are very poorly designed.
Huge backlog of assignments from other sessions of the course that are waiting for peer reviews makes it very difficult to get your own assignment peer reviewed, even if you submit before deadline.
The first assignment is just a first review of the final project, but it is almost impossible to pass, because the questions are not organized in a manner of constructive feedback.
github).
I have been quite disappointed by this class.
No passion is on his lecture.
Magna Carta, Civil War, Great Reform Act, EU membership), which would have given a proper framework for studying the development of common law, through cases and precedent.
I found SWIRL to be 100% more helpful.
Disappointed with lectures-structured data rather than real life examples-professor is speaking monotonously, without passion-no visualisation on the discussed topic
Coursera should inspect this course otherwise these skeptical courses can deteriorate the reputation of this MOOC platform - I love the other courses/specializations provided by other universities though,
It's not a university standard course.
The Tutor tried to loosen a dry topic.
Labeling someone just reading the slides out loud as a course is ridiculous.
This leaves little recourse but to know stats already, or go learn it before taking this course.
I dropped out right on the first module
What we would see as a result of course (knowledge, skills (hard, soft)etc.
I only received 96% as a final result, even though I obtained 100% for every assignment.
I want to be a good programmer, and this did not teach me any programming.
The videos are not conducive to learning.
Course was taught by people who gave no indication they had ever bought a security.
This course is very strong with respect to presenting the concepts you need to know for data science.
However, if you are a serious learner who wants to actually learn something, run away from this capstone.
I don't mind accelerated learning or using other resources, but there's guide for which concepts are needed and where coverage for them can be found.
Really bad course.
Have been trying without success to retake the test.
Complete waste of time.
A major point that I would have liked to hear about is how to come up with the risk aversion criteria...
But they are just reading out the content - that's all.
confusing genes/transcripts/exons.
Very broad instruction but very picky quizzes.
was simplistic.
i suppose someone who's seeing internet for the first time would find it informative, but not very engaging.
of course i did not as i've just finish the course and now wait for my peers to review my final submission.
And very based on the US reality!
It says 'advanced writing' but it is advanced for college students, not advanced overall.
No accurate help, no feedback on the graders, 2 out of 3 assignments where not specified correctly, or just wrong... this course will only teach you to be frustrated.
I would give this course 0 stars if possible.
I am amazed that anyone rated this course better than 1 or 2 stars!The lectures are not focused on the information that is necessary for the obnoxiously long and tedious assignments.
The assignments are poorly written and demand too much Ruby expertise for a course meant for Ruby novices.
Do away with the discussion board or change the way the honor code is written.
Maybe the intent was to only show the worst case "Soul Beliefs" then shoot them down.
difficult to follow and see where we are and what is left...
As I was delighted by the first week presentation and way of explaining as soon I started the second week I was wondering what happen to the clear, concise examples and ideas presented in the first one.
I currently taking this capstone and I must unfortunately say that this is the most worst course in the whole specialization.
I would not recommend it to anyone, especially at the cost of $95.
Sorry the critics, but i followed all the courses and paid the monoey for the certificate, hoping that some week the course could show somethign usefull.
This course is not at all much informative and neither it is improving my grasp on the topic.
It should take the students through examples, live examples the student can do too, and things the student builds from scratch.
I would suggest look else where.
Not in-depth enough.
You are on your own.
Too much theory and no implementation.
Peer review assignments are too hand-held, making the assignments themselves worthless.
Nothing new to learn here, this is very dull in contrast to other courses of this spec.
I have to express that this is horrible, Please don't callout a course.
Again a course that comes with very simple (and not always good prepared) video lectures but for recieving a grade an enormous math knowledge is necessary, with no further help given
However, lecturer's poor delivery has taked me aback!
I am checking out.
Would HE pass us?
Personally, I strongly doubt that putting a bunch of slides and a few auto-graded exercises is the best way to learn about logic.
Sorry there are a number of times I have to rewatch the videos and still dont understand.
Quizes were poorly worded.
So I would be feeling good coming out of a lecture and going through swirl exercises, only to be plunged into a programming assignment that was far too advanced for the small steps I felt I had taken in my overall competence with the language and material.
I don't doubt that someone with better knowledge of programming can get through this stuff, but this class should be reserved for advanced learners only, or maybe be broken up into two courses.
Digital marketing has barely made a dent in their revenues.
Technology products don't follow this model.
Another annoying aspect of this course is that things are not well defined so they can't be applied.
No relevance to specialisation.
Restrict each video to a max of 7 minutes.
I did not explicitely terminated the galaxy instance for ~ 6 days.
I won't mind getting my refund back on this course.
NOTHING like described, NOT EASY for non native english speakers as describedextremely misleading..
More guidance to students in the instructions would be the first step.
Courses 1 and 2 could have been clubbed together.
In addition, there was minimal to NO detail on instruction.
Eventually, I gave up on the course.
I understand that this is what video marketing is about and, PS, not too many people truly watch the videos.
In addition, I think overall the tests are unfair.
Interesting subject matter, but difficult to understand as a native English speaker.
Now, this is why I am giving this course a 1 star rating.
The course tests are at times partially unrelated to the content of the lessons.
One of the worst courses that I have taken in coursera.
The videos feel unstructured without preparation and boring.
The quizes are subjective.
The first course is a basis for late courses and so weak teacher.
Not sure why Coursera would make such begginers class mandatory for the specialization.
The "Agile" buzzword in its best and most "religious" form.
I enjoyed the course and I would like to see more improvement in the future.
There is no real consistency throughout the course, it just seems like they are throwing random concepts at you and hoping you understand.
(Unless maybe you are a mathematical genius with total recall.
Content and quizz are not aligned.
Mentors answer to 0% of the forum posts.
Poor student community.
Do not pay for this course, just follow the swirl and/or get some tuto about regressions.
I wanted to learn more about programming, but instead I found myself tested on RGB combinations and building a website straight out of 1998.
It seems like very little effort was put into this online class by the professors.
Not really useful as course, but only as introduction to other materials... feels more like an ad than a real course
I learned eight lines of Java code in four weeks, and we never implemented any of it into a web application (viz, a script that actually runs in a live website).
Most of the time you will hear about how to design applications, and what is a good design policy.
If you are someone who is new to more advanced math or to any sort of coding, this course will be very confusing, totally unpractical, and you'll walk away not feeling like you've really learned how to use R in a real way.
I was incredibly disappointed.
Well the peers that graded my answers are not qualified to grade my work, useless, wast of time grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
Really not good.
The quizzes and assignments were to easy and basic (solved in less than 5 minutes) and definitely not enough.
This is not a learning course.
It took me a whole week, spending multiple hours every day.
Though the lecturer quite patronising and the exercises too juvenile.
"Blackstone" as "Blackspen"), making it difficult to track down better sources to supplement the lectures.
I can't actually be bothered to see this course through to the end, and am very glad I didn't purchase it.
This course did not really provide a good story to follow through but jumped around between loops, inputs, number conversions, file I/O and so forth.
Also, this textbook is horrible, and is presented in a very inconvenient format (PDF-only, two book pages per page of PDF so you can't effectively read it on a phone).
duh, not gonna pay $50 for this.
Speed reading a static powerpoint slide overloaded with dense mathematical formulas without using pointers or animations to focus the students attention is a recipe for confusion and frustration.
However, the final two options are BOTH UNARGUABLY CORRECT, but only one was briefly mentioned in the material (reading or video), and thus only that one receives credit.
Unfortunately, this demonstrates the course creators' desire to value a student's memorization of the instructor's own unique words over the student's assimilation of the course content and ideas.
Course-takers beware, this course seems more tailored to stroking Ms. Bravo's ego than to you actually learning anything of commercial value.
I am very unhappy about the Course Certificate for the following reasons : it doesn't state what subjects have been covered, it doesn't mention the hours of study involved.
In my opinion:The topics reviewed were too haphazardly selected.
The citations for quoted research were hard to impossible to find,The course focused disproportionately on the lecturer's commercial ventures.
Teaching should really be improved.
Very cursory and doesn't get into analysis about why things are the way they are.
To make maters worse, I'm sure Proffessor Bushee had to spend even more time creating this additional interaction together.
A very simplistic and chaotic course.
I found this course to be very basic.
There are much better videos on Youtube and Lynda than this .
The instructors do not pause and explain critical aspects of the code.
Overall I am very disappointed with this course.
Course advertised incorrectly.
Rather than starting from the basics they jump into picture manipulation and encoding.
You will lose tons of potential fans.
Completely useless.
The lectures seemed to jump around from one point to another.
it is all about money transaction, I am sorry to say that.
It took be less than an hour to watch everything and pass the tests.
I can't complete the course without passing the graded content, but I can't complete the graded content unless I pay money and upgrade.
I hoped for a fact-based education on current scientific thinking in nutrition.
fact is after viewing few videos into the starting point where the legit content should appear, I decided to stop; it is a waste of my time.
he is either not teaching and providing the real solutions or he doesn't really know much; full of trash talk in generality, negativity on points of view, and outdated methodology that is not practical in the 21st century.
I have proof to my review.
Worst course I have ever seen on Coursera.
Do this course ONLY if you want to complete whole specialization!Professor is simply awful, English is not her native language obviously, but even that is not the problem, she simply speaks sentences that doesn't make sense at all!
I'm sorry to say this is a poor course.
The course does not has lecture slides that is better for students to understand.
Very quickly decided to learn this elsewhere.
A little be difficult for me.
Attempted submitting labs several occasions - all fail.
Otherwise, look elsewhere for an intro stats class.
Very very general information.
Also, in course 4/4, the math tables in the videos are staggered all over the place and looks terrible.
Looks a lot like a yt tutorial, just much fancier because they are berklee.
Very interesting, but I was really hoping more.
Anyway, thanks for the hint about swirl.
Sadly, I found the presentation poor: not at all fluent, and under-prepared - sometimes what was said was different from what was written (which was correct), potentially causing confusion.
While the material is interesting and the mathematics and computer science are excellent, the format of the course makes substantive learning difficult.
not all apps wok on my devices so I was unable to do assignment.
I would never recommend this course to anyone.
Karl Gude is too much speaking of what he has formerly done, which is of only interest to him.
The instruction videos are fine, but the assignments are imprecise in their language at times, and there are certain key points needed to complete them that aren't covered in the videos.
It's good introduction, but the assignment are rather poor.
It's all theoretical and there isn't any practice.
Also, they didn't send me an accomplishment like the other courses that I already done.
The structure is not clear, with similar ideas coming up several times.
So think about how much they are loosing.
Honestly, for the price paid, the value given is quite low.
Hi, I am an IT specialist (30 years experience).
Totally disappointed!
Hope that all this will be fixed and I'll be able to take the course again.
Had this been my very first introduction to how a website was built I would never have progressed any further than these lessons.
They are short, and can easily be googled, or the slides can be downloaded and the answers simply CRTL+F for keyboards.
For example, for one part of an exercise I spent a total of 12 hours distributed in 3 days.
and recommend how to improve them for optimization."
Issues occur with submissions.
Two weeks back to back and one question each week has been counted wrong when answered correctly.
Way too much reading material.
This specialization is delayed for months now - very annoying!
This was the worst course I have taken with ASU on Coursera.
The same UofM course appears over on Udemy, and I wonder if it is just being repurposed on as many platforms as possible without the care needed to make sure it works.
I need to find a better course on this topic.
Most coursera courses are very well designed.
As if someone forced the team to put together something for Coursera.
Seeking out supplemental material is not only helpful, but necessary.
No value-added
There is always a way to write in non ambiguous ways, it just takes some effort.
The material is not mature yet.
They read flatly from the teleprompter and rarely looked at their audience.
So close but yet so far ...
Course concepts are interesting and the programming assignments are fun but the presentation can be greatly improved.
Criticisms include:(i) The course isn't self contained.
Zero interaction from course staff.
I commend the authors for putting together a course outside of their native language but, in this case at least, it does more harm than good.
In short, this course has the air of a group of first year students giving a presentation verbatim from the slides, as another commenter also mentioned below.
The "Capstone" provided a few articles and videos related to the issue (Yahoo Ad Blocker) to help us solve the problem, but clearly the course heavily lacked content.
The lecturer had such poor pronunciation that lectures' transcripts show that the voice recognition software could not understand and transcribe a lot of her words.
Money hungry, greedy!
I've taken this course for a while but prefered to stop as I found it very not academic in terms of ethics and objectivity.
Bad content and instructor.
First of all I expected something deeper.
Has she ever taught a class before?
Honestly not a very well designed course.
I would like to give this course worse than a 1 star.
Death by power point.
She seems to be reading (badly) from a tele prompt, rather than lecturing.
Typical software projects are bespoke applications developed for the use of one organization and typically automates a business process.
I am sorry, there is probably nothing that he can do about it and the course looked very interesting but I simply could not bring myself to continue.
More than that makes one sleepy.
b.
It is too hard to understand what he is saying, his accent is impossible to follow.
I cannot complete the course due to installations problem of the software required even if I have all the requirements needed on my laptop.
Barely any contents in the course.
I don't mean to be harsh, but this course is increibly boring and sluggish.
This is totally confusing.
No appelation possibility, no forum for discussions!
The instructor might be a good web developer, but neither she nor anyone else on her team know how to write a parser.
Besides, the lectures are not dynamic, it is just him reading the slides with the most monotonous and boring voice ever.
it is very basic course just giving the introduction to a layman.
I don't want to be mean, but the first week was terrible!
Unnecessary extra videos, that could and should be joined together.
If this entire specialization were a bag of potato chips, the Capstone would be that bland chip that didn't get any salt.
The introduction to the Capstone promises that we'll "build applications" utilizing what we've learned so far with optional assignments for delving deeper.
And the "4-6 hours" of expected student involvement is ridiculous.
Instead some people who have ideas, maybe even wrong ones, about this specific area of knowledge, judge your work (I could be also wrong about those things and have to grade somebody's work, which is a bit confusing).
Besides, the assignments are not very interesting or challenging.
This course is not relevant in the real world.
This removed all doubt that to continue was a hopeless waste of time.
No content value whatsoever.
I have no idea what I have learned.
This was a giant advertisement and got tiresome very quickly.
I am taking this course right now and already learning a ton!
The instructor is not good at teaching.
I felt like the course project was far more advanced than all the other detail.
If you want the have the certificate from Yale, you can take this course.
None of the previous classes will prepare you for this one.
Did not email when graded and had to email for everything to be fixed.
A huge chunk of the genetic part has activities where you have to translate large genetic sequences by hand.
I suggest to do this course ONLY if you're doing whole specialization.
Course is simply bad, teacher doesn't give to much information and project is very hard to finish.
Could have been merged into the first course of the specialization (Introduction to SEO).
I've taken $49 one-off certificate classes that provided 4-10 hours of content for 6-8 weeks; for this course I was charged $119 for 1-3 hours of content for what was supposed to be 4 weeks.
I don't think that someone interested in learning more about child nutrition is needing a slow tutorial on how to make basic oatmeal on the stove top.
I don't think we can call this as introduction of HRM because it doesn't give us any knowledge related with HRM.
They literally say "well, did you WATCH the lecture?"
Terribly disappointed.
My frustration is not with professor Wobbrock, who is obviously an expert in his field (though sometimes I felt like he's speaking in "High Valyrian" and not English).
The lesson is really boring , and the lecturer just reads the slides.
In the course of trying to, the IDE somehow managed to corrupt my hard drive.
it covers too little materials
Too much covered.
As a UCD Alumni I'm embarrassed my school's name is on this.
Just like other University of Maryland online courses - boring
I expected something else.
My course 3/4 in this specialization is still incomplete because the questions had wrong answers in the module quizzes and it was literally taking HOURS to complete the quizzes because you had to guess which one of the wrong answers would be correct this time.
I can only echo the innumerable complains from my co-students about the lack of efficient support and technical reliability of this course; many of us are very unhappy about this, especially as they have paid for this course ... and what is Coursera doing about it, by the way?My advice: beware before enrolling in this course and even in this entire specialization, and search for alternative options (there are many, not only on Coursera but also on EdX and others ...)!!
Except the fact that it was taught well, I believe that pressuring people work with a specific program to pass a course is not helpful.
the tutorials are outdated.
That's not why i registered on coursera.
The details and time invested really had little to do with digital marketing or the digital landscape.
Where does it say provide alt-text images for recommendation, make a tie to the recommendation, and list references for the images recommend, if not 3 points off?
I did not find that this course added anything to what I already learned.
maybe by the fourth course in the series, 100 hours later of lectures, you might have something practical but this approach feels wrong.
So was the first gentleman.
Overall, the course is ok but given the strict methodology and requirements for writing, I don't know if I'll make it through the specialisation.
Thank you for reading!
Yeah, they were probably trying to show their appreciation for the easy certificate.
I feel like it is a waste of my time.
I miss interactivity and I am glad that I decided to preview the course and not pay for it as it definitely is not worth the money.
English subtitles were promised and not arranged.
2.
This course has concrete examples, and the lecturer doesn't treat his audience like the first-grade kids."
The 2nd MOOC was supposed to start I think 2.5 months ago, it did not start at the time of this review.
They did not even bother to post some announcement to let the students know : ok course starts in x months.
Making things worse, you cannot get a refund if you purchased the entire thing.
Wasn't expecting such low quality content on Coursera.
A jurassic park image, with material you can read by yourself?
The lectures are boring and have no real content.
I don't feel that is right.
I have 20 years software development experience, and I can tell you this is too much information to cram into a single class.
Besides, it becomes focus on approving statistics equation than teaching data analysis in excel
This one is the worst I have ever experienced.
The instructor says in the first video: ”you do not need to read a book on how to write a script” – in my opinion YOU DO!
Limited in interactivity.
But I feel cheated because it will not let me take the quiz to move on without paying for the course.
Majority of the learning has to be done outside of this course, in order to pass the course project.
I cannot recommend this course anyone who is not deeply familiar with the topic already.
I did not find the lectures at all informative and the readings were not targeted enough to understand what items required focus and what information was more background.
I enjoyed the other courses in this specialization, but the capstone was disappointing.
Project description versus requirements were terrible, not sure if the new Coursera format played a role in the issues or not.
Terrible course compared to all others I've seen on Coursera.
Content is scarce, quality is low, maybe okay for college graduates, but being in business, it's just too slim.
Video quality is also terrible.
10 minutes later, totally as an aside, you get the explanation.
Tree exercise had absolutely no relevant video material.
So, we just had to keep checking and submitting ratings to see if it would finally be accepted.
You should be ashamed of yourself for pushing this garbage.
Light on content and heavy (especially in week 3) on political bias towards one political persuasion.
Poorly coordinated lectures.
Just brushed the surface of most of the topics, felt a bit too much like an ad for PWC or story telling about client engagements.
The mentors that are supposed to help you did not help at all.
This course is a total disappointment in comparison with all the other courses from this specialization.
The quality of the course is very poor:- reading links are outdated and not available;- assignments are superficial;- tests consist of questions which do not make you think but make you memorize unnecessary numbers;- lectures are presented poorly.
poor course.
If you don't have the skills to complete this course, you will not complete this course.
The reason somebody would enroll to distance programme is due to personal high workload.
I do appreciate the effort put into this course, but as a programming course it is not very didactic.
It lacks structure and even the names of classes chosen for the examples seem odd.
Humans cannot change the genome of any living creature, DOGS are WOLVES and always will be.
I wanted to know medically verified tips on getting the right amount of each nutrient into a toddler's diet and what, if any, extra vitamins should be added.
The course content is insufficient.
I tried moving to a different video with the same results.
Videos from WWH and ICLEI are clearly revolting.
The subject seems so interesting but we need more historical information.
way too slow and too long ; too many digressions, by-side remarks, lessons of life, etc ... go straight to the point.
Poor course.
I'm not going to disenroll at this time, but I have lost interest without even progressing beyond the first week.
The instructor has no idea how to teach.
very low quality and not practical
And from a learning point of view the course is very hard to follow.
i will do the udacity nanodegree one
There isn't any real teaching happening.
in answering assignments.
The lectures are too fast and high level, with no allowance given for people who are unfamiliar with this area and attempting to learn it.
** The use of excel on the weekly basis was poorly integrated with the flow of the course.
Is this for adults trying to learn or teenage girls trying to chat?
Answer: Visit the supermarket hungry and walk through the candy aisle first.
After week 1, lessons are just random notes on a blackboard with a link at the end to the excel sheet in which the instructor has already prepared before with A LOT of info that you need familiarize yourself with solo.
Too dull, no programming explanations.
very dissapointing to not be able to make the quizzes and the assigments without paying it
This course seems to discount experience in favour of "sense", used in this context as a poorly-translated summing up of the physical senses and their analysis.
This course requires you to create an intimate written self-portrait, which you then find yourself sharing with a stranger and comparing.
I havent been able to use C # in my PC so the course became useless
The course presents lots of concepts and papers, but it doesn't really seems applicable in reality.
It felt too "fluffy" and subjective to me.
I still son't know the answers for certain problems because the coordinators do not explain the answers well.
It wasn't until grading time you would find out what the criteria are.
Bye Coursera.
Compared to other CSS JS HTML Courses such as the one from Michigan or Hong Kong Universities which are quite clear and crispt and refreshing, this seems like a work in progress.
Only 3 panning approaches discussed in 4 weeks, thus disappointing.
She does not get involved with answering questions of students either.
To be specific, first and second weeks are covered badly.
I took and passed this course with a view to doing the specialisation but I'm not going to waste any more money on University of Michigan courses.
A waste of time and money.
I was not impressed.
No technical explanation included, only some keyword provided.
For instance, the speaker often only says what she is doing but not WHY she is doing it or what the function of a particular parameter is.
This course rely on commercial library.
Outdated, unintelligibly exercises, terrible lectures.
I had a great deal of trouble with following the lecture videos.
You need to use various methods to find edges cases and though that might be a good skill to have as well, it's just too much to get done in one week and somewhat frustrating when you're only stuck in one test case.
Sessions are too long and include too much irrelevant information.
The learning process is very slow and sometimes I felt that more could be learnt by just reading a number of books or articles on this topic.
There is no dialogue with the professor (or anyone who has more experience or knowledge, the assignments are checked by people who are also taking this course.
This should not be a course.
This course is good but instructor is very bad..... Not providing good course lectures and materials...
The level of difficulty could be challenging if you don´t have a bachelor of sciences like Math or Physics or Bio.
Instructor was boring
Lacks the slow build up I needed.
Although i did understand that it's nice that one can define his/her own operation/operator, when the examples came I actually got confused -- how do i stew vegetables with code??
Missing an explanation about a comma cost me about 4 hours.
This is the second intro to Graphic Design class I have take on Coursera, and I found the way the material was presented in the CalArts course to be quite slow and pretty boring.
I requested for a refund and I did not receive it.
They do not provide the proper tools to enable students to understand or pass.
Synthetic images, not concrete.
Do not expect to get through this if you have not taken multiple statistics courses at university level or higher maths.
Simple image manipulation is a good way to teach programming concepts.
Too US-centric.
The course content is poorly organized and executed.
They'll repeat over and over again in every week.
Given that I had to wait three months for the capstone to be ready, I found it a bit rich that my deadline to finish it was a couple of weeks!
You cannot learn a program in a couple of minutes!
I found some slides to be inaccurate which makes the material difficult to learn.
Coursera and this course sucks.
Only a classmate gave their ok "yes, there is something written".
I did not follow the course to get a "certificate" but to learn and to revceive feedback.
Overall, a waste of time.
The Capstone project has been getting delayed since JanDont expect yourself to complete the specialization
The teaching method did not quite please me.
The quizzes are taking too much time.
Instead of having Chris expound it like an audio reading, please include some slides, pictures,tables so that the matter to be learnt becomes self evident and Chris doesn't have to speak so much.
They assume that you know terminology and concepts that are not taught.
So why do you call your site FREE online courses?
It kept me busy for about 20 days (at about 4-6 hours per day) and I learned so much!This course "A Crash Course in Data Science - Johns Hopkins University" , Part of a 5-course series, the Executive Data Science Specialization, provided just some superficial obvious information, took me only 3 hours to complete and even this time I would could wasted time.
Finally coursera now starts to make courses smaller and smaller and them adding multiple of them up to "Specialization", so that at the end you have to pay much more to get a certain amount of information and course time.
This course is not so good.
However good the material and lectures may be, the use of an outdated version of Octave (which is not Mac-friendly and exceedingly brittle, to the extent where the supplied code requires manual patching in Windows and Linux) is a complete turn-off and makes it nearly impossible to complete the assignments on time unless you're prepared to spend at least twice as much time debugging your setup as doing the actual assignments.
I'll come back when this is done with R or Python.
You need to have deep knowledge in matlab to get pass the assignments.
Difficult to understand due to her very strong accent and poor audio, meaning I spend 90% of my effort trying to make out what she's saying.
Very slow paced and boring.
nothing new
In another instance, there was more than one solution available to an answer, however the grader accepted only one and there was no information in the question itself to narrow down the possible answers to the desired one.
Finally, there is no active community by the TA and professors, I have never had a single answer form a TA or professor, only sporadical replies from a mentor, who has no authority to fix any issue by him or herself.
All these issues just point to how poorly this course was designed.
i gave this course 1 star not because its bad in content, its just because i was expecting more due to the fact it has been delayed several times; then when it finally came it was like any other youtube or online tutorial.
Also I don't easily understand the accent of the speaker.
!This is not a course for Coursera!
Feels underwritten by the DEA, and aimed at perhaps high school students?
not possible to use headphone since it was on mono not stereo.
A course graded only by your peers !
there is no proper documentation.
at least there should be some clear instructions for first program
Really I haven't seen a course with slides till now,No one will be interested to take a course like this, with some slides to read from.
could have been a great course, but the inconsistencies have made is very disappointing.
45USD lost.
very boring lectures.
With the video lecture length totaling at ~1.5 hours, this "course" clearly needs to have more materials.
So much of the content was limited without paying for the course, that calling it a MOOC is a real stretch.
nothing helpful
I will not be taking another course that uses this loose of a peer evaluation.
Learned more about image processing than Swift.
Try somewhere else.
Please try and develop a true introductory course that normal, non-programmers can access.
You will be thanking me later.
All in all, a horrible experience and I wish I could get those 4 weeks of my life back!
All in all, the presentation of this course falls far short of the academic standards I expected from a university with London's reputation.
The concept of the course is excellent--short videos, quizzes, activity.
Fine - but if I'm paying a premium price I expect much better content and service than was received.
Please learn how to teach and interact with your students.
It's cheaper, takes about the same amount of time, and you learn a lot more.
I would probably be just as well served doing just the swirl() exercises.
I had numerous issues with what was offered:The videos were generally ok, but some had poor audio.
It is a shame I was very interested in the subject.
I am enough of this kind of lesson.
My experience with this course is horrible.
May be he is trying to prove something.
In fact, in many cases the answers to the graded assignments are listed in the assignment immediately following the question.
I would have preferred a lecture to make it more digestible.2) The hardest thing for me about the course was the fact that instead of practicing computational thinking within data science (decomposition, algorithmic thinking, etc.
Mostly it wasn't my humor but I can live with that.
This class was not useful for me.
One can read that up on wikipedia I honestly think this course should be taken off this platform so no one else falls for it as I did.
The course content is itself interesting but the lack of active mentors to provide guidance makes the course really difficult to learn.
I found them to be far more engaging the viewer and the format to be much easier to follow.
nothing special, I do understand this are fundamentals, but i felt like 5 year old
This is such an unreasonable requirement, if you miss only one question in a quiz with 3 questions there's already no chance to pass the course!The content of each quiz is also very troublesome, we are essentially being graded for trivia, a considerable number of the questions are very superficially related to not related at all to the subject of each lecture.
I have to search on the internet to get to know what she didn't teach.------from a math phd.
Planned course activities for a week - just 13 minute speech of the lecturer, telling absolutely banal things and a few questions.
The second point – it looks like tutors invent examples during the lesson (on the fly), this is bring a mess.
It gives bad reputation to any business school that endorses such "course"."
I was led to believe that I would be learning the fundamentals of graphic design, which to me means learning how to use Photoshop, InDesign, etc.
not good as usual one, the code you provided can not work, I had to debug againand the instructions for the assignments are not concrete as the last two courses
Ha!!
You are just fed with lots of concepts throughout the course.
The assignments itself are rather easy and can be completed quite quickly, if there wasn't the grader.
Rather uninteresting presentation.
Overall disappointing for a paid course.
As a comparison it felt like they had an hour worth of slides talking about different trees and how to differentiate them then asked you to drive a tank.
I then took the time go through two swirl assignments which I hoped was going to fill in the many gaps left by the slides.
Typically aimed at the US lifestyle
So the timings are not truly accurate.
Really unhappy with how difficult and over complicated it is.
Very disappointing!!!!!!
Rather theoretical introduction to the basics of an interesting subject.
Too much talking in a lot of these course offerings.
Coursera changed the rules on access to graded quizzes in the middle of this specialization.
Material is very high level.
You must purchase the course even though parts are free, it's really not.
I work full time, have a second job, go to school, raise two boys as a single parent and time is of the essence for me!
The lecturer doesn't know what he's taking about and what he is gonna talk about for at least half of the time.
In my opinion this does very little in making this topic interesting as it comes out flat and more work should have been put into making of this MOOC considering one has to pay for the specialization.
And on top of that there's A LOT of self-advertisement and links to Pavel's online courses.
It's a shame MEPhE put its label on this course.
No doubt that these guys are knowledgable but they do not plan the course or teach in a linear fashion.
The English is beyond horrible, and I don't understand the modern culture of having teachers teach in languages they can't speak.
The material used for this course is so old that makes me feel I'm taking a course in the 90's.
I had a good experience in other Coursera programming course: "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" of Rice Unviersity.
I think I won't be spending my time for this course, which seems to me like reading some reference files.
Poor taste.
When applying the git commands covered, numerous errors arose.
The program suggests that this is for "beginners".
I am running Firefox v50 on Ubuntu Linux v16.04.
I use another DAW in another OS, I even don't have a "command" key, I could have changed my hot keys, so your particular hot key setup is not any significance for me.
The content can barely be applied outside US, you don't know from which perspective it's explained (for sales or purchasing people), the videos are bad quality, the teacher is babbling, no extra resources, no interaction with the audience outside the assessments.
They demand a full concentration on domain knowledge rather than on programming itself.
The course doesn't prepare you for the final project.
Too hard to listen his English
The instructors leave out explanations and skip important points leaving you confused about the concept.
Example: In the Permutations and Combinations sections, "results" of calculations are thrown at you with no explanation of how the instructor got the answer.
Quizzes are a joke really.
I am sorry to say so, but the professor is not a very engaging speaker.
very general ideas about diplomacy but nothing concrete
For example, it says Part 3 is answering NPV.
The marking scheme for essays is filth !
I was actually learning how to use excel in the first week WHILE the instructor was teaching.
I studied hard and received this poor evauation.
I quit this course in the 4th week and I hope my following points are seen as constructive and help the owners to improve the experience.- On the plus side this course presents some nice correlations between bible and Babylonion sources.- Quizzes are too hard.
Bad video quality, errors in tasks and descriptions, no clear path through the course.
If you have any experience with websites, this course is not for you: it is merely about the soft stuff.
I gave up quickly.
Furthermore, a small number of Charity Evaluators and Meta charities have identified those charities which most effectively address the most common values of aspiring philanthropists.
I don't recommend this course for anyone.
Also this programm isnt working as good as it should.
If you were actually teaching it in a classroom with actual students you would go much more slowly.
This course was very boring and very frustrating.
It has been removed.
No systematic presentation of concepts.
While I usually love peer feedback, I lost all interest so quickly.
Jack Wu may be an expert but he does not know how to teach others.
Not need for a whole course.
real smart.
Also, because multiple answers are required for each question, you are basically answering a 4 part question that is only worth 1 point.
Contrary to the earlier courses, which were very competently taught by Dr Cetinkaya-Rundel, teaching quality is very poor in this course.
NEEEEEED TO EDIT MY PEER REVIEW FROM OTHERS
Totally just marketing materials!
It is very easy and unusefull course.
I am sorry I did wait until the last lecture hoping that something will come out of it.
amazing!
The videos are clipped short and cut off the words at the end.
I'm honestly quite pissed.
After taking the next course, I see that it is possible to deliver a lot of material and concepts in short order.
too easy, little content, can pass course easily without watching any of the videos
not worth your time
just begun, but so far so good.
Hard is because the wording is very ambiguous and not all understand how to review.
I never thought it would be this bad.
It's quite a shame that this course is in behalf the UMAN's name :(.
It's not worth the price.
This course is a joke.
many outdated instructionsinexperienced tutors who almost never explain why things are done in a certain way
As mentioned, there was no structure as to how he present Ruby/Rails as a programming platform.
Coursera is unwilling to provide any accommodation to relieve this discrimination.
I felt that the delivery was not effective.
Issues with getting assignments graded.
There are free SAS tutorials on the SAS webpage - I highly recommend completing them before trying this course.
It is plenty of mistakes.
for the very first week the essay required knowledge of the book that hasn't been read yet by the participants.
There's no forum to ask questions or to even start or engage in a discussion.
Difficult to understand, not a good explainer.
...
If you don't speak Chinese it's a terrible course...
The lectures are recorded from lectures at university and the rhythm is very slow and not very well explained (at least the first week).
Too expensive for what you get :(
To difficult to enjoy, unfortunately.
The course material was interesting, but the TOTAL lack of support forces me to give it only one star.
Do not take this class, it is not worth your money.
I think a way to improve the final project might be to make easier a little bit and give exclusive lectures to help students to do the final project.
I believe they should have included some teaching authority to check the Capstone projects for my better understanding.
I don't know who decided to do this (the organizers of this course or Coursera) but I don't think it was a good idea.
I was not interested (and I am sure I am not the only one) in receiving a certificate.
Good for someone who has no idea of anything about calculus
Only one week.
You should certainly put some polish on all these videos.
I have successfully done other python courses, because there, the instructor was very good and his teaching style was awesome...
I have wasted lot of my times enrolling in this particular course...
All very basic.
It is of no value and should be banned.
Things need to change with this program.
Just the common data type in python.
It took a lot of grit to finish the class, which was overall a very demoralizing and negative experience.
I'm stuck on one of the quizzes -- probably just something easy that I've mis-read-- but there's no way to ask questions, so there's no way for me to complete the quiz.
This course have very little to do with actual security.
I'd like to contrast this with the Wharton Business Analytics specialization that I'm completing.
The lecture taught me NOTHING!Consider I just finish the previous course "algorithm for DNA sequencing" which might be the best course I toke in the Coursera, this course makes me very disappointed!
There're only a few videos that are worth watching.
"What's Wrong with this?First of all, who invests in order to make it big in one year.
The content was skimpy and the assignments overly simple and rote.
I will have to think three times before I pay for a Coursera course in the future.
I was also a little put off by the frequent self promotions by the instructor, in reference to his treatment center, organizations and book.
Not even sure it worth one star, all due respect.
I can't even access the site.
Seriously an issue of someone not even looking at the video before publishing, would have taken less than 5 mins to fix for the entire course.
I would have preferred high level generic concepts.
Current product management is all about hypotheses, A/B testing, customer development, experiments, lean UX, etc.
You completely missing the point.
Still, this course can be a good one for those who want to start Managing agile software development.
Again, this material may be of use, but would be better as a primer for the class rather than presented as useful, paid content.
Many dead-end roads coupled with extremely long run times on the galaxy servers resulted in very inefficient learning and many frustrations.
what hte hell coursera?
This is purely subjective, but I could not keep myself awake and sustain interest long enough to finish the one section I paid for.
Save your money and just work through the free Galaxy 101 tutorials on the Galaxy site!
Yet merely stating keywords without explaining them makes the learning process very difficult for learners new to the fields.
No exercises, no code assignments.
This is more like a click-bait setup than the actual course.
It is just wasting time and money.
Why is it called free, if I can't submit answers to quizzes unless I upgrade first!I now have an adverse reaction towards that course that it doesn't really have much content to it, and I'm not the least eager to upgrade.
Universities like Stanford and John Hopkins find the opportunity to offer similar courses free of charge to peoople who want to learn.
Have to say: this course is not useful
Its ok. HTML is not "Code" its a Mark-Up Language.
Week 3 and 4 were completely useless.
The "course" consists of really boring videos of the instructor using Galaxy and in no way teaches you anything about using Galaxy or how it works.
I later found out there was some kind of tech issue.
When Caffo tells the viewer that they'll need to use other resources, he wasn't kidding.
worked with Wharton and Coursera to launch this course in order to crowd-source ideas on how to turn around the company.
$38 is a lot to pay for tutorials about how to install software.
It's almost desk work, not practical.
Short overview of history without much of a value.
The videos were lacking in creativity.
This one is an exception, one of the worst I've ever seen so far.
Refunded after scoring 100% on first three weeks and watching the theory portion of week 4.
The instructor does a very poor job of explaining the material.
Knowing and teaching is two different things, Brian!
I'm wondering if I can get my money back.
If not, student like me will need more than weeks to get use to R. I don't mean learn another software is bad idea.
I felt like I was listening to two geeks stuffing around and having a good time, instead of people who are professional teachers!I'm so incredibly disappointed with this course.
It is the 4th course I'm taking to get ma digital marketing specialisation and is far off the poorest.
In my opinion this course does not teach you to 'speak English professionally', but it teaches you to 'learn how to speak English'.
The final assignment is impossible to finish since I have 10.4 version in my computer.
This really took the joy out of programming.
I mean really I think Coursera needs to go take some hints from a real school or university and seek information on education and how it is best when students teach each other and If I can ask for help and learn from others and give then the opportunity to help me that whats the point of a discussion board.
On average I was spending about 10 hours per week just on the syntax for building the programs.
A little about my background: I have 20 years of experience in the private sector and am currently an analyst in cyber security.
It does not worth a penny to spend time in this course.
Course depends too much on multiple third-party sites to be as enlightening as I had hoped.
Why the hell are you blocking my learning until ??
If the previous course gives me the faith to continue learning something in Coursera, this course must be the reason that let me leave the Coursera left.
I can't even understand why there are some guys give this course 5 stars.
I am disappointed with the course because of its only focus on Apple TV and smartwatch apps.
Would like 2 courses to be taken by David and 2 by Jogesh...
Else the style becomes very monotonous.
Still appear messages that were reviewed and sent.
Prof is simply reading from slides.
Isn't that obvious?
Less clear and understandable than simply reading a textbook.
A waste of time.
Lessons should be 30 minutes each.
The quality of the slides is very poor.
I was looking forward to starting this course, but so far, checking through the delivery of the first 4 weeks, I can't see spending time voluntarily following this.
On the whole, knowledge wise, this is a good course.
Too much math and computer coding.
Not as advertized and way too much peer rating stuff--we do all the work the instructor does little or none--too much peer rating stuff which I despise.
Quiz is the most terrible part which seems like nobody could get it because of the ambiguous questions and paranoid answer area.
Hence, a lot of guess work is required to figure out how things should work.
This is not a course for beginners, even though you go through all previous the courses.
There is no interaction at all with the professors or tutors.
The Projects are evaluated by your own Classmates.
Wordy, dirge like.
It is been quite difficult to follow through the course and I bet many students are giving up.
Best of luck.
This course is a rare example of how it`s not done.
I wish I had paid closer attention to the refund policy.
Each video is only 1-2 minutes long, so you can watch all 7 weeks in half an hour ( speed 1.5).
Pictures from the powerpoint are at least for half of them taken from pictures bank.
Complete garbage...
items not really presented in relevant details with respect to standard industry practices.
Translation from English only on the first slides.
Videos and materials are fine, but insufficient for the quizzes, which are apparently very difficult even for PhDs in the field.
I do not recommend this course
on a personal laptop.
I do not expect this from the university of Toronto.
There were even a few typos and errors.
This shouldn't be on Coursera, and an organization making a course like this shouldn't be allowed to call itself a university.
Joined this course as I was really interested in understanding meditation itself from a scientific perspective.
I thought it was going to be good.
Most slides / videos are quite useless for teaching because they skip over important steps without giving appropriate explanations.
So you have no idea which lecture you should watch again.
Assignments: The assignments were very bad prepared.
Its really hard to communicate with Coursera.
I've taken a few coursera courses, and this was the most frustrating course I have taken.
Disappointed though because I really wanted to learn Swift.
this was a really boring course not for the contet bu the teacher i fell bored every video because the theacher was really slow in everything tha she was showing, it is realy dificult to get focussed in the real topics when the teacher spend a lot of time explaining things at the end wont be evaluated.
If you want to learn Android programming, I suggest you look elsewhere.
As it stands, it shows a huge disrespect for the student's time and effort.
Can't actually be done as a free course, like others on the site; you have to pay just to get a quiz grade.
For example, the size of the images is often compromised because they chose to show the professor on the left side of the screen, even though it is absolutely unnecessary to do so.
Overall, I do not recommend this course.
I will continue, with help from other materials outside the course.
The most terrible course I have ever seen in my life and on this site.
No guidance.
The concepts here are useful and Mr. Egger is a knowledgeable instructor but 1) this class is really about gathering information with Excel as the tool - you aren't learning anything about Excel functionality, so the title of this course is really misleading if you just want to become a stronger user in Excel 2) there is a huge disconnect between the video lessons and the excel worksheets used to complete the assignments and since many previous reviewers mentioned this, it seems like that's not going to change.
Zero effort to respond in the discussion forums.
Money thrown away.
Khan Academy, DataCamp, Udacity, Duke (Coursera), and Columbia (edX) all have great courses.
Nice form, shallow content.
Won't teach anything to anyone with the most basic computer science background and knowledge.
The most useless assignments in any Coursera course I've ever seen, that require no useful (or any) knowledge to complete.
Everything else was very well done, and I congratulate Ms. van Lent on her course.
Stupid quesion appeared in quiz three: which key combinations we use in the videos?
The two or three minute videos were annoying.
That's a reasonable task to perform once or twice, but it rapidly becomes extremely tedious and detracts from the other materials that are being taught.
The final assignment doesn't do a particularly good job evaluating the required test condition.
If you do take the course I'd want you to know:You should expect to modify the provided code to fix their bugs.
There are no "gotcha" quiz questions.
Not good for academic discourse.
Utterly disappointing.
Which SHOULD have been told to students prior to them spending money on the course.
The course content for operation analytics and People Analytics were indeed very useful.
I had originally signed up for parts 1 and 2 of this course.
I do not recommend this course.
The course do not match its price at all, it is catastrofically sketchy.
!In one word BAD!
non-rich course!
I suggest a 60% passing grade with a more challenging assessment.
If you call reading the PowerPoint presentations a course, then don't miss the chance and enroll here !
The course in more on the level of a 201 and in certain parts 401 level but not 101.
But some questions are quite artificial, for example, there's a multi-choice question about "what are the different ways one can find help..."(3) Finally, I find the video and the quiz very abstract.
Outdated in some way when it comes e.
g.
Does Coursera offer introductory courses to Ruby or Ruby on Rails other than this "introduction" course?
Second assignment seems straight forward, but the template they ask that you follow contains small tricks which appear to be FAR BEYOND anything touched on in lectures.
I'm actually going to fight for my money back, what a scam.
In the first week, students basically learn how to start Xcode.
Physical concepts like 'resultant moment', 'inertial and body-fixed frame' and 'torque' are used without definition.
The course title is quite mis-leading
this doesn't feel right!
I found there was too much information given in the course lectures without enough practice to learn bit by bit to really understand what I was learning.
This course is
No use at all
The poor evaluation comes from the composition of the review quizzes: The end-of-section quizzes ask questions to which there can be more than one correct answer, yet only a single response will receive credit.
Example: "A recommended solution to a problem is valued by an executive because..." Followed by four possible answers: One of which is clearly incorrect while one makes an awful assumption.
It´s BARELY READABLE !
It needs very good prerequisite about computer vision.
The course is very interesting but there is a problem with the quizzes, it doesn't accept correct questions.
Worst course on Coursera.
My advice, save your money and don't take this class.
Difficult to navigate and all the links used including that for Galaxy are outdated.
$64 gets you further with Nick Walter or Rob Percival's Udemy course.
There are also some serious issues with glitches, technicalities and not being able to pass assignments and grade others' assignments.
I left it because of that.
£40 wasted.
This course is garbage.
In just the first 2 weeks I found several quiz questions that are not correct.
Got lost and left behind very quickly even after watching videos numerous times and doing additional research.
I don't need the teacher to read Aristotle for me.
Very frustrating and disappointing experience.
repetitive content with other MOMA courses (modern art&idea)??
As a stand-alone course this would be very good.
Story telling module, not really useful for IOT purpose.
(iv) The programming assignments while fun were somewhat ad hoc and disconnected from the lecture material, specifically, the main task of every single assignment was to hand tune a pd controller.
If you don't have access to a printer, trying to break up genetic codes into 3-letter codons and translating them is an exercise in frustration.
Boring.
The course is essentially just a review of formulas with very little intuition explained to the beginner.
Example projects were not similar at all to actual projects and relied heavily on search engines to figure out what was asked of me
because they were completely caught off guard by the huge knowledge gap between lectures and the final assignment.
My post in the forums about this is unanswered for 3 days now.
I faced with technical difficulties till this weekend.
Horrible, endless rambling, no solutions to the quiz questions (unlike cal 1 course).
Week 3, "Advanced Swift," consisted of one 12-minute video that barely scratches the surface of three separate topics.
Many things that I would consider fundamentals for this type of programming course (classes, for example) were rarely even mentioned, much less taught and demonstrated.
If you want to learn Swift, look elsewhere.
The jupyter notebook made this a horrid experience.
This course and its twin "Introduction to Smart IoT Devices" are an expression of imposture at high level.
JS search for another course.
There are no insights in specifics of child nutrition besides general concepts of balanced diet and some tips how to make your kids be more enthusiastic in eating vegetables.
And you couldn't feel you could practiced what you learned in the course in the assignment.
Hope the 3rd one will be better.
Not really useful ~ I would like to email in a PDF of my comments covering this course and the second course in this series
It could works for the first course, but not for the second.
The other courses were really good but with this course I:Learned nothing newUnlearned best practises from the previous coursesMick doesn't seem to understand what he is presenting himself at times, the supplied code does not match the video's, the assignments change when I already submitted it (from upload a zip to deploy) and the assignments are copy pasted.
Good overview.
Professor Ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content.
The user interface gets stuck without reasons.
class structure is messy.
A lot of speaking without any sense.
this course is very poorly structured.
the quizes are poorly written, even for me, a native russian speaker, it was often hard to understand the questions, and sometimes its plain guess work on the opinions of the course authors.
I have recommended it to friends who are not native speakers of English, but as a native speaker I found it slow, expensive and the assignments to be actually annoying.
Apparently I should write about certain cases, but I couldn't find the content of the case.
The course is rather poor and not challenging.
It very short and brief.
My disappointment lies with UCSD which included the course of such depth of information and a strong requirement for understanding R, without much thought on whether students will be able to follow.
doesn't have to be that complicated with command prompt actions from the beginning of the course, that make the motivation drop very fast.
Concepts are fantastic but the material developed to deliver the course is short of expectations, especially from a university.
After completing the entire course & listening to many of the lessons several times, I can't tell you "what we like to hear and why".
Neo-liberal and neo-con presentation of the matter that has little to do with how the real world works, or should work, had we had a fair play field.
I felt at the end of the course I didn't learn anything.
And if your instructions aren't clear, you aren't doing the job of an instructor when you pass the buck and try to sell it as "part of the learning experience."
However I sampled some of the course videos in the different courses making this specialization and decided against it.
In the course videos we see no teacher or lecturer just pictures of people and power-point slides with a flat voice in the background reading the slides.
Instructors are clueless on the plan
Really confusing and struggled a lot.
This makes it boring to hear and she comes across with no personality (although a quick rate-my-professors search tells us a very different story, a real shame since people seem to really like her).
I think we should have a language button to translate to English or any other language that takes cources from Corsera.
You should be able to check your work as you go, or experiment with different ways of writing things.
I quit this course as it does not live up to the specialization which it begins.
I found myself on many occasions asking, "What exactly does this line or block of code do?
A couple of students in the forum strugeling with details, but there is NO Mentor, no Professor or other course staff and no SwiftKey engineer as announced in the Project Overview.
So everything you have to figure out completely by yourself and this takes a lot of more time than the 4-9 hours.
Disappointed.
See for books if you want to learn something.
Truly, Coursera, what happened to your open education offering real education?
Last week was incredibly difficult.
I am horribly disappointed at the quality.
Again I appreciate feedback, but unless in my classroom with my kids and doing something I have done numerous times at the request of my own principal I did not thin it was fair.
The mentor in the forums is lousy, and his responses are worded as if he's talking with a peer and not a beginner/student.
I may or may not try another coursera course after this.
I rate the course so poorly, however, because of the total lack of staff involvement and the worthless peer review papers.
At the moment, I don't think I'll continue this specialization the way it's designed.
I definitely WOULD NOT pay for this course.
I will change the rate after I watch more videos, but this course is a big no-no for me.
Use of Duke own specialised librarie ~ not the best way of learning progamming for the real world.
Tests were not that helpful and the instruction to the last homework was quite bad (many open questions).
I´m quite disappointed in this course.
The assignments are just open discussion among students and have ourselves evaluate with each other.
Do not recommend to audience with
the whole waste of time and energy
I enjoy Edinburgh University's Coursera courses, but I shall be wary of any of a similar ilk and certainly won't buy the certificate this time.
The course is a great course in terms of the knowledge and experience of the instructor and the helpfulness of the staff.
I am way better off supporting AWS and Azure (at least they have tons of good trainings and stuff to keep folks in the field excited).
I also feel that this course teaches students to memorize steps needed to accomplish certain operations in Galaxy without explaining why it occurs.
Maybe since I didn't take specialization but I feel that this course was too theoretical.
I am dropping this course as it is too elementary.
I wrote the assignment for week three but there were no instructions on how to convert a document in textedit (Mac WP) to the course submission page so that was a total crash for me.
Nobody seems to monitor the forum.
Overall the specialization feels ill-organized and of questionable quality, and there are plenty of negative sentiments in the forums.
All this course content could be packed into an introductory lesson instead of having to pay for it.
Still, I stuck with it for three more weeks.
Complete rip-off and easily the worse course of the half dozen I've taken on Coursera on various topics.
Not enough notes.
Moreover, the presentation style is very boring.
More importantly, this course is filled with "neuro-babble".
This is more of an introduction to statistics lesson than one in excel... not what I had signed up for
And now the complete absence of videos.
Each week is a very light overview of a topic.
The feedback given to the same responses between retakes is contradictory.
Gosh I hated hated hated this course.
I was expecting the course to contain hypothetical data for us to interact with and predict how the Ad blocker problem and our proposed solutions would drive the data of Yahoo's business.
Very disappointed in this.
The content was delivered way too fast for me to keep up and process it.
This is the specialisation that sucks all joy out of the entire course.
The lecture is not much helpful than I thought it would be.
The rest of the information are very very basic knowledge about character and world design, without being vinculated through metodologies to the games!, only with empty words of inspiration recorded in useles videos.
doesn't show the videos.
I decided to cancel my subscription as there are better options on EdX and other Coursera courses.
The Spark courses from edX are way better than these.
Much less material presented for concepts shown.
The lecturer is not trying to be engaging or at least pleasant to listen to.
Sloppy, unorganized, and poorly presented.
The instructor is not putting in much effort to make student understand the concept.
I think it could be funnier...
A simple list of programs that needed to be installed would cover 90% of the course content.
This is probably one of the worst courses I've taken in Coursera.
Just an enumeration of what's on each version of the operative systems and few more information.
This really shakes my confidence in Coursera for future courses.
It is almost as though she tried to memorize a sheet of definitions and repeated them without the use of her notes.
First you should know that the first week doesn´t reflect at all the rest of the course in difficulty and in matter.
I was not even informed what the passing mark is before I received my grade ,all the instructions for assignments are absurdly unclear!
The production quality and content did not meet my expectations.
I am taking another course which as well has peer review, I am rethinking if it's worth it.... do not see any value, there is no real feedback from instructor.
Just reading.
This to me seems more like a fuck up on the side of Coursera, which didn't find an agreement with Stanford University so no material had been produced until now.
Common information about nothing.
That text now seems to have been removed.
Anyway, none of these promises were kept.
This capstone project is a bad joke and I'm gonna tell you why!First, ESSEC TAs were never available!
The purposes of these courses is to learn from experts in the field not to grade the work of others.
That was very disappointing!
the instructor voice are so calm , so i cannot concentrate well
just money involved in each subsectionswhich r the most interesting parts
This course is really bad.
This course is very similar to music production but using only pro tools.
If you are looking to learn more about music production using pro tools, then this is an awesome course but if you already have some background in music production and you just want to learn pro tools basics, then I don't think this is an appropriate course (in my opinion).
The actual material in the course is fascinating and quite useful but, as is common with so many Coursera courses, the enjoyment of completing the course is severely hampered by the requirement to review the final assignment of other students.
I have to say that the part of codepen and HTML was great.
Fortunatelly, I didn't pay.
The idea that a baby thrown in the water may just learn to swim rather than drown is pedagogically retarded.
This is a very old fashion way of looking at development and developers.
(1) examples in the course are not thought through ahead.
There was a guy who answered with SQL query.
In some cases, I believe students failed that portion of the course because they could not figure out how to submit.
very bad demonstration
To be honest, there are no techniques here that cannot be found in many other places.
that way it may not be the best example to convey the message, plus the videos are made unnecessarily long in this way.
I was expecting something else, very basic information.
And she obviously doesn't have computer science background, if she does then she is even worse then I thought.
I did not enjoy how this course was taught.
And I still think that this course was of no interest to me - this is the reason why I'm still pleased not to have paid for its useless certificate.
No go.
It spreads anxiety and takes too much liberty with History.
the peer grading system is poor, considering that they are learning just like us.
the grading should be done automatically or by a professional .
Very disappointed with how the transition from the old Coursera platform to the new platform has been handled: lots of instances of the "see lecture X" in the quizzes where the reference is now just wrong because the lectures got renumbered, an almost complete lack of community TA/mentors, and no explanations from anyone as to how the new platform works.
Perhaps the worst of all has been the almost complete lack of acknowledgement of any problems from the folks at JHU.
However it was disappointing to me that content of the course has nothing to do with Art and Culture.
If I could I would ask for a refund.
There are also technical bugs and missing images in the quizes.
Test design is horrible, too many negative questions.
(And not impressed with this automatically centered text box either.)
The level of the course is far too basic to be of value, but is required for the specialization.
Important material, poorly taught.
I could have learned the same using the Tableau first video in 10 minutes.
Tortured by a platform glitch that initially denied me credit for my work and the certificate of completion but would not tell me specifically why.
This is the worst course online I've done so far.
Not very useful.
The 'classroom' type lectures were pretty reasonably good.
Rudimentary HR / new supervisor level information.
None of the videos are related to the quiz.
If you're the kind of person who can learn from reading a powerpoint slide, then you'll be fine.
Cannot take the exam, I have to pay... wtf...
I could repeat everything by myself, just pause video and replay interesting fragment.
i hate to say it, but this course is really really bad ... not practical at all.
Doesn't worth the effort.
I did all four courses - the whole specialization.
If this was a way for Kimberley to increase her brand presence it did not go well.
The course is scatter and although it claims to be for beginners, it covers programming concepts rather quickly.
In my opinion, this course is a waste of time, it simply throws a bunch of links and terminology for you to google and research.
He's too lazy to even type out the codes and has the world's most monotonous voice.
He pauses often to read this notes and has 0 enthusiasm teaching this class.
In my view, a university should not be promoting a proprietary product.
Embarrassing.
They are cherry picking.
Lack of support from course teaching staff in answering student's questions.
Finally I feel as I didn't learn anything.
Components are also helpful for cancer patients, anxiety, and more.
No response to questions posted.
I want to rate zero but there is no such option available.
Must be improved to keep attention.
Unfortunately, this is one the worst paid courses I've taken on Coursera.
For this course I need lots of time to complete the quiz in contrast to other coursera courses I did.
I hope that the spirit of Coursera is not changing to a "pay to play" site.
Seems like he's just talking, but his mind is elsewhere.
Please have a look at "Advanced Swift" lecture, I am talking about closures.
Also, in the part one, the last exercise was tremendouly difficult for begginers and for someone (my case) that know one language.
You are making people hate Java.
Got a couple of nice links to color scheme generator et cetera, but did not deliver what I thought it promised.
The basic grammar is also skipped over in explanation.
Poorly constracted course!
It did not fill my expectations.
I would consider getting a certificate, if it means something hence beyond a very basic crash course.
I think this could be an excellent course with a few modification on the slides and adding more motivations and making shorter homework problems that focuses on the main part of the material for that as oppose to things we've already covered in the previous week.
I wasn't impressed...
v few or new material
Extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just to be able to charge for it.
The title of this course is Paradoxes of War.
For instance, just have a look to the course "Machine Learning" of one of its co-founders, Andrew Ng.------------------------------------My previous comments here below:For sure I was not the correct audience for this course.
The videos doesn't tell anything related to the test.
the video is too long!
This orients the user in the application and helps them to find their way around when they are trying to reinforce your teachings later.
The presentation for this course is so unprofessional.
I have studied some Bayesian Statistics before.
Seemed basic to me, but maybe that's because my background is communication and content strategy.
Had to verify multiple times.
This course started two months late, and I could not get a refund before the course even got under way!After taking nearly 6 months to wade through a little over half the course requirements, I decided to look at the rest of the assignments and project.
Examples have to be more clear.
I left the course
-- to make sure you've drunk your art-establishment Kool-Aid.
Professor is very knowledgable but he is fast...
This is very frustrating!
If this is what the world considers a "genuine" conversation then the world is a shallower place than I had thought.
This course, unfortunately, over-promises and under-delivers, and I am not in the least tempted to take the next one in the series.
They jump around too much and it is very hard to follow.
Slides are too full of written lines that professor Navarro simply reads.
This course was delivered 6-months behind schedule and the assignments half-way through the course can't even be completed due to technical problems and sloppy content.
only theory and slides with way too much text.
The mathematics in the course are not explained clearly.
I posted questions and couldn't find any answer.
Unfortunately, this seems to be the approach here...
Too much introduction, not much actual useful stuff.
If the course had the same information and effort as week1 over all 4 weeks i would gave 5 stars, although the assignments are pretty good and I learnt something new, however the assignments are fun but the grader is annoying as the single error output is..... something is wrong... try again?
Primitive and useless
I didn't feel like I had to write anything down.
It provides a broad overview, but materials are not very refined and the course does not provide a good structured approach to the subject.
For the previous courses, I've always used the books and they helped me tremendously to be able to comprehend the material.
not well prepared course
This course was very dissappointing.
There seems to be a significant disconnect between the first three courses (probability, inference, linear regression) and the fourth course (bayesian).
Auto grader reported the grade for the 3rd assignment and said that I have passed the course.
Very through introduction course, very helpful for those who are preparing for PMP exam .
The assignments do not give you any practical methods for actual problem solving.
Not worth the money!
The slides themselves seemed scatter-brained, several times asking questions that are never even answered.
Without getting the textbook and reading it in depth, it is difficult to do well in this class.
Honestly i only finished week 1.
My sympathies to the people who have paid for this course.
This is the worst, most pathetic course I have taken online.
Not good- weak lecturer- repeats himself endlessly- waste of time
Don't expect even well asked questions to be answered at all.
You needed to have a good programming knowledge to make any sense of this course.
I have a hard time focusing on what he is trying to say.
It allows really smalls amounts of infos to be displayed.
The first course in this specialization was really good... course 2 and 3 were also very informative.
This isn't minimal teaching, it's practically nonexistent.
need a sub.
I am aware there are suggested readings, but then why doing this MOOC at all.
As I check out other courses from the same Ruby specialization, the student numbers are getting smaller.
AWFUL monotonous way of talking.
I then took all the quizzes, guessed or surmised the answers, got 100% right, and went on to something more productive.
Once you start the course you will have to focus on Octave rather than on ML topics if you want to do programming exercises.
Running, day dreaming and sleep can help enter diffuse modes and integrate focused learning.
I might was well go to Google to learn Android development.
I don't see how 3D printing is relevant to the majority of people in marketing today.
Study material DOES NOT cover tested material appropriately.
Absolutely U-S-E-L-E-S-S, at least in the free version.
Hopefully the following courses will teach something worthwhile.
Underwhelmed.
Hello,I've completed 5 modules of the specialization successfully with excellent grades.
This course doesn't teach much beyond how to use Galaxy tools.
The professor is just reading (with a bad English).
The teachers doesn't seem to enjoy beeing there..........
If that is how the standard of tutoring is to unfold for UoL Global MBA program (to which this is a foundation), I would seriously reconsider my decision to go for.
I really wanted to learn java on coursera but It seems impossible to me.
I can't even begin to describe how much pain this course gave me.
The code snippets and instructions in the exercise videos are incomplete/have errors and it's impossible to complete the exercises just using those (it's hours of extra work to get things working).
Full of errors in videos and quizzes (which affect final grade), no response from course organizers in the forum to multiple complaints from learners, and extremely thin on content.
I love the main lecture of the statistics.
Very unsatisfied with the course.
Inattentive lectures.
Too simple to be realistic
It is not even clear how the written reviews are graded.
This 5 course program has been described and sold as beginner level, and given my background I should have handily been able to complete it, but that was definitely not the case.
Lots of errors in the lectures and tests, and little to no support from course staff.
Honestly.
Only general information about relevant topics that as well read on wikipedia.
No response from peers or moderators on my queries.
Much better than wasting your time with the lecture videos and assignments.
It was clear that this course was pulled together from a superset of other material, and that it was not checked for consistency or completeness.
Very bad choice for the University of Irvin, California to entrust such an interesting course to such an incompetent and feeble instructor.
This course was a complete joke.
Ended up dropping course because there is no way to get through the quizzes if the information is not covered.
Spent more time trying to understand what was being asked than actually learning.
They don't distinguish between those who completed (but not earned any credentials) and those who didn't.
In my opinion this is a very dumbed down version of an introduction to a data science course (and not a cours in itself).
Badly taught
Please fix it!
Also, as a teacher there is never just one way of doing things there is always multiple ways and being told to do it one way, there way was not appropriate at least for me so, this course although very
OK, but not deep enough for a course called "Responsive Web Design".
The last two weeks cover JavaScript.
It neither states the content nor the effort (for example the hours).
Mr Roth is woefully unprepared for this course, his assessments of the several artists and thinkers he explores are deeply and distressingly flawed - and why would he repeat in a classroom, with unbecoming histrionics, the same lesson he's just delivered from his office
The course really loses focus and its unfortunate that I am now stuck here and cannot continue the entire specialization.
Lectures do not provide enough information to complete the assignments.
)I'd be disappointed with Cousera for foisting this trash if I hadn't taken "Learning How to Learn," much less buggy.
Would disenroll if there was any way to do so.
He can say whatever he think is right.
I would not recommend this one to any paying customer.
The instructors may be knowledgeable, but they had no knack for teaching.
Maturity and duration of the bond comparison with the glass of water is referred to, but was not part of the course.
A statistician or data specialist yes, but a UI designer?Perhaps you could make the course higher level, avoid the indepth R Studio, and make it 3-4 weeks like all of the other courses.
Overall, the teaching material is very short.
This instructor is god-awful, I'm sorry to say.
Skip it at all cost
First of all, most quiz are poorly designed, lots of mistakes.
The last homework si quite a difficult spike.
It has too many bugs.
Worse, many of the sentences don't even make sense and completely incoherrant, even in the written transcript.
Given that Python 2 was replaced by Python 3 some 6 years ago, I'm dismayed to see that this class is teaching Python 2 instead of Python 3.
Also, I'm attending courses on Coursera to learn and quizzes are IMO an essential part of that process, but definitely not essays.
Not at all academically rigorous.
And a pretty small subset with that; the total length of the course is less than most of the MOOCs I have taken have for one week.
They're just a succession of activities that pretend to be creative by making you do things "you wouldn't normally do".
the quality of the lecture is poor - slides are dense and full of bullet points which the professor LITERALLY JUST READS OUT on videos.
a 10 page reading could have make it.
Do I need to start again?
I might recommend the course for undergrad students but not for working adults.
The labs in this course have fundamental flaws which mean they cannot be completed.
Evidently some questions have been deleted and the result is complete nonsense.
Very disappointed in this course.
The course expect students to know Python, to know R, but did not go deep enough to help students understand the insight from social media data.
And it's certainly not mature enough or challenging enough for a university class.
Not suitable for someone from Computer science background looking to learn Python as this can be done with couple of hours of self study.
I ended up having to roll over to the next session 1/2 way through.
Not very well organized course to teach the essential principles of negotiation.
I'm sure there is room for improvement on this course and I hope the instructor does work to improve with the course, but currently the course is disappointing as a learning experience.
I did a provisional submission to see if my answer was right.
lecture too focus on the theory that not very useful on business world.
3 introduction videos each week, and tons of links for reading?Do not want.
The worst course I ever took.
Not enough Video material with good explanations.
Being peer-reviewed doesn't help here -- a total novice can not effectively judge another newbie's work nor give them quality feedback.
Even intermediate musicians seem to struggle with content just because some explanations are not exact or vague.
is a very very boring curse, don't recommend anyone, please for your good at everyboduy else kill this course, don't embarrass yourself and the universities that represents
Where are the lecture videos and other course content?
This is a complete waste of time.
It's too bad - the course description was very promising.
Unfortunately, I believe it is more about advanced statistics then excel.
I have to play it at least 1.75x in order to get through the material and try and stay engaged but I still have a hard time paying attention.
Terrible instruction in the videos and unclear directions.
I went through the slides and I didn't really feel like I learned any actual programming so then to expect to answer questions where you had to program seemed a bit out of left field.
I am glad I didn't pay for the class...
The course was based on a few obvious tips you get from any self-help or management book.
The corresponding book, Python for Informatics, was of little help understanding the assignments.
for other classes (installing R Studio).
It was cheap, but in general, I thought I was going to be more out of this course than I did.
The title implies "Tools for learning" but I didn't get anything useful out of this course.
not worth the money.
Even with reading directly from the slides, the lecturer is overly circumstantial in her explanations if not just outright tangential.
TOO MUCH Peer rating too little hard information
Many sections become an update about UCSD research, not adapted to the audience.
the instructor keeps repeating the same information throughout all the lectures.
There were a lot difficulties with submitting assignments in order to move forward in the course.
Please don't consider my scoring here."
To be honest I don't think this is worth the money.
waste of time and money
The quality of the slides and video and so on was still excellent, but the "teaching" was horrible.
It's terrible if one wants to accomplish the quiz using Garud Iyengar's Notes!!
well now i don't need to review other's work, since calification is already broken, so ty.
The material/information required for the capstone was not covered in the lectures and required considerable additional time and effort to find via online forums and the galaxy pages themselves.
This course need to be reviewed to make it more suitable to various groups of profession as not everyone has the same level of mathematics background.
I think there should either be more concepts thought or they should be covered in more depth.
Quizzes: The quizzes were very weak.
This was not really a course, but a person talking in front of camera some jibber jabber and not much to learn from these talks at all.
No way near the same level as the other courses.
Came from Computer science background and felt that I missed so many terms and concepts that were required for this course
There was an error on one quiz and another assignment was very poorly explained, leading to many feeling like we lost marks due to not knowing exactly what was expected of us.
If you're more advanced, it may be easier to find and understand the differences between the video and the spreadsheets, but the whole point of this class is that it is for beginners.
The subject really interesting, and I have been studying for a while in my Master's and PhD in engineering, so I could understand the bulk of the course.
In fact, this is an inconsistent attempt of re-implementing previous FRP course from the same authors.
Although the Capstone Project Assignment itself is EXCELLENT, the peer grading rubric is not.
Awful!
Content needs to be updated
It needs to be deeper and more robust if this course wants to stand out, right now is not.
Really wanted to take this class.
This is a high school public service announcement, not a university course; not what I'd expect from Stanford or Coursera.
After a couple weeks it's looking like a waste of money.
You're watching a fundamentally disconnected series of mostly ad-hoc discussions of vague concepts.
worst course forever
I learned a lot through my own efforts and through the efforts of students who bothered to post in the forums.
There seems to be a bug in the way at least one quiz question is set up.
On the final assignment you can modify the simulation step where it makes things run in "real time".
Class is incredibly slow and does way, way too much simple addition, subtraction, and multiplication to prove extremely basic points for a calculus course.
From a purely certificate based perspective, the only requirement to complete the course are completely the quizzes.
I an very disappointed that DUKE hits your up for $79 just to grade the fist quiz (which should cost them $0).
This course starts off interesting and then just gets absurd.
It is a very small introduction to swift, while the last assignment expects you to be rather fluent in programming using swift.
No ppt's are given, so all links presented in the video's cannot be viewed.
Quizzes are based upon old packages, so incorrect answers are provided.
No replies at discussion board from TA"s or instructors.
In fact, lots of R task can be replaced with Python, so the course could be designed in a much better way that students do not always switch between two programming environments.
The quizzes are either out-of-order or expect you to do a lot of research on your own beyond the class notes and topics.
The questions doesn't reflect the material.
A lot of self study using the guides provided by apple and other sources is needed to successfully complete this course.
Furthermore the video's indicate a lack of preparedness on part of the instructors as a lot of sentences are cut of halfway , then started a new with a new goal.
The instructor's videos have shown me very little of what I need to understand the concepts.
The case given is pertaining exclusively to the North American market.
I'm giving just a single star.
The Matlab assignments were not too difficult, but were relevant enough to the material to be acceptable.
As I highlighted already it took me 8 hours with a professional to install Pentaho... for what?
It would be better to slice it in many exercises associated with each week.
Work should have been better spread out.
I made it to week three before I could no longer keep listening to Professor Amar drone on and turn a 10 minute lecture into a 25 minute lecture with filler words, tangents and lack of structure.
I´m sure the teachers put a lot of effort in doing the course , there is a lot subjects presented but I definitely suggest a change in the presentation to start then connect and fully explain examples.
They were talking a lot and everything was going over my head, the reason was there were not visual prompt for the examples, specifically in the last week.
I'm currently reading Head First Android Development and it is exactly what I needed to grasp basic concepts as well get my bearings in the Android world.
A weaker version of "Fundamentals of Graphic Design" with way too much overlap.
At least don't pay any money.
Really badly organised.
Makes one wonder: If I need to solicit others' guidance to complete your tests, why am I paying for your guidance in the first place?
No Open Source Libraries, this course is not educational; it is a sales pitch to use their expensive software.
1) Not worth the money and time.
Don't expect to know or understand java with this course, no practical or step by step example in this course.
Good efford, good content, just wrong methodology for online training for 2015.
Quizzes contain material never mentioned during lessons.
You can pass all of then without watching a single video or lecture.
The assignments are interesting but the way of grading them are bad designed and subjective.
Sad, I passed this course without trouble but made me stop wanting to get the full specialization.
Spartans!
Potential students should save their money and read the relevant Wikipedia pages.
The condition is to focus each week to a topic.2.
More clarity is needed in formulating questions, since different pages have different values for the same data sets (even on the same website such as the World Bank indicator datasets) and it will be difficult for students to get the right answers.
I don't know if it is a language barrier or what but I feel that I didn't have a chance to study more to get a better score.
In MOOC instructional design, you normally design short videos because the attention span of an online learner is tends to be much shorter than an in-person university student.
It doesn't seem like a lot of effort went into course planning and creation.
Finally, I shall neither modify nor remove my previous comments on the examples used by the author.
Please notice that Coursera still gets all my confidence about the usefulness and the quality of their proposed courses.
Really bad explanation no code explain they left you on your own i'ts supposed to teach you not to left you undestand nothing they just teach components but the real thing the progaming is undeground no one knows that kinda weird :(
Lecture presentation is not very engaging, almost seems like the female instructor was forced to stand in front of a camera and read note cards.
No good without the missing course and capstone projects
material was good but it doesn't tell you to pay for the course until you take the quiz
Doesn't really distinguish between users without serious problems & addicts (which I believe amplifies gateway effects & experimentation once people meet users who aren't brain damaged or addicts).
Sorry about that, but there are better courses on the Internet than this one.
It seems the instructor Jack Wu didn't prepare the course material.
In the end, it seems like a big opportunity of delivering a marketing campaign by the instructors then otherwise.
I definitely will not spend time and money on the other courses of this specialization.
I wish this course was for free with the assignments!
Very confusing course, unclear example, too theoretical (very limited relevancy to business questions)Also, presentation format could be improved (tables are not intuitive to read/understand)
If not for specialization that I am aiming for, I would never take it.
Half of the links to external readings and videos did not work, which is the reason I did not complete the course.
The topics would deserve that they are presented in a way that they can be understood by a wide audience.
I started this course with high hopes, bailed after the third quiz as I wasn't learning anything except how to pass the quiz.
First time I gave 1 star.
The teacher mostly reads notes from his iPad without a proper presentation or some kind of text.
I'm surprised that Coursera allows this tripe on their website.
Spent more time frustrated with trick questions on quizzes than actually learning something.
Cannot believe UCI have just very short course, compared to san diegi/Duke/Virginia/Copnehagan who have courses worthing thousands of dollars for free as compared to this one.
I am not a programmer, though in college I learned C, C++, and used MATLAB a fair amount.
This required nearly no effort and is probably of little value in the real world.
Also from Europe virtual machine use is just killing my computer and I end up spending more time crashing and restarting my pc than working on the course.
repetitive content with other MOMA courses (seeing thru pictures)??
If you expect to learn from this course, dont bother they mostly refer you to w3schools.
com.
The worst course of this certificate.
I personally did not find it constructive enough to spend money on.
It is way too general and basic.
Week 2 is an unreasonably difficult jump from Week 1.
Do the problem sets for practice.
Definitely they can do a much better job, despite there're many improvements compared to the first course.
There is even less explanation of real-world applications, examples, and demonstration.
The course staff is not that helpful.
God only knows if anything has been received or credited.
One "instructor" Ms Mayer simply reads the slides, line by line.
would have prefered to have more interaction with the instructors on the assignment atleast.
I did a google search, and found almost all of the analytical charts he presented, readily available on the internet.
Interesting to say the leastWhy cant i access my certificate.
The one star is for the handouts (I believe pulled from other websites but pointed to by this course) - these have been useful.
It was too difficult and unfair.
I'm unimpressed with the quality of the material and uninspired by the professor's video presentations.
The video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes, as they are primarily theory and background.
Content is very weak, sounds that are used very annoying...
There was nothing about the structure and forms of the strong quartet, just "here's a good one to listen to."
weather its an act of self-interests or not, I don't really care.
My expectations were different
I suggest all "peers" keep in mind we are here to learn not to be judge so critically.
i'm sorry, it's a reputable school and who the hell am I, but one man's opinion: rethink how you go about introducing the newbie to graphic design as it's applicable to the real world.
If you can learn from essentially listening to a pod cast and reading unix type manual pages, then this course is for you!
They are given in a monotone, bored tone that will drive you insane.
Overall, this course seems more like it was hastily slapped together, without much thought, and then never looked at again.
Very boring presentation of the material
I would not recommend this iOS specialization to anyone.
I have paid in full but I don't have the Digital Marketing Specialisation Certificate.
Confused, gained nothing from the lectures.
Just read it through.
Since the tips are so critical to understanding and completing the assignments, I think Al Warren's tips should be incorporated as part of the core course.
That means slightly more dynamic lectures, more involved assignments.
shame you have to pay for this course although the content is good
Never received a certificate or a grade.
Unlike the previous sections, this section assumes that one knows Java and its syntax beforehand.
No significant instruction/teaching provided.
Highly biased and controversial statements by those in videos are taken as fact without any attempt to question it.
The first three weeks of this course is ok.
The preparation of the course is poor, there is no direction, a lot of errors using playground and the instructors hesitate and doubt all the time during the recording of the screen.
It does cover GUI software like Rstudio, which is ignored for the rest of the course.
The certificate has a worthless appearance.
Im not finishing it since in the test are missing a lot of sounds ..............
I paid the course and the course seem to be no longer supported, I tried without success to switch session , in summary : You paid and don't get to follow the course, incredible :-( ....... !
It is not a recommended course, when they explain something they assume that we are expert and we know all what they are talking about, they need to have statistics experts which is not mentioned in course prerequisite.================I recommend to review the material and to review the purpose of this course
Definetly not a good course to get a verified certificate
Then he proceeds to assign problems that don't really cover what the slides, lectures, or examples were on.
It is only texts and archive videos.....
Youtube would have done the same.
This course "talks" about a really important subject.
Because I consider it a trick to lure someone into an interesting course and then making it impossible to finish it in the given timeframe.
However, the biggest challenge and disappointment was the capstone.
Very little of use in this course.
(ii) Lectures are very mathematical but proofs, intuition and good problem sets are all missing.
I expected it would provide a background on the rather than just run a code and show the results.
The "Soul Beliefs" course seems to try presenting things in an unbiased manner yet they cannot hide their bias.
I wanted tips on weaning if you're still nursing a toddler...
Put in mini-quizzes in the middle of videos, to keep the student aware of how they are doing in short increments.
I wanted to learn more details, specially in depth about each type of the 5 cancers from the basics to clinical.
I appreciate it.
Only the most basic of instructions for R, which are bland and easily read in the documentation or other free resources.
As it turns out, all she does is read from the slides!
The slides are very difficult to follow.
A university is meant to teach the whole story, and have a truthful account of facts.
Many videos lacked associated pdf slides so confusing to watch.
I find it doubtful that a true beginner would fare well in this course.
Graded assignments require a lot of self-education.
If the course wasn't structured around using Dato, it would be a lot simpler and a easier to complete the assignments.
The entire course can be reduced to 3 pages of notes.
This seems to be part of an introductory specialization to emerging technologies.
I had to go to outside sources to make sense of what the videos were discussing, which I felt like defeats the purpose.
Here are my reasons.
Actually I did not complete the course at all.
Definitely not a course for a beginners, very confusing.
You know the code you need to write, but you don't get what are you doing ... Where do these formulas come from?
However, Part 3 includes six calculation questions unrelated to the project to be submitted in Parts 1 and 2.4- The forms of putting an answer are unclear, although it mentions how to put a percentage and two decimal points.5- Peer assessment take ages and is unnecessary.6- Discussion forums are deserted islands where no professional staff interaction is given.
I've stopped continuing this specialization and I strongly recommend others not to waste their time on it.
i can't start every quiz in week 4.
I did not know what was going on and I have to stop.
No moderator or the faculty replies to your queries.
Lots of bugs
The material and the lecture is not so engaging.
But to do this all the time is a bit too much and therefore inefficient.
Unfortunately, without a doubt, the worst und most uninformative course I've ever taken.
This course should really be called BASICS of healthy cooking or for people with unhealthy habits.
All assignments giving you more insight on your personality had to be purchased.
The problem is, there's very little instructions or support, so it feels like a classroom where the instructor said "do whatever you want" and walks out of the door.
Each course in itself was aright and I learned new things.
Dont we all need help from time to time.
Though one would expect to learn from the assignments and mistakes he or she makes during it.
This is such an unfortunate course to have as a requirement to complete the Specialisation, and especially the final hurdle to get into the Capstone.
The final assignment asked you to do things you hadn't been taught.
Neither Coursera, the instructor or any moderator ever responded.
Disappointing.
Shame on the University of Maryland, College Park.
I drop at the beginning of the Javascript, before Javascript, everything is good, after Javascript, "What are they talking about"?
I did not enjoy grading others without knowing if I was right.
straight away code snippets are pasted.
The presentation was probably the worst part of the course: It was extremely boring and made it hard to get through the videos.
I didn't expect much practical parts in the course, but there was even less than what I expected: What was described as setting up a hadoop cluster consisted of downloading a preconfigured VM image and running it, and then typing in a couple of commands that were provided to you.
How can you put a 30 minute video for a class?
I spent many hours but still couldn't get solve the assignment.
Even before i can understand the first line.
kind of okay but...
I understand that these lectures were filmed before last summer's shock result in the EU referendum, but - honestly - would it have killed Professor Gearey to have discussed the context and possible implications of the referendum?
A little devoid of depth.
Having to type "-1*1+11" instead of "-i+11" (and you better not have any leading or lagging spaces!!)
Out of the dozen or more courses here that I have taken, this one ranks at the bottom.
It would have been beneficial to see how these fundamental building blocks could be used in real life design.
Highly unethical practice in my opinion.
The surveys are stupid too.
It doesn't meet my expectations.
It felt like students were running the whole show and discussion forums.
I had to give up because I don't have time to be bogged down like this.
The students' comments and discussion would be useful if they can be accessed from within each lesson.
I'm sorry, but I have taken many courses on Coursera and this is, without a doubt, the absolute worst.
if you've done that, there's a very big change that you already know about 90%-95% of the techniques presented in thous course.
Need English Version Please
Most of the effort in the creation of this course seems to have gone into the visual and acoustic effects of the slides.
I understand that in order to maintain such a big structure is expensive; however it wasn't clear to me from the beginning that I have to pay to unlock the 2nd module courses.
When you have a course that is such a short time frame, you really need to be providing assistance in a timely manner.
I could not, in any good faith, recommend anyone take this course in the future - which is a little saddening.
pathetic
Anybody can tell me what an acronym stands for - I want to know what these features actually do, how they work, how they're developed.
I have no desire to upgrade to the whole package for this course.
It needs work.
This is a totally theoretical course.
Minimal video efforts, not enough content, and long readings.
At one point, it even links to 6 articles on another website (and that's in the quiz as well).
There is some absurd voice in between.
It seems like it is strictly scripted, the instructor looks like she's reading the material.
Data Camp's free R course has been much more helpful for me than this.
The person is not able to construct a sentence without denial and course has really little information, but lots of empty talking.
Feels like this course could be merge with the first or the third course.
They taught NOTHING!
They never worked with something like that!
Coward.
Buddhist meditation is a profoundly beautiful tradition but there is no beating heart here.
it would have been a good opportunity to explore this had it been possible to download Unity oh well those who can do those who can't resume their day to day life packing boxes.
Too many links to outside stuff.
The lectures will not, however, aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments.
Its a very superficial course.
There is a lot of fluff in this course and at the same time it assumes that you have knowledge and skills that are not covered in this course or in the previous two (e.
g.
In both cases, move on.
Ultimately the student has to visit other web sites and youtube to actual learn the expected material.
Bad teacher.
I wasted too much time on this already.
The assignments require too much research outside what is covered in the videos.
Very low level , im sorry but this cant be even considered a good intro to HTML,CSS im going to stop wasting my time watching this.
no chllange in the assignments or questions , + more of an overview of the basics then the basics ..
Unfortunately on the whole I was very disappointed with this class.
I have taken numerous courses from Harvard and Johns Hopkins, and none of them compare in quality of execution of the first three Duke courses in this series.
And then there was Bayesian Statistics: much of the "instruction" in this course was truly awful.
This seems to be a view reflected elsewhere.
When she cant explain sheo covers it up with attitude words or skips quickly.
The accent of the teacher is horrible (i'm not an english-native speaking person so it's hard for me to follow english when badly spoken, so i cut off the sound and only read the subtitles.
Not a single practical part, soo much talk and write.
Sorry would not share the course with friends, 190€ is too much for what I have just learned.
The professors didn't want to spend time preparing good material, from my point of view, the preparation is very poor.
The course is more oriented to teach you to be a "data monkey".
It might have been ok if they had included the iOS parts also, but charging 70 EUR for the first part alone is grossly overpriced.
Don't know how to apply the statistics and excel formula in real world situation.
Peer to peer assignments are really slow and due time dependent.
This is not for beginners at all.
Did the first week videos and Lectures.
This course is one of the few lesser courses I've seen on Coursera, since the course instructor has shown little commitment to course material preparation compared to other course instructors.
However, I left the course feeling more frustrated than ever.
All in all, it was consistent with the first course in this "specialization".
Again, very disappointing.
They r repeating the same thing in all the videos.
I'm sorry to say this Course is really boring, poor in resources and I'm sorry to say this but it's the worse Coursera Course I've attended .
I really don't see how this class can actually teach you to build a robust high-quality app.
This should have been the 1st week of an actual class.
This course is too much doggy!
Lacked going in depth.
It discouraged me from pursuing the rest of the specialisation.
I am extremely dissatisfied with Coursera and this course but especially the mentors and their lack of mentoring.
really bad!
I find the week 6 of this course completely irrelevant.
Large gaps exist: explanations of syntax and conceptualization of how the data flows seem incomplete.
I would prefer a a large scale machine learning capstone where we could make models and it would fit better to real life situation!
The execution is extremely poor--the short quizzes often do not emphasize the elements focused upon in the video OR ask questions addressed in the next video (not the one just viewed) OR address issues that are not raised at all in this particular course (but issues from other courses in the specialization).
The tutorials to get this software often involve "You need this, but so save time we're going to skip showing you how to get it.
"Do as I say, not as I do" seems to be the prevailing MO.
But somehow I expect some better understanding of more aspects of languages.
No one is required to give actual feedback and a lot of the assignments were written by students in horrendous English, but that is not to be considered.
This course was nothing like true Tibetan Buddhism which is my religion !
I am not very happy with this course.
This actually does not help to build a quadcopter from the scratch.
Need to record the sessions again with more confidence and less errors
Seriously, so boring!2) There is a high degree of subjectivity in grading essays (peer reviews)This course can benefit from:1) Clearer introduction of concepts using pictures and animations, as well as cutting out the repetitiveness (and the assault of the jargonaut)2) A better approach to grading that places importance on concepts instead of key words (jargon)
Some real-world examples which point out typical mistakes or give useful hints would be welcome in the first three weeks as well.
The transcriptions into English are incomplete, so understand this course is very very complicated.
I do not recommend it at all.
In general, the holistic experience of this course was disappointing and frankly, I would not recommended it unless you have a strong enough math background or are a glutton for punishment.
JavaScript is not Java.
The videos have very little to do with tests
this was thefirst course i payed for and unfortunately the worst expierience.
lack of content beyond the stuff in the available simple swift tutorials andfrom an eduucational pint of view afwully if at all preparedits as shame that i cannot give this "course" ZERO stars which it deserves!i should have checked the very negative feedback of the former participants before bying iti will be much MUCH more alert regarding content on coursera from now on
It said it was subtitled into English but that's only the first video...
Paying for course just to learn how to loop and make if else statements...
Otherwise, would-be students should just buy an R For Dummies book, and use materials elsewhere.
Though the lectures are understandable, but the readings are comparable but unrelated to the material in the lectures.
He is literally reading out the content on each slide.
After that it's unbearably boring.
It is also frustrating that when I raised these concerns in the weekly discussion forum, I received replies from a volunteer moderator which were so badly written as to be almost unintelligible.
At some points I struggled to understand the point the lessons were trying to make.
Not being allowed to submit quizzes without paying for the course - I am withdrawing from the course and any other Coursera courses where this is the policy - I will enrol in other free online course sites where the are "free".
It's better to watch the Youtube videos to understand the concepts.
Certainly not worth paying for this course, only talks about how to install the tools.
Not able to take quizzes when you try to take the course for free.
This college doesn't spend much effort to structure this course - just putting short videos (less than 10mins in total per a week) and external references (which someone else wrote).
The most boring course i have ever done in my life... Soporific course, Content interesting, but professor is just reading slides, with reading mistakes every 2-3 words.
How about: "Cut!
The subject matter for this course is very, very interesting!
That's why I go MOOC.
The imposed 8-hour period between attempts at the quizzes only hindered my progress.
and OWASP material.
At this point it is clear that continuing the course is not going to help me in the way I would expect it from a course.
What's the point of the class if I can't get my questions answered?
If you need help, pause the videos and try the code out yourself.
Seriously though, a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it.
And also why should you pay for a course where you learn anyway only ba your own.
Pick any intersting topic you would like to work on and invest the time in this instead of paying for this Capstone without any support form Coursera, JHU or SwiftKey.
This is a very badly adjusted curse for the Coursera frame - I've encountered several quiz questions where I was supposed to write an answer in, but this option was not activated for me.
Moreover, this course is dramatically prolonged - while the information provided can be easily put into 1-2 days, a week the most, it is somehow is stretched into 5 weeks.
The organization, insofar as "here is a list of stuff I'll be teaching" makes sense.
I cant recommend it to anyone who is serious about learning JS HTML or CSS.
I wouldn't recommend this course to my worst enemy.
It's very simple presentation for the topic.
If Peking University believes this is their best - I'll not be taking another course with them.
I won't be taking any other courses from this school if this course was an indication of quality.
I hope part 5/5 improves.
The fact that the hoax (by now debunked) of the "positivity ratio" and the "attractors of happiness" are still in the course and presented as fact is a big red flag.
In result i feel that lector read this material not to teach people, but just to read it.
The professor also needs to speak a little slower for people to follow.
No clue where the problem come from.
i will not pay for this specialization.
For free it is passable, but had I payed I would sincerely regret itPart 2 is better, but still changing thoughts midway in a sentence
It does not meet Coursera's high standards.
Very basic for the cost it represents, it doesn't really provide information beyond what one could find on a simple review on the first page of Google.
Questions do not have relation with lectures.
I also think that the ambiguous requirements exercise is the most important of the course, and the exercise missed the mark.
I would suggest you structure that exercise as a dialogue, where a PM is working with the customer to elicit requirements, and not give us a big long wish-list of functionality.
I do not agree at all with this view.
Should you happen to agree with this view, the Course is well explained and presented well.
When one needs to read the english subtitles to understand the english the professor is speaking, it becomes inherently difficult in an online course.
Some of the information is badly outdated like the electric vehicle driving range and hybrid vehicles only able to drive a mile with ou
I also had no kind of communication with instructors, TAs, or other student for help.
I've taken several statistics, data science, and R courses.
Dropped out after a week and half
!I cancel my participation
Simple & Clear , Handsome teacher!
I got to the final assignment and had no clue what to do if you.
The guides show how to get started on a Mac.
I could learn the interview skls anywhere.
It's a mere half an hour a week of advice we should all already know, if we are interested in nutrition.
I am quitting this course, unfortunately it's a waste of time.
The topic is good though.
I am really unhappy with this course.
Also, there are many errors in the videos that should be corrected.
and there is no way to rate a bad reviewer so they get away with it.
the other courses in the specialisation are great, but this one gives very little in the way of tuition and relies on the whole on peers, which for me didn't work out too well
Perhaps not the kind of course you are looking for in replacement of a serious college-level class that surveys the book.
Two and a half days into the course not a single moderator has answered a question in the forums and I can't find a way to contact Coursera about this problem.
I am very disappointed.
Waste of time and money.
Cannot understand the diction..
There are major jumps in the difficulty of material that are completely unnecessary.
What Bullshit!
Ones or twice is okay.
Another point is R - this course doesn't really teach bayesian stats with R. It teaches how to call one-liners like bayes_inference (from package statsr) or bas.
lm (from package BAS) instead of lm.
If someone is going to dump the whole of Ruby on me in 1 week I don't need the class, I can buy a book and get the same experience.
That's it.
I was very much looking forward to this course.
There is no direct way to contact the faculty, if you are stuck on any assignments.
This course is the worst course that I have taken so far.
It is explained in an understandable way and examples provide a good insight.
The link to down
The first two or three videos have an immense amount of repetition: same sentence/content repeated 2-3 times in a different manner.
She also places herself directly in front of the camera blocking a clear view of everything - poor video skills.
For comparison, you can easily get more useful information about Tableau from the 4 minute long "Getting started" video on the Tableau website than from this course.
Not for beginners unless you are willing to invest a significant amount of time with outside sources, beyond what is stated as needed to complete the course.
Not the type of knowledge I thought I would get
Too base for experienced people, not enough fundamental for beginners.
After 2 weeks didn't find any useful information, it also very boring, so recommend to see video on 1.25 -1.5 speed.
The course need to be significantly changed:1. Who are the target audience2.
I wouldn't recommend this course at all.
Good lectures, but the R-lab is horrible.
Even from the early week's lectures we learned about semantics, and how simple mistyping could lead to programming errors, so I wrongly assumed the mentors would understand that some of us would probably make simple errors.
Only links to websites.
I am very disappointed and have lost all my money for nothing.
The professor talked about the idea of data analysis without ever discussing how to actually perform data analysis.
More practical application would be helpful in solidifying knowledge.
Too many lectures, specialized audience with huge competition, not accessible by novices of philosophy and only assessed through a single peer-reviewed assignment-essay.
I learned very little from the class.
very basic overview.
The staff is completely absent in the recent discussion forums, it seems they have abandoned the course few months ago.
You have your assignments evaluated by only one peer, and that doesn't protect your final grade from wrong evaluations.
Very slow pace; info could've been distilled into less than half the lectures (I completed the '7 weeks' in 3 days).
Just garbage.
If I could give this course a lower score, I would.
No teachers involve the process.
Poor support from them - the coursera team tried to help but obviously in vain.
The entire course was not paced well.
The illustrations are also very boring...
very bad course
pure information, a lot of "w
Terrible course.... the instructor just read out of the power point.
The examples were awesome and the tests were reasonable, quite the opposite to this course.
Also, Eclipse is so much better than BlueJ in many ways, also into learning...
And there's more things that must be improved, but no time and no money.
I'm very dissapointed to this course and Duke Univeristy.
less than 20 minutes per week.
horrible
You have to read a lot, Actually, this course doesn't look like as others Coursera's courses and I don't recommend it.
(From a beginner programmer's view).
Sometimes the course assumes a good level in computer science and then 2 minutes later it explains how to do a decimal to binary conversion!
Very US centered and assignment not well connected to the lecture
Learned very little.
I entered the course expecting to learn about Raspberry pi and Python and got nothing our of it!
Course is quite unreliable.
Instructor is distracting in manner in which he presents information - overemphasizes acting over content.
This is definitely a course for someone that has finished a higher degree.
Very weak presentation.
It's near impossible to follow along.
I have since started the free Stanford course taught by a co-founder of coursera, and it is MUCH better!
I'm dropping out.
Take two.
There's a lot of knowledge missed out from lectures while being expected from the student in the quizzes.
Lecturers themselves have a very vague understanding of how java works and how to code in real life.
not on topic, not honest, and dogmatic.
also the auto emails continue after unsubscribing from the course.
I know that the submissions I peer reviewed were quite poor, but the grading criteria that we need to follow as reviewers is quite vague and not very thorough.
Very disappointing.
Requires MATLAB.
It feels like the instructor is just reading out from some material.
It's more like a heap of formulas thrown together and what the teacher do in this course is just to read them.
I think everbody will agree, that the earth for example isn't a closed system.
In the beginning they tell you you should be critical about everything new you hear or get taught.
Not very practical.
To lock a quiz for payment is mean.
Extremely light on information, no discussion forums.
The course would urgently need re-recording.
Where is the gist of what they are saying in so many words?
They don't explain the concepts clearly, the quizzes ambiguously ask things not seen in the videos and the instructor introduces equations without further explanation.
I ended up leaving the course during week three after issues with a quiz that was described in the forums as "impossible."
For practice purpose just take the free version, paid version is not worth taking, as you will not get any additional guidance or support to do assignments when stuck.
Not happy with this course.
I wouldn't give a star for this course; materials are prosaic (wordy); professors have not designed a truly high-tech course with automated grading; they want peers to grade each other - I don't like this euphemism, which is equivalent to the blind leading the blind; I do not want to spend my energy correcting other peoples' programming assignments; I want to spend the time thinking about programming and working on my own programs - the concept of collaboration is false - everyone wants to develop their own stuff not share with others so the premise of the course is inaccurate; also, the course has many long-winded texts of little use to the student; this is a course more about indoctrination in a legacy system than it is a course to liberate the mind through computers; while the content is interesting I am completely turned off by the amount of time I have to devote to commenting on other peoples' stuff - I am not a teacher - that is the teacher's job not my job - also, I do not like the condescension and clownishness of the profs in this course - I do not need to be entertained and all the talk about Monty Python, one of the corniest programs on TV trivializes the material - a no-nonsense, MIT type course is preferable - this is a course that I would avoid from the logistical perspective, although I will follow the material side of the course because it has substantial content and that includes the specialization - hello teachers in the course - automate the grading and remove all of the peer evaluations and start offering authentic instruction, not lazy instruction of students teaching students - the approach is typical of all legacy-oriented courses - the same goes for the Severance course at the University of Michigan - if the Rice course is supposed to instill interest in Rice University, this offering turns me away from Rice because one realizes that Rice is too legacy-oriented in its approach, same old, same old.
Stay clear, there are free alternatives out there
Did not like the course, complicated concepts and poor representation.
In compare with first course of this specialization study materials are too few.
The part with the Javascript is a real horror for beginners and even challenging for some newly programmers!
The course starts with a short introduction on the topic of usability and user experience.
The quiz questions are totally unrelated from the lessons.
I hardly doubt that anyone learns something except how certain practices are called.
Paid for the course and never took it.
It should be compressed to 1-2 hours and added as an _optional prerequisite_ to other courses in this specialization.
I'm quite disappointed about this course and can not recommend it.
Had high hopes when I joined the course.
Just boring lectures.
After 30 minutes I was finish with the course.
The course is very superficial.
Professor Amar is very knowledgeable about the Constitution and I don't doubt his credentials or accomplishments.
The most of the materials have only percentages, and small details on history.
Too many animal mistreatment clips were shown, also some gross misstatements of biological-scientific truths and widely held facts.
It was almost as if someone took already prepared slides from a course and just kind of mashed them with a very little bit of video to make an "online" course.
Multiple testing of data is a sign of poor experimental design and should be avoided, not adjusted for.
Honestly, I'm very disappointed with this course.
This course is very hard to follow and not interactive at all.
The gentleman that drills his own cavities in his home workshop was most annoying and pointless.
All you get is a basic knowledge about All Things Cyber™.
The recommended readings are all over the place, the video captions look like they're just a basic speech recognition and like nobody actually proof read them.
Several hours of extensive research yields no usable data which could provide a logical direction to the project.
Lesson 1 - no longer available via PCLesson 1 no longer exist to do via PC on internet.
Sugggested .
It is obvious that the instructor has abandoned this course.
It should not be included in the Specialization.
There were also no practice exercises, no posting of pieces of illustrative code, and hence, no way to actually get good at programming in Swift (unless it's self directed, in which case - why bother with the formality of taking a course on Coursera?
This course is absolute garbage.
The lecture is very fast and not covering all the things being asked in the assignment...
I want to withdraw from this stupid course - it sucks.
The slides don't make much sense and a lot of times I have to research stuff again on other websites to actually get the point.
If this class is not part of the certificate specialization, i wouldn't even pay for this course.
Course could have earn my stars.
Money, money, money is not the way to go.
Possibly the least well structured class ever.
I felt like I had been dropped down on Mars.
Unforyunately all the information is rather basic, most of the knowledge provided is intuitively understandable.
Discussion forums are left unanswered by the teaching staff - or if they reply, they do it in a very negligent manner.
There was no engagement between the course instructors and students at all.
The introduction is great.
bad useless garbage,this is the most bad online course i've take,just waste time
Almost more than half of students failed this course because of it.
make the other courses free
There's no point in auditing the course since you don't get access to the answers
Please reduce no of clicks that a user has to make to submit the reviews.
this is terrible
This seemed more appropriate for a startup, and most of the content was rudimentary
I would be more interested to know about the algorithm than a huge lecture on who is Djikstra, and also would like to have some exercise to implement the same and realise.
I suggest to include more and clearer examples to solve problems.
I never learned why anything happened.
The lectures themselves are little more than the material being read directly off the slides by an individual with a poor grasp on the English language.
Everything in this revolves around a tool graphlab create.
Much more policy-driven.
Irritating!
This is not the first time I did installation of complicated code in unix and I know by heart this can be cumbersome sometimes.
But why doing this for a simple programming assignment.
This feels more a like a sales pitch for Copyblogger than an actual course.
Don't be fooled by how easy the first weeks assignment is for the second course of this specialization.
The mentors in the forum tried their best but even they had to admit the grading system was riddled with errors.
These project exams should be a combination of automated programming tasks, like the kind you find on HackerRank or Codeforces and peer assessment based projects that asks students to evaluate the readability of each others code.
I am very surpirsed that getting the certificate for this course costs the same (in $) than getting the certificate of the Introduction to Principles of Game Design.
System indicates submissions were successfully submitted.
Check out Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra, Sebastian Thrun's Artificial Intelligence for Robotics and Andrew Ng's Machine Learning for examples of good derivations of mathematically sophisticated material.
Very bad explanation too boring lectures
Its very brief and not profound.
This more advices and not scientifically oriented.
If you don't know statistics you won't learn it here.
It's a very dry course.
Muy poca información.
Very few information.
They were definitely more helpful than the slide show, but I still felt like they would teach you how to add then ask you to multiply.
So in general my recommendation would be not to take the course unless you have a fairly solid understand of programming, otherwise you will do what I did and just wasted $50.
I feel like the materials itself is not sufficient for entry level, and will actually confuse some of the learners.
I was planning on going for the PR for Digital Media Certification, but I can't handle another course like this.
I honestly don't know why I bothered to continue torturing myself as long as I did.
John Holbo makes grasping Plato more complicated than it needs to be.
A waste of time.
Peer-grading is too subjective and students use their opinions as opposed to rubrics for grading, and often do not read all the material prior to assigning a score.
Week 1 is only a welcome lecture!!
I never thought I would have to rate it this bad.
i.

This psychiatric lady also seems to be sexits.
Sorry to say that this is the worst Coursera Course I have ever taken, and I've taken quite a few.
The videos are just verbatim repetition of what is there in the book.
Many people don't have a ton of extra money to throw away on garbage, and you are selling a defective product.
I prefer to use R to do the modeling things, while this course should talk more about pivot tables and existing useful financial functions which advantage over other statistical tools.
I spent over 15 hrs trying to complete week 2's assignment and still could not finish.
This doesn't happen in any of the other courses I've taken/I'm taking
Are you a struggling programmer?
Stop being seemingly arrogant.
I'm also not sure why, if auditing, we can't submit and see how we're doing on the learning.
He speaks too fast without much clarity, and worst of all, i can tell most of the time he reads from the scripts without really conveying much knowledge about the contents.
What's the point?
The lecture is too long and information value is very low.
I thought that this course was going to be as enjoyable as Dr. Chuck's Python for Everyone given that both instructors are from the same institution, and both courses belong to similarly named specializations, that is "...
For Everyone", but I ended up disappointed.
Good introduction to the galaxy tool.
If you do not already know java (or at least have some experience with it) I would NOT recommend this class.
Example code in quizzes is not complete.
I can't finish the friggin' course.
I guess im fortunate that i have already studied those courses from external sources before i started here.
one of the instructors speaks quite fast with alot of anxiety making it quite difficult to understand without repeating the video.
I am shocked and disgusted.
You have chanse to understand HTML and CSS, but Js .
If there is too great a sacrifice to productivity for the sake of security, then people will find a way around any security mechanisms in place.
I suppose that we should have some basic knowledge of data visualization before this course.
very pedantic.
The reason I was able to understand about the SQL part is because I already know.
Plenty of room for improvement.
But I managed to run a few analyses with some workarounds.
I expected to have more hands-on working with the Hadoop ecosystem rather than this course's focus on background that really does not help one to become productive.
This course clearly has an agenda.
I need to learn about cost-per-click, impressions, ROI on ad spend - that sort of thing.
Shame that it was not possible to progress with this course without using graphlab which the creator of this course himself created.
The lectures barely touch on the topics being taught, you are expected to go learn on your own.
It is not free (you get a one year licence) and hides all the action from the user.
You may learn, in the process of a few days, how to create a website, but not "how to create a website in a weekend".
The explanations of the algorithms and concepts was clear and easy to understand.
Hands-on instructions and a very practical knowledge.
1- Almost no content , all just general knowledge2- the instructor was very hard to follow, his intonation is totally off and the sentences are broken so you can't connect the thoughts together.3- There was no forum and thus no interaction.
However, in this course, even though the video is short, it is really 5-10 times longer because they speed over the equations and teaching so fast that you have to pause and replay and rewind and replay several times while trying it yourself.
I haven't found any lecture that present the knowledge as the Ivy league University as Yale.
its a fail
The lecturers try to keep the instructions basic and pedagogical.
the ability to self-check the weeks passed should be provided otherwise.
The assignments for peer-grading are unnerving - how should peers grade my weight-goals?
It's format needs a good narrator not based on stupid commercials.
The only redeeming part about this course is that behavioral economics is honestly compelling, despite the shortcomings pointed out.
Because I am 2.5 points short or so, I have to take this same course for the next round session for the third time, wait it it reaches week 4, resubmit my analysis that is now edited for 4 times.
Observation of the video showing her teaching is terrible.
The lectures are very good, but the course administrators forgot to proof read the quizzes.
This is basically just one giant commercial for the web site.
Also, every time a "checkpoint" question is supposed to pop up, nothing happens.
Very horrible and boring course, poorly designed and the teachers can't even speak properly.
It is not laid out in a format that I, a native English speaker, understood.
It does not teach you but just excitedly shows commonly known facts.
There are better ways to invest your time.
Instructor is not clear and too fast!
Even though I paid for 2 broken, un-proofread, time wasting courses.
It is completely unnecessary as the courses are labeled on the left side of the screen.
I hope the next classes are more up-to-date.
Even the answers to quizzes seemed extremely vague (it often felt like there were several right answers... or none -- to me, this is sloppy quiz writing).
I honestly expected better from both Coursera and Duke!
This is especially important if the course has not actually started.
if u want a course about neuroscience there's way better course than this.
If I could give it less than 1 star, I would.
A very weak course, gives very little knowledge of grammar, doesn't really explain quite a lot of things.
Poorly executed.
Use more media to show your main ideas, take a class of public speaking and stop shaking a remote all the time you dont even use it.
Please, let us take the tests without money payment.
Sincerely,Garik
Lectures are very boring and designed in a weird way.
What's unfortunate is that you have to finish ever assignment, including this impossible assignment (for beginners) to get recognition for the course.
For me it was boring and too specific.
However, I have very little good to say about this course offering.
poorly planned, irrelevant to the subject test questions.
Endless flunking mal-grading system, is this Coursera's education method?
uses the phrase "you know" and "um" too much
The lecture just reads books.
If you can download a file and take a screenshot then you've got what it takes to pass this class.
The optional assignments are far too focused around a new piece of video sharing technology that the instructor and associates have developed.
Instead he often seems to ramble pointing out a 100 little questions that a world designer might ask himself/herself during the process without ever focusing on any.
It is more of a show-off of the university than it is an actual informative course.
The quantity and quality of the content - both video's and reading materials - is significantly lower than that of the other courses, where I really had to take notes and read much more.
I hope it doesn't adversely affected my grades as I have scored above 96% in the previous 3 courses in this specialisation.
Didn't learn anything.
Monotonous lecture style with frequent inaccuracies in delivery (says one thing but actually means another).
The software and the provided files are not fully working, something is always missing, constant error messages...
I found the instructor very hard to follow/understand (thank goodness for the written transcripts).
Much trivial content, but advertised as an expert course.
Should be integrated to other courses.
An absolutely dreadful course.
Mine sat unanswered for 5 days as the deadline passed.
Total disappointment.
Video after video of lengthy lecture with little variation.
This course is not suitable for beginners at all, everything basic is skipped.
I also was very disappointed in the teaching.
The worst course I've ever take in Coursera.
$79, and 1 month of work and it's all Javascript, no java.
I'm not sure why it's even offered on Coursera, other than to make money on a more popular website using the content hosted by less popular one.
He doesn't work through code but talks around the concepts.
Thus the least interesting and also the longest - makes little sense!As I said, I'm sorry to give this rating, but it needs to be said.
elementary linear algebra and probability), do yourself a favour and take Geoff Hinton's Neural Networks course instead, which is far more interesting and doesn't shy away from serious explanations of the mathematics of the underlying models.
I wouldn't never recommend this course.
Taking into account that the course in a list of measures for a successful weight loss, it's justified to provide the strategies sooner in order to help those willing to start losing weight start doing that.
You can't do the assignments unless you pay the subscription.
I'm struggling to even get through the first week of videos.
What is considered contribution?
The questions in the quiz are not "though provoking".
The course also took much more time to complete than I wanted to spend.
Took my payment but insists on another payment before it will let me submit an assignment.
Content is too basic, seems unresearched.
Did not finish the course, so it may have improved after the first few sessions.
Also, the assignment portion of the course asks you to submit a word or pdf with images, but it wasn't configured to allow uploads.
Псевдоученый с псевдостепенями и тантрист.
I took others' advice, and I also strongly suggest looking to other sources to learn Statistical Inference before taking this course.
Well, it's project-based alright, but where's the real guidance?
Not a fan of this course.
Content is appropriate but does not prepare you for even the final assignment or real genomic problems.
From my perspective, with his knowledge in this field as being described on his personal web site, he should be able to talk comfortably by looking at the topic on the slide then discuss about it in detail.
There are quite a few issues with the final assignment of the Getting and Cleaning Data course.
The teacher is boring
In fact, I started this so long ago that I don't remember most of what was said, only that it was long.
Repeats the same information over and over
On the forum, many students said they had to drop out during the last week (probably without getting a refund!)
Generic history information, nothing to teach really.
Perhaps this class would be good for a non - native english speaker.
Below the quality of the free classes taken in the past.
I would also suggest the instructor to interview more world-famous linguists, not just play simple ask and answer with his students.
The examples of different languages in the later weeks are interesting.
I just couldn't go beyond the first day
I just started the course and I'm going to stop this course right away.
The last course in the specialization allowed free access to graded quizzes and homework.
During this course, the "free access" to quizzes and assignments is no longer an option.
Even more annoying is the fact that I also receive email reminding me to "complete the quiz", which would require me to upgrade to a paid enrollment to allow me to submit assignments to grading.
Thanks for nothing, Coursera!
nobody wan's to waste tons of hours to learn nothing.
I figured that I was paying about $50 an hour for the lectures at regular speed.
The 90s classroom style video editing is annoying to boot.
There were many errata that really should have been fixed in the beta iterations of this course.
Thirdly, I really would like to see more application and less discussion of implementing algorithms.
Fourthly, the "scaling" section was also a major disappointment.
The lecturers are insightful and the courses have been at the right pace.
I shall explain my reasons below:1- The teaching method of this course is very lackadaisical and lackluster.2- The ratios are introduced and solved without having a P/L statement or a Balance Sheet on the side to see how the figures are extracted and implemented, which made it more boring.3- Its final 3-part quiz lacks the proper instructions and the redundant instructions already there do not help either.
I do not have a strong statistics background but I felt the first three classes in the certification challenged me, while providing an adequate level of support and thorough / articulate examples; the pace was perfect.
Extremely poor quality of instruction.
Course material was interesting but very rudimentary, the courses biggest challenge was understanding its spoken English.
I feel that I wasted my time and money on this course to be very honest.
The specialization started so well, but the care that was taken to craft the specialization course content in the beginning has been lost in the later courses.
waste of time.
The qiuz are managed terribly, full of error and I seriously doubt the professor ever seen these quiz before.
Instructor doesn't seem to be passionate about giving the lecture
Yes I agree with Honor and doing your own work but come on.
I don't recommend this class.
No music examples because copyrights did not allow, so the course is pretty boring.
Sorry, not for me.
While I enjoyed his examples & case studies, he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching.
Instead what is here is a course that not so subtly seems to have an agenda.
to explain pivot tables totals.
The whole course is nice and there were lot of new things to learn.
Beware - will make you upgrade to complete quizzes (and pay) - should definitely be much more upfront about this from the beginning.
Seems like very poor tactics on their behalf.
Not as advertized and way too much peer rating stuff--we do all the work the instructor does little or none--too much peer raqting stuff which I despise.
Only if we pay for them!
It is not suitable for people with no background in maths or physics
I think there needs to be a basic comprehension assessment done first, before allowing fellow learners the ability to pass/fail students in the course.
Coursera.
org says I have to pay for it again to continue which I am never willing to.
There is no interaction from the Wharton staff, nothing that connects this to anything learned in the specialization, and nothing that even resembles a case study.
Nothing but badly put together videos and recommendations for readings.
In the course info this is described as the first course in the series and that it requires no prior knowledge but the first week quiz contains questions referring to an equation 'discussed in the previous course'.
A lot of things to improve, specially thr learning courve is from 1 to 100 and a lot of pre knowledge need, your future public is the hobby robotics people who want to expand their knowledge, a litlle more weeks maybe two can increase the likes for the course.
The course dives in with more acronyms than the military, and assumes the attmpting learner already has a handle on APIs, SDKs, etc., not to mention many other technical terms (interfaces, ...).
Face tracking?
What are you talking about?
not very dynamic
Quality of the video and sound are bad; a few minutes after starting a lesson, sound goes off or picture holds and moves no more...
The quiz questions don't really test what was taught in the lectures, and the assignments are just copying and pasting things.
Some of the information even seems out of touch.
He doesn't state any information with certainty because he always tends to add "or not!"
As it is, Caffo's presentation needs some serious testing and remodeling, but there's no indication that it'll match what Khan Academy did regardless of how much work goes in.
This course is conducted mostly more or less by reading just the slides.
"I didn't read the Iliad or Odyssey some I'm not going to ask you to" in reference why in regression there are Greek letter used for coefficients (it's a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients), a 30 second exchange where a PC generate student says that they're "stocked" to run some regression followed by Proffessor Bushee informing us that "we're going to run some narly regressions", Professor Bushee saying he doesn't know how to perform Earning Management Analysis on Mars but he certainly knows how to do it on Earth, and a joke why people don't like accountants.
Sadly, enough all of these issues have caught up with me and I was unable to pass assignment 2 part 2.
The limitations of the assingments do not allow the students to practice what its been tought, but it is asked in the peer assingment from the students to evaluate it!.
This was more objective than I thought.
The lecture videos are poorly organized, concepts are not presented in the proper context and lack sufficient detail/depth, little thought or effort was put into designing the examples in the videos, there are no actual coding exercises until the last week, there are no examples of elegant code, nor thoughtful examples of good vs. bad code, the quizzes contain questions that are poorly worded and ambiguous (and I think some actually have the wrong answers and are contradicted by other online resources).
I find the topic dull and the content uninteresting.
This whole Specialization thing starts to make me feel like you guys are in urgent need of money, rather benefiting the community.
the course neither explains statistics properly, nor teaches how to use excel effectively, disappointed
I learned a few interesting things, but for the most part I'm extremely disappointed with this course.
Very disorganized.
I believe that this course should be called an Introduction to the basics of Nutrition and it's only for complete newbies.
She is reading in a monotonous way and nothing more.
Most of the information provided is common knowledge anymore.
I'm not a conversational learner.
Structured as a dialogue, you can show that a PM would ask, "You said that the game would make noise.
And further there are errors in quizzes.
Horrible class.
The stated module completion times are wildly optimistic.
It's such a pity.
I toughed out the course, but it only got worse.
These skills are not transferable anywhere else as I would have to pay to use them in future!
5x must be 5*x or it is not acceptable.
I am sorry, this is pretty bad
For someone with programming experience it is a drug, for someone new to programing (I am thinking my son) not very captivating.
For me, this course was disappointing.
A language does not have to be used by a single / unified group to define it as a language.
After taking solid courses like ModPo and Positive Psychology, I was amazed at the lack of effort that was put into this.
Unclear assignments, lectures are brief and sometimes unclear.
I would not recommend this course for beginners in programming.
Instead the course examples and assignments are based on a machine learning package called Graphlab, that stopped working when it was upgraded to version 2 (there are workarounds that enable it to work locally, but clearly it isn't "enterprise ready")
The assignments were overly complicated and demanding for no real reason.
The materials she selected are sometimes and only somehow relevant.
I can't get peer reviews so my assignments get zero feedback.
Presentation was awkward and slow, and at times condescending in tone.
Foundational tasks (i.
e.
Many students in the forums voiced their frustration.
The topic is interesting and the lectures itself were good.
Really?
Where is the first edition of this course with original lectures of Tom Mierzwa?
Any submission I did after that was not graded at all.
The assignments are not very clear.
I've heard later classes in the series are way tougher, so the ramp up isn't at all good.
It's almost exclusively about customer analytics.
I was eager to learn screenwriting as an interesting hands-on course.
Trust me, anyone could figure which hot keys to use.
Don't waste your time on this course.
Very strange concept of non-monetary benefits.
After all the things said, at the end the first video was about pancakes (nvm they were gluten free)
This is a course almost without any content.
If you are a native English speaker who doesn't mind spending an entire year and the cost for well-done videos on the subject is not important, then this course if for you.
I realized I wasn't the only person with the issue when I graded assignments from others who had trouble submitting their assignment.
The course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive.
They talked about hosting but didn't explain how to do it.
He seems all over the place and doesn't seem to follow a path that I can understand.
Very disappointed.
Some reviewers don't see beyond the format.
The system has glitches.
For those quizzes I took, I ended up doing them by trial and error.
I'm fairly baffled by the fact that there was no thought put into which examples might best illustrate the features they were trying to teach.
Really no substance to it.
I am highly disappointed with the policy of providing the homework only to the paid participants.
Did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but had it on the first quiz
The course (and specialization) really tarnishes - instead of enhancing - this institution's outside image and reputation.
Really a deception; sorry I took this class and specialization, a complete waste of my time and money.
This is not a great UX..
The preceding courses were interesting and helpful.
The feeling of each lesson being so scripted takes away from the feeling of a professor teaching material with which he is comfortable.
I forced myself to go through them until week 4, I finally give it up.
First, there was relatively little content; there was less than an hour of lectures each week and no actual programming involved.
Reduce the number of videos in each module to a max of say 6.
c.
Today we know more advanced and useful methodologies for entrepreneurship.
This course states that it is for people with no knowledge in SAS.
I read discussions, write post..
Overall, I would not recommend this course if you don't need the certificate.
It seems more like a 'talk', not a 'course'.
The course lacks detail and deepth and could be taught in 45 to 60 minutes instead of 7 weeks.
I think the homework problem are good, but they are very time consuming.
Putting some numbers on the slide without any explanation of how it works.
A total waste of time -- not challenging at all in any aspect.
The quality of the visual material is also variable, I am sure that including animation of more appealing graphics would be helpful to engage more people into the course; another challenge would be to prepare more challenging content.
However, the course merely was driven by complete hypotheticals that only required one to be educated about general business functions.
Only catered to the American healthcare system.
Would be nice as a free remedial class in prep for the main specialization.
Dear Professors/Instructors/TAs/moderators/coders:It is very good for you to start your work in a very early time!
Their English is quite unsuitable for video lectures!
This class was extremely disappointing.
Not really well produced for the media.
I only managed to complete the course by substantial independent research.
The content is essentially a subset of the information available in the free tutorials on Tableau's website.
It is most definitely not for beginners.
I had very high hopes for this course.
There needs to be more help available, at least for paying students, to answer questions and clear misunderstanding.
So if you pay money for it, start the course and do it till week 4, than pause and do the assignment and restart at a later date in order to comply to the necessary tasks.
With this course they seem to have streched it to a new extreme.
content is not good, too scattered content, cannot find focus.
assignments are meaningless.
I have completed two other Coursera courses for certificates, where I learned much more.
The Worst Course EVER on Coursera:It is important to realize at the outset that I am a very avid learner and always give everything a chance to be completely tried out before giving a judgement, and unfortunately, this course is by far, the only bad course I've encountered on Coursera for the following reasons:1- The professor wastes a whole week's module on explaining something trivial like the interest rate and compound interest rate without naming the necessary terminology that is commonly used.2- To make things worse, he has a condescending perspective on students and wastes so much time glorifying himself in an upsetting manner that patronizes learners.3- His demeanour is unprofessional and quite disturbing when he gives mentions at the end of the week that 'I can feel you.
the teacher is charismatic but the content is just theories and abstract ideas.....
just blah blah blah
I am sorry.
The distributions were not well explained, it could have been handled in a much better way!
This is part 2 in the robotics specialization.
Linking programming language to hardware sucks.
somehow it seems they just took an on-site course, played with some fancy technical solutions and call it now a MOOC... they seem not really aware of the fact that on-site teaching and MOOCs require completely different types of pedagogic methodsamazing how the same university can offer both the best MOOC (Dr. Chuck's) and one of the worst (this one)
In my opinion, this course is for somebody who never programming, it is not depend in which language.
13 weeks long?
If not for the forum, I would not have been able to complete th
Read a book instead.
Do not waste time on this course.
They rarely looked at us, they read flatly from the prompter.
However, the capstone project was a waste of time.
The lectures and quizzes are a joke.
Nothing interesting.
No, feedback from instructors, directly, makes it hard to obtain conceptual understandings.
Not for beginners as promised.
Had to quit the course because of that.
What kind of a business model is this.
I can't be the judge (since I hold a degree in this area), but I don't think you'll be able to get much if you aren't familiar with the topics yet.
I like to learn through examples but what they provide just makes it more confusing and hard to follow.
The teacher just read the PowerPoint,and his voice makes my sleepy.
Interesting topic, however I quitted.
Uninspiring teacher, repetitive material that could have been consolidated with month 2 altogether.
Did most of my learning from the supplemental readings.
That's the reason for me to drop out in between the course.
However, at least to me, the instructor seemed to extrapolate "some beliefs" to "all beliefs".
Yes, you can use other software, *except for the capstone*, per another reviewer: this is fatal.
Presenters just not fully prepared to lecture on the topic: the nail in the coffin was the end of the week 4 lectures on clustering: "So, at this point, you really should be able to go out there and build a really cool retrieval system for doing news article retrieval.
There are no assignments to submit, only online group works, which is not organised well at all.
I'm not here for monotonous lectures.
They assignment questions are often hard to understand.
Having taken first "Business Metrics for Data Driven Companies" I had high hopes that it would be on the same level.
Well, I was wrong.
I learned more about the basics in neuroscience in a 20 minutes lecture from a separate course, "Computational Neuroscience" than the entire first week here.
If you actually want to learn neuroscience, check out HardvardX's intro course.
Three reviews are requited for a grade, but she has so few reviewers that one might only get one review and then fail.
That is why I decided to discontinue the course.
Completely not what I've expected, too theoretical without examples and explanations..
Which is a shame since the individual lectures were well done and very interesting.
Wrong answers in quiz (eg week 3 quiz on progressivity), videos getting blocked at review question point, etc.
Why even have the game make noise in the first place?
Nothing is making sense.
The course is out of touch with reality and systematically underplays the Paris Agreement, progress of renewable energy and EU emissions mitigation, says absolutely nothing about climate science.
The certification, should be, I can really use and means something.
That's pretty far from what I expected from this when I paid $284 for the specialization.
In total, there is only 25minutes of video lectures.
Only fit for absolute morons and perfect ignorants.
So I quit the course.
There is a huge disconnect between the lectures and what is asked in the homework assignments.
I really hope it's better than the first one.
I came here to learn about Excel.
Homework assignments were confusing and did not appear to have been reviewed by the instructors before being sent to students (main problem, the free software students use was not the same version as that being used to develop the homework).
I estimate that there are 50-100 still pending review, many were submitted almost one year ago.
Not realistic at all.
I would also point out that the course is excellent for journalists but completely useless for those of us in the business world.
Sadly, there only english subtitles in the first video, so I can´t continue the course
It was really boring, hard to keep watching the videos and doing the activities.
Instead you are forced to write exactly what they expect.
Almost asked for a refund but decided to try to continue.
Or more precisely: they cover a few JavaScript libraries.
To sum it up, the course could really use a revision.
I didn't get past the second section.
Hopeless !
Unfortunately, I feel this series of courses are more of an advertisement for the instructor's software company.
If you are doing the course out of curiosity, for fun, or to learn how to control Unity, I'd give it a miss.
Beside getting a feel of what Ruby syntax is like, there was no learning.
It has almost no content and isn't actually useful.
The course uses a clunky presentation software.
I shouldn't need to do that.
The assignments had nothing to do with the lectures.
( i still really really appreciate the efforts of those who put it together with their hard work)
poor quality and even worse presentation by the teacher
Coursera and the University should seriously consider re-doing this particular course.
For someone who have no prior programming experience, these are definitely not suitable topics to start with.
I would not recommend it to anyone as it stands, regardless of the student's background, this course is just poor and lacking.
The premise of this course is a promising one, the topic is still in its infancy and seems very interesting.
sucks all the fun out of math, avoid this course, find an alternative where you can learn more with less time spent watching him write out 20 numbers.
This Course is not really free.
It barely compiles, the example notebook has method calls that use non existing methods of the SFrame object.
The course claims that it teaches the student how useful practical knowledge but then ends up using a non standard library and saying not to use pandas or scikit learn.
If you except to learn about functions, pivot tabels, macros and the many other exciting features of excel, this is NOT the course for you.
The first video was a ridiculous waste of my time.
Why not offer an option to test out of basic introduction courses?
The information was sometimes too basic and other time on much in depth.
Should have requested a refund when I could.
Some assignment files are not Mac friendly or is just not viewable by all students (I can't tell).
Thank goodness!
Always the same example: Malmo, Copenhagen... What about the rest of the world ?5.
Video lectures are terrible.
If you have higher education, and studied derivatives and matrices, this course is a quick review and test of your skills.
Sorry to say that this is not a well prepared course.
If I had paid for this course I would be incensed.
For instance, the usability issues covered in the studies are for ancient versions of browsers with no discussion of how the browsers and our infosec vulnerabilities have changed since those studies were published.
(further to the course timeframe) The assistance from developers was too poor and never sought to find solutions, which is very strange in a course for coaching.
I took the other courses from Brian Caffo and truly enjoyed them.
The "Pink Flamingo" peer-peer-reveiwed exercise needs to go.
Stay away from this one.
It is just what I experienced from this course that I am saying.
If no one is going to pay attention to it, it should be taken down.
At least it did not for me, leaving me wondering as to what next steps could be if I wanted to explore further.
Others, he goes quickly through a slide without any time to digest the information.
Looked at the ceiling Buddha 97% of his screen time.
The reading was too disjointed and the book on Mindfulness is really more commercial and repetitious that one would expect of a course in Coursera.
Also, some results were given without justifying them, for instance the concept of simplest number was stated but not proper
*No Stars*Another boring animal class that I would not recommend.
It also stresses review while learning.
I can feel each one of you now' to the degree that even the camera-person filming him cuts his nonsense out.4- After putting up with all his boring nonsense that I already know, despite being a linguist not a finance person, I gave him a chance and started doing his first 10-question Quiz, which was completely isolated from reality and unrelated to his course material or teaching.5- All questions were boring and calculation-intensive, and I still gave him and a chance and went through the whole boring set of 10 questions just to tell me that it needs upgrading for such a banal and facile course.
Now, I have an idea about the level of Teaching at Michigan University and I will recommend all my friends not to attend such a university due to the previously-mentioned reasons.
A complete waste of space.
Narrative about changing colors is reminiscent of Sal Khan.
It's fair to say we were all free-styling (i.
e.
The videos for this course seemed to be 30% recap of the prior lesson, and 20% restatement of what was learned.
I felt left alone and forced to google.
While this was one of the better courses I've done on Coursera, the start date of the course was changed without any indication of when it would begin.
Superficial and not well presented.
The final project came out of no where.
But I believe that it could improve it's quality, develop better slides, the teacher could be more dynamic.
Other features like innovative assignments based on real life, partnerships with companies to provide content, and everything that could be a differential to the course will be awesome.
In my view this defies the goal of Coursera to provide accessible education anywhere in the world!
I didn't learn much beyond what I already knew before I started.
This course's beginner friendly lectures do not align with the level of understanding needed to complete the assignments.
I suspect the sole purpose of its inclusion in the specialization is to fund Coursera.
So, good work, but unless the course is supposed to attract only ignorants and people that haven't been in contact with 'science', some of the instructors act a bit 'I know it all' and that is how it is, although no-one does yet.
an interesting subject is made quite dull.
i cannot spend $4000 per year package just to learn this course.
statistical analysis on a data set aggregated from disparate sources), and the pretty videos are at times completely unrelated to the actual assignments (the very first week with the literature review).
As with all the other sections in this specialization, there is no feedback for professor or TAs, which is very-very frustrating.
Major issues with the tests not accepting Chinese or pinyin text which they failed to respond to, despite multiple complaints.
Otherwise you will be faced with the painfully frustrating task of learning a package while trying to complete an assignment, all with a short deadline.
There are no native speakers, either - which does not rob it of the fact that there are winners of the Nobel Prize for literature who write in it.
I didn't sign up for a data class...
Actually, I am quite disappointed by this course.
For people who don't know programming at all only.
There was some stuff that could be interesting but you can find it somewhere else.
The lecturer is always reading and it makes me sick (sorry!).
Product Manager is not a MANAGER but a facilitator.
If I were to summarize this course (perhaps a little uncharitably, because I'm annoyed at the time I wasted) it would be: some dudes with a computer talk about some cool features of a programming language.
I didn't think it was possible to dislike finance more after taking a course designed for non-financial professionals.
Content of the course is great!
Course was the worst I have taken on Coursera.
Reasons:1) The subject material is presented in a dry manner (too much talking and jargon) - I find it repetitive and boring.
The instruction is not enough to solve the programming assignment.
Not at all what I expeted
Octave codes.
So, if you really want to learn ML and try it in practice this course is not for you.
Pretty much expected it would be the case, but just wanted to give it a try.
no one would take this course any more.
Because of the difficulty and technicality of the course, passing grade should be 7 out of 9, instead of 8 out of 9.
I thought it at all lectures.
It is tottaly unacceptable to have to pay to pass quizz !!
But know I think that I have just wasted my time.
The lectures IN NO WAY prepare you for the final assignment which is supposed to take two hours.
Extremely badly organized, messy, and technical
Very basic and superficial course.
I thought you would learn how to actually create a website, not just how to pick and install a premade wordpress theme.
I coded and validated, yet it returned error to me.
Avoid this course like the plague.
Peer Reviewed Assignment not a well planned marking system.
Now I can't
Would not recommend the course because of it.
The course is very bad and feels thrown together at the last minute.
If you really want to teach that's simple.
If you are planning to learn R, then go and buy a book.
The TA is excellent, without his help I wouldn't pass this course.
Really disappointing.
Not for new programmers.
Way too complicated for beginners.
English subtitles are in Hebrew also.
courses out there to learn basic inferential statistics.
One separate course for this topic is a waste of money.
Each week of this course should have been broken down into individual 4 week courses.
VERY poor development here and I would not recommend it to anyone.
You could only submit text in a text box.
This class presents very elementary information in the video lectures, then it requires knowledge far beyond what is taught in the course to finish the final project.
There are subtitles but it's not possible for everyone to put that much effort.
However, the introduction is lack of logic, and I still find myself lacking of systematic command of the material towards the end of this session.
Creates an exaggerated and arbitrary distinction between prescribed drugs as all good and recreational as all bad, and dismisses any possible benefits of substances that are not legal, noting only that medical marijuana has been helpful for HIV patients, which is certainly an understatement.
I would not recommend this course.
First The presentation of the following weeks is done by handwriting on software that give a very very poor graphic view.
too hard in practice
Your bad!Best regardsKonstantin
Would not expect anything else from the neo-liberal flagman, Yale.
Unfortunately, the material and lectures of this course fell short of my expectations.
Please avoid to take this course!
It also does not explain these theoretical concepts in detail enough.
Further evidence of abandonment.
And the worst thing is one of the last tasks contain a bug which doesn't allow you to pass this course.
The professor does a nice job of layering the complexity from basic concepts to more advanced concepts.
While this course presents great content and valuable information, the caveat is in the overall experience.
Online classes work best when interesting material is married to dynamic speakers.
Luckily, I did figure out how to turn off the almost twice daily notifications.
Overall I was disappointed with this course.
In previous session the staff just refered you to the coursera helpdesk, but you cannot easily contact coursera directly.
Main focus of course seems to be earning money and not educating.
I think for somebody who has no prior knowledge in this course will find it difficult to understand.
The course could be completed in a matter of a few hours.
Kinda feels like a waste of my time.
The whole effort seems totally half-baked, and nowhere more so than in this course.
I might not be so harsh if there weren't such great examples of well designed pedagogy elsewhere in Coursera, and for material that's at least as dry as statistics.
Extremely boring and not
For such a terrible course to then change payment terms without my authorisation.
I really regret my decision to join this specialization and the waist of money.
I feel it very complicate and not friendly for a person with 0% guitar skills.
You also run the risk of getting a lesser grade than you deserve because your reviewer is incompetent, which is a bummer... At the moment the course has very few people taking it (the same people I peer reviewed, also reviewed me, which leads to me to believe that maybe only 3 or 4 people were taking this course during the November 2016 iteration).
Course has not been updated.
I do not recommend this course if you want to be taught intuitively.
When reviewing other classmates material it was quite clear that people were confused with the assignments because I saw such a huge range of submissions that were very different from each other.
I found the material to be very similar to the first course in this specialization; both asked very similar things but this class didn't add much to the process.
Nothing works.
Much better intro to Swift can be found on many youtube channels or just on swift documentation website.
I appreciated having my attention drawn to the pitfalls of HCI design and the consequent failure of the corresponding systems.
I was hoping to complete the specialization for this, but it doesn't seem like this course provided me with enough to proceed.
Unorganized and not very useful.
I can't see any English subtitles added to this course.
I think it would help to take this part out of the specialisation.
This is a mathematics course and your paying customers are not going to use the knowledge from this course in their jobs.
There is not enough material.
I wanted to take a course in something that would at least get me some kind of job or volunteer work within my field of interest.
Life is too short.
Very unclear in the way it was presented and the subject that are being talked about and not very interesting, partly because it was to easy for me.
", and could not locate the answer.
This deserves a report, if there was adequate reporting system on Coursera.
In general I would say it still has so much space for improvement.
Instructor hasn't put any thoughts in how they should strucutre this course.
Cover no basics, assumes lots of thing and term this course as beginner for Java where actually there is no Java taught.
An idea is explained in 3 minutes when 30s are enough.
The automatic grader provides no feedback at all except pass or fail.
It's a badly designed assignment that wastes students' time and creates a lot of frustration.
After couple lecture, my mind was very clear.
But most of the time I'm working on the statistics software name R. I think it would be better if require R knowledge.
The peer reviewed assignments in this course are discriminatory towards people with learning disabilities.
I had really high hopes for this course.
No instructor assistance is given.
The material are not well structured.
The assignment is very unrealistic and the graders don't give any feedback!!
I was charged money for using it.
I was really disappointed with this course.
None of the spreadsheets or workbooks illustrated in the videos are available anywhere on the course site, despite their being advertised in the videos.
There is nothing under any of the weeks lectures.
Sadly, this course is at the high school level at the most.
However, an overkill as a separate course (and hence charging $30 for it).
If you feel all the material in this course has to be studied, then to achieve the objectives in (a) and (b) above, divide this course into two parts, Astronomy: Exploring Time and Space - part I & II.
e.
Should state up front that there is no auditing.
You need to pay to participate in the quizzes.
And I don't really understand what coursera is doing by the way?
Very poor course, especially when it gets to the last weeks, there are no enough instructions to help you in the exam.
This course is about nothing, it is poor illustrated and uninformative.
If you don't have a special purpose for the certificate - don't pay a cent for this.
The writing assignment instruction reads,for example, "Identify headers, alt-text, and etc.
Very simple, very slow.
Unfortunately as the course progress the course material and videos become less and less helpful.
To make things worse, the lecturer (who doesn't appear in the videos) speaks incredibly fast, while graphs and bullet point lists fly by on the screen.
Due to that I'm un-enrolling from this course.
You have me lost.
This caused that videos were too long considering the amount of knowledge that was provided to students and watching them was waste of time.
The course was shallow, information did not go deep.
It's very high level, and they hand-wave important concepts.
This course wasn't good.
Listening to these teachers explain each subject poorly was killing me.
There need to be a little more explanation beyond the slides.
The assignments and weekly work is by far much more than the hours estimated.
The accents of the instructors make it difficult to understand the material
Not good for my heart!Sorry if it is a mean (not statistic mean!)
Get one part wrong and you miss the whole 1 point.
For one, I am not paying for it, many will follow...
This review does not reflect the course content.
Further a better use of time would be to start doing the capstone on day 1 and do all of the lectures and quizzes later as the quizzes were very easy and anecdotal, but the capstone required more time then scheduled in the course.
If he had a BritiI really struggled to listen to him as his accent crosses the Atlantic several times a sentence.
They just sell the certificates.
A good instructor and interesting assignments, but the information presented was quite shallow.
The structure of the lectures is not really effective.
One long advertisement for the instructor's book.
There are better (Free!)
You spend most of your time Googling to learn it, and I find that I would have learned R better if I just did that to start without this course.
Too much art therapy.
Later assignments are more involved, but there are still only 4 of them.
It is really infographics for journalists WITH experience in Adobe Illustrator.
I found it hard to become interested in the course or Kierkegaard after having high hopes of truly enjoying it.
very boring and uninteresting delivery..
It is a poor propaganda for religious.
The instructors should also give their contacts to let their students contact them when the discussion forums dont work
The course gives some ideas about time management.
The instructors dissapeared and nobody knew if this one was going finally to happen or what.
It shouldn't be too difficult to provide one page that gives the commands to execute to create the DB that is used in each week (for each week separately).
But courses with that kind of quality but staggering price will destroy the company's brand.
With some changes that course will fly high :)
It's just observing course, theoretical 95%.
I felt the course went far too fast and is definitely NOT a course for beginners.
The "professor" spews the material like reading poetry.
in the beginning of the course i thought i'll get a good experience as usual on coursera, but i was wrong ...
a lot of things >> to be introduced in next courseconfusing data types & working with things i don't know about it.
you've said that, anyone with basics of programming could pass this course and after 6 months i couldn't.
please be sure about the prerequisites next time.
This is particularly evident in the final week, an incoherent ramble.
They are just passively reading the content from somewhere so it is hard to concentrate because the interactivity value is zero and their accent takes some time to get used to.
Both content and delivery of this course were disappointing even though I was (and am) really, really interested in this topic.
the quality of this course is very low, and the content are not interesting and useful at all.
After all of these videos, you will ask yourself, "okay, why did Severance make me watch that?"
This course is actual for Mac machine, all instruction are for Mac only.
The topics are also cover in this field.
Also the course for week 3 has information related to finance which is beyond understanding levels of a person with no financial background.
Your program runs through maybe 100 tests to ensure correctness but somehow the instructors decide you should only see the first 3.
This needs to be taught with more frequent hands on examples.
Very poor.
It is actually a course on Managing Agile Software development, not Product management.
There is common understanding in active product management community that major focus for product manager is market.
I personally feel cheated out of my 29 USD.0.1 star.
I think the teacher had to little expression , it was like he was reading loud, and I felt I might have red the text myself.
Poor content, only a book accompanies the videos and we should not be forced to buy anything!
It is just like reading a book, a very boring one.
that is very unecessary.
After months of this course repeatedly being delayed we see a complete failure with 'Information Design', both in course and in practice.
I was very dissapointed with this course and the time-wasting assignments.
The course is very light on substance.
Not enough support!I
so easy
They also had lectures which were designed to help learners attempt the quiz and special section about MATLAB and how to build robots.
Not the purpose of thes courses.
U of Minn should be ashamed of this course, and provide some training on how to run a distance learning course to its instructors.
It was too basic and slow paced.
They just see what encourages their view and their opinion and ignore everything that contradicts their course, opinion, believe and dogma.
This is unfortunate as it can look like your code is working correctly but, the grader is using some edge cases to grade the code but will not include any information indicating what to look for.
Submit button wasn't working for assignment, assignment was heavily weighted on mobile app (which was the least pertinent part of the course for me), generally seemed disorganized.
The presentations are filled with strange icons and drawings appearing every here and there, making not much of a professional impression.
After watching videos, in just about 5 minutes after the lecture is over, the retained information was always going to zero.
BUT as it turned out they don't have any clue what this second law of thermodynamics means.
Course material is very poor and did not give much support for doing assignments.
There is no degree of freedom in programming.
The class is a lot more advanced than the class description makes it seem.
In fact, the video lectures spend the majority of the time explaining these concepts, while spending very little time explaining how to use Python to access web data.
it so boring
It wasn't even clear at times of what was exactly being expected in the assignment.
I can't make heads or tails of what the discussions were referring to, when they are all clumped together at the course web site instead.
A new generation of MOOC with REL available for free on the web as teaching ressources!Already got that elsewhere...
What is the point of writing frequency.
pl where there is a hist() function in R?
I got so many failures, which I had to look for by myself.
What a shame.
I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything.
I was stuck in a particular problem because auto grader did not give me a clear feedback as to why I was incorrect.
It is super boring and gives me little information.
I had a great difficult in understanding it....
I quitted before ending.
He showed himself completely inept to have a debate with more than one course participant and chose to censor a variety of viewpoints he dislikes.
Even I have purchase it and finished week 1-3, I still chose to drop out.
What I learnt for future courses: I will look into the detail of every assingment before starting and paying.
Fell behind and there isn't really anyone there to help.
could u plz help me
It lacks depth.
I was focused and engaged in studying for each quiz, however, after 3 failed attempts I had an imposed break period that makes little sense.
Too much instruction of the teacher, few practice instead.
They push the University of Maryland way too much, the book and the videos have much of the same content.
Forcing users to install demo software which requires a registration is just too lame.
Other than that, courser is very boring, introductory, jumps constantly between things and doesn't explain much.
While those things may be easy to explain without the math they are very difficult concepts to implement and a simple 10 minute video won't clear the fog.
You absolutely will not 'master' data analysis with this course.
absolutely one of the worst courses...
If I can understand all of these derivatives, why shall I attend your course?
If you do not know R studio or R programming this course will be very difficult for you.
To lock assignments for money is disgusting.
This course has nothing to do with "emerging technologies."
90% of the answers to the multiple-choice questions were the top option!!
Many of the examples provided have been proven to be farces and/or practical jokes.
Not experienced with GitHub?
I wish the course had at least acknowledged that there are cases where a slight compromise on usability might be necessary for the sake of appropriate security.
Lastly, for those designing an HCI for security, it is important to understand threat models.
It is also obsessed with command line interfaces.
It very common to forgo cash remuneration for non-monetary benefits (mainly for tax advantages) which was largely ignored in this course.
At times the attitude is down right hostile and disgusting.
We want to learn SEO not how someone got started on seo!
If there is -5 stars option, I'll put this score in front of the lecturer and tell her WHAT A BAD COURSE her give us.
If you've never written a script before you're not going to get a lot of help here other than researching things yourself, which you can do without this course.
The only handicap to me is the accent of the speaking English.
I gave up after the 2nd week and I now feel more than ever overwhelmed by setting my own website.
Much more in-depth information is necessary, including step by step screenshots of various processes.
Terrible course.
The material is very poorly explained.
By the 3rd week, I stopped caring about this class, and my grade for that week definitely expresses my disinterest.
I do not like the Course.
The grading system I dont like it.
Poorly designed videos, too long and confused
Very annoying.
my $279 are stuck in here and they don't reply to forum posts.
of Any information given to the student is from magazine/newspaper/journal articles without data and we are tasked with identifying a business solution to a problem with little context.
I recommend having a significant knowledge of statistics before taking this course.
The use of the hand-written pros and cons was an unnecessary novelty.
They're really nothing more than that.
Bloody coursei am very much angry with this course
I went in this course with high expectations.
I am very, very glad I decided to check out the course for free before paying for the specialization.
The course has a lot of required software.
I really can’t figure why the instructor doesn’t provide an outline of what key concepts he wants us to learn from each lecture.
too mechanistic.
Too much mathematically without well illustrated examples.
I would learn much better with just reading a book.
In other videos, the opposite: loud lector and quiet DAW.
You must use trial and error to find the wrong answers the quiz is looking for.
But certainly not for learning some basic Excel and MYSQL.
Very low content: I got more information about Berklee than about music from this course.
Only for those who are new to everything involving computers.
The exams were so easy that I could pass them at 100% without watching most of the videos.
I dropped this the first time when I kept introducing things that completely had not been introduced, took another stats class, then came back and aced it.
I understand paying for a certificate, but I don't want the certificate.
No use for me.
The instructor says time & time again that she's not going to bother to explain in detail and that we should go out & explore all these free resources if we want to learn.
That is not creative nor helpful at problem solving.
Do not take this course unless you have previous C# coding experience.
But you never knew.
Got to a part where a command on my terminal wouldn't work and given I have no idea how it works to begin with I couldn't debug the issue.
Also as a general review of the little of the course I did it's generally considered poor form to just read back what the viewer can see on the screen already when doing presentations.
It felt like a plain reading of mathematical expressions and descriptions.
Even, though everything looks like it works and achieves the desired goal and even works with all of my own test cases.
I think the way it is taught is not very insightful, the lecturers clearly just read a script and make it difficult to follow.
I had to resort to many different sources just to be able to get by the course.
It also seemed she had trouble pronouncing many of the words and I do not want to learn how to pronounce many of them incorrectly also many of the slides did not have an English translation on them.
Rather, I would strongly encourage anyone seriously interested Giving to check out Peter Singer's course, "Effective Altruism".
This course doesn't worth the price.
Also, the title of this course barely matches the expectation one has about the content
The videos are too short, without enough information about the topics.
Why is this course dangerous?I took this course because first I liked the idea to have a history lesson spanning the age of the whole universe.
Being able to reiterate acronyms or idiosyncratic mnemonics does not demonstrate any real understanding of this field.
Any course that requires a webcam is not serious.
I have ADD and I cannot take excessive talking.
Although I have passion with film, the quizzes seems to have lots of technical problems.
In particular, in lessons 2 and 3 all "topic introductions" could be joined with the following "let's discuss this topic inside a DAW" video.
Awful dynamic range.
!This might be the last straw for me in this specialization.
This is way too esoteric.
They are just about remembering values.
I woudn't recommande this course since it is more like a book then it is like a course.
Frankly, buying a book would at least give more guidance than tossing one-minute 'lectures' out there and having students blindly fend for themselves under the guise of "experimental learning".
Plus, you then have an all or nothing grade system - there is no middle ground, just pass or fail on an assignment that had little to no instruction or examples listed to begin with.
I'm truly surprised that Coursera agreed to allow this course as it is.
This is MOOC, not a college course.
topic is interesting however the lecturers not quite lively
The statistics I can do with pen and paper; the programming, I found very, very unhelpful and confusing.
I use Windows so it unuseful for me.
Extremely disappointed.
Other classes teach this material infinitely better.
I have spent more time figuring out how the simulations are implemented that really learning about the target algorithm to implement.
Very boring presentation of the material.
Grades can be to vary.
The videos are read by the "teachers", so the inflections are wrong, making it very hard to follow.
It was obvious (or at least seemed as if) he was reading a teleprompter.
I abandoned the specialisation because of this, I know it's a big business but at least you need to offer some value for the money
In terms of content the course is superficial and weak, it's also too much focused on promote Cruyff event and institute.
If I could, I would rate it 0/5 stars.
Do not, I repeat, DO NOT pay and enroll this course.
Why should I waste my time listening to someone reading a book to me...
Awful teacher and explanation and material
Badly taught, strange choice of assignments and quiz questions.
the coarse needs a lot of improvement for the explaining way and the data offered way
Where is the quality assurance.
The instructor looks nerves when he talking.
Instructor gives minimal examples and says "go look on stack overflow".
Nothing much to learn, the videos were rather short.
I had high hopes when I was done with the first week, but now I have to say I'm bored and demotivated!!
even though for the most part I found the videos engaging, the course's overall structure doesn't help to 'read the novel together', as is stated in the title.
...
In all other courses the expectation of the exercises were sufficiently clear and straight forward that I never had to check the forums to solve them.
Also, the code style of the exercises is literally an anti-pattern in idiomatic Scala, against everything learnt in the previous Scala courses: "var" all over the place, low level loops like in C or Java, etc.
I plan to start again sometime in the future and see if I can figure things out in this course.. after I learn about Buddhism somewhere else first!
Shannon theorem...
what the hell emory?
Content of the course was good but any feelings of accomplishment were overshadowed by the frustration of trying to straighten out what turned out to be a problem with coursera.
There are other, higher-quality Data Science MOOCs available.
The entire "Capstone" was driven by hypotheticals, almost all of which did not have any relevance to the past four courses.
There is also a limited course support from the staff and no feedback in general for any of the issues raise.
It has the feel of some sort of odd "New Age" repackaging of things already obvious to anyone with even a modicum of leadership ability.
I've not found this course organized pedagogically speaking.
Really frustrating method of teaching.
I've started the course and i have found "learn to program" part, but where is "quality code"?
Or does the customer actually have to do creative work, in the case of Threadless.
The big problem with this course is that it does not introduce the student to any new mental frameworks, leave alone anything practical.
Extraordinarily dry presentation.
A paradox that a course about virtual instruction is the worst course I've done on Coursera.
Never again.
Bear in mind that Virtual Instruction is a fast developing field and the technology as well as the legal framework are changing very fast too.
In a nutshell, if this course were not a part of a Specialization track, I would not have paid for it.
Unless you want to do the specialization, I wouldn't recommend this course or any by the UC Irvine because all of the lack forums and no channels for communication with the instructors!!
You have to give textual answers without having enough help for memory calculation.
Was looking for some specific tactics to use, but even though the course syllabus refers to tactical information on influencing people, it lacked any specificity to make it useful.
I found it very hard to understand the lecturers and what they were saying.
Not worth 29$ considering you could take away very little from this course.
The capstone, just like the courses of the specialization are a strong illustration of the problems of higher ed.
It is not well done as the previous courses.
Basically impossible to complete quizzes and course project using the provided course material.
Naturally some of the grader fails were my own fault, but the majority of issues I ran in to could have been avoided by better worded assignments and/or more detail about requirements.
Lastly, it was taking sometimes days to get any response to requests for guidance on the forums / discussions.
No teaching.
UIUC has to revamp this.
Not a very good course layout
I dislike whole specialization.
Because videos are waste of time.
I took up to week 2 and, so far, this course assumes statistics knowledge.
I found the content and the presenters much less engaging than in "Developing Innovative Ideas for New Companies: The First Step in Entrepreneurship".
It's poor instructional design to only teach somethings and expect students to complete assignments without giving them all the tools they will use in the assignment.
bad coarse unclear one
If you just want the information, watch the videos but don't expect anything else, including any response whatsoever from this course.
I believe this can be useful for school graduates, but if you have at least a couple years of hands-on experience, you shouldn't find anything new.
I had a very poor experience being graded by peers.
The professors refrained to only mention a few cases of how companies dealt with certain matters rather than provide the tools used in order to reach those decisions.
Boring, most of them are history.
This should be changed.
Not very helpful, very stessfull music and only read definitions, do discussion or explanations to go deeper into the topic.
But there is no other courses offered for C++ programming language in English Language.
The person is just reading the slides, there is no learning action taking place
Most of us have only placed some static images and simple animations on top of the face shown in the camera view, and that is actually enough to get full marks according to the form used in the peer review.
It could be better designed
i cant seem to get anything correct because of computers
animations, animations and animations...
Sorry
Big part of the course videos devoted to history of how the technology was developed, not much technical information about the technology itself.
not paying) take the assessments.
Instructor takes too long to do too little.
This is a major failing in a paid course such as this.
Hated every week of this course and I wouldn't dare to continue with the full specialization program.
The tips offered by Al Warren in the Discussion forum make the assignments possible to do.
very poor organized.
I have no way to evaluate if I'm picking up the concepts or not, which is a struggle.
If she'd upped the game- showed basics and then talked about the benefits of adding, say, chia seeds, different fruits, flax, etc.
There is vagueness and ambiguity, which is almost impossible for the uninitiated to resolve.
the assignments were very hard to understand.
Amazon has changed its interfaces and I could not do the installation as recommended.
He is simply reading the book that he wrote and no real practice was ever done.
The assignment requires that we research on Stack Overflow and Pandas documentation.
The quizes were basic (largely based on recall of, rather than application of knowledge), as were the programming assignments (nearly all of which were spoon-fed, with the tasks sometimes being simple as multiplying two matrices together).
If you are serious about machine learning and comfortable with mathematics (e.
g.
Content is not well organized, videos are disconnected from one another, explanations are not clear, spreadsheets contain vast information that is not explained anywhere.
Not the mention video quality that is scary, I could not watch the videos, and preferred to study by reading the transcriptions.
Very poorly organised material and illustration
You won't regret it.
You have to be joking.
Take this course if you want to get depressed out of ever learning any programming.
The structure is this:-tons of info about stuff with unclear application-tons of info about stuff with unclear application-tons of info about stuff with unclear application-a gigantic task where you don't actually use half of the material from before, but instead need to use some material from the future module or from just googling things.
You never get to understand why what you wrote didn't work and why it should be the way your classmate wrote it.
The course makers don't seem to be interested in your feedback.
I expected a course to talk about elections and apply it to 2016.
The "swirl" exercises are woefully inadequate to prepare students for the quizzes.
I also reached out to chat support, they went through and said they couldn't find anything wrong and couldn't help me and a refund was impossible because it's past the refund date.
Course assignments should be reasonably given based only the materials covered in video.
I don't think I will bother with part 2
But the accepted answers are totally different from such a description.
It was too basic for me.
Not really enough content to be a course in it's own right, should be additional material as is useful, but definitely not a requirement.
Lectures don't follow a logical path and are all over the place, and some concepts are not expanded as required.
Perhaps it's just that I'm not a part of the target audience of this course, but I am deeply dissatisfied with it.
No longer a entirely FREE course.
All courses that require you to upgrade to submit quiz answers should be noted in the information about the course!
I have used Coursera for years and this is the first time I have wanted a refund.
Aside from a couple of rare interviews and old video records [which admittedly were very interesting, though too few], I found nothing of value that cannot be learned by reading Wikipedia or other easily accessible sources.
Presentation, "visuals", word choice, speed, all very poor.
Presenter is very bad lecturer.
Compared to that, this specialization is pretty bad.
Not worth doing this specialization.
Meaning that beginners will NOT pass this course.
Teaching bit arithmetic in a first programming course is NOT.
The rest of the material is ok but very basic.
I am working as a business analyst in a data warehouse consulting firm, so I was highly motivated to take all the courses!
Many errors are often encountered.
There was also so much about human development etc that I started to wonder when the info about dogs would start....
I found the formatting so different from other courses I've taken, that it was hard to get started and figure things out.
This is a course for students with little or no work experience.
This one contains quite a lot of errors.
This needs to change.
To my horror, the course only got worse from there.
This course was clearly thrown together with a minimum of effort by someone who is not qualified to teach the subject.
The professor was reading things from the screen 90% of the times (he looked bored himself).
I dropped after a week
Signing up for the 5-course specialization and paying in advance was a ripoff since the software requirements changed in between course 3 and 4.
This course mainly teaches how to download data with keywords, and how to plot graph, not worth the effort of learning.
To pass assignments off of 4 or 5 peer reviews is worthless.
That way going in a student would realize that there actually was a hidden agenda.
You really need to have a good grasp of Accounting otherwise you will get lost.
No forum + No email + No support whatsoever = Very frustrating
And as a student with a business background, I learned zero things related to PR or research.
The capstone project itself was disappointing, I learned much more from doing my own app in class #3.
I took the Coursera Android specialization, which was eons better than this.
The course video provided is quite short, the quiz is rather than nothing and the programming assignments are buggy.
The presenter are very annoying and i did not learn anything from this...
(After your assignment is submitted)Secondly, there was no documentation/help for the fact the Windows needs a webserver to run content in this section.
Very bad explanations.
Use videos to explain concepts, but stuff your videos with practice problems.
I dropped out of this course twice is coz i found it absolutely dead.
The tests make very little sense, use elements not described in the course and is generally very confusing.
I spent two days clicking back and forth and listening to a lot of talk that taught me nothing.
The title of this class should have read "Programming for Anybody that already knew a decent amount about basic Programming(Continuing with Python)"
There were no suggested readings in addition to the quite basic videos.
Otherwise you don't know enough to even go find the pieces you need.
Overall, I believe they need to improve how the content is presented, and how it's applied in a real world context.
Her presentations have no meaning.
Simply too simple.
This course has little or no information, not at all what was advertized, too much peer stuff
I watched like 10 videos and learned nothing about the course subject.
Waste of time, waste of money no one wants to spend lifetime to get a certificate especially when one knows what he or she is talking about.
But I have ti rate this as 1 star.
I did learn a couple of things, despite everything, but I would not recommend this course.
R is really just the worst, and the instructors do not make it better.
The market moves on news, rumors, scandal, etc; think Enron, Worldcom, Texaco, et al.
the "correct" choice is all that's needed for the system to be optimally functional; and 3.)
This week I decided the value isn't there.
After 2 great courses this one is really disappointing!
Then they throw you an assignment that requires you to do rather complicated coding (for a true beginner) without any other form of practice before hand.
The assignments are also a bit of a mess.
I'm sorry that I'm going to sound harsh, but this course is useless.
It touches so many different topics without going deeply into any of them.
Bad video quality and errors in course material.
I have only limited experience with the command prompt.
Cade Massey presents research he did with Dick Thaler!
Maybe suitable for those who is alredy a scientist and just need to get some general sence of data science.
They try to ear-train you, but any app for ear-training will do it better.
I appreciate that Marketing requires a broad interaction, but a course designed to take 4 weeks (with 2~3 weeks of actual content) is too much.
And I am not happy with this course.
The only reason I have to complete this course is because of the requirement in specialization degree.
Repetitive content, like the latter course, not challenging
I am trying to find out how to un enroll
He's confident, he's got presentation and cute animation, but his message is just as quack as his teachers!
not very good audio.
If you scroll through the week's discussion forums, many student posts go ignored.
You can't drop the course past the second (I guess) week so the system will keep on keeping on long after you've given up on trying to figure out the janky notebook thing.
Will not return to Coursera for any reason.
the lectures are worth listening to, and I did that with some interest, but as a course, the administrators have failed.
The written assignments are very simple and do not require any mental resources other than memory.
What a lazy excuse of a course.
Every time I click "go to course" I get directed to the description of the course.
This is a nice effort, and it obvious how hard everyone has worked.
The lecturers often refer to the videos which are not part of this course.
waste of time
A lazy reviewer gave me the score of 0 and left me this comment: "I am not able to give any score, I tried very hard to understand the matter but it was difficult for me.
They serve more as a review if you know the subject, otherwise I don't think most people will get much from them.
The audio isn't very good for most of the lectures, many having an very annoying chirping sound (from when you leave an old flip phone near a computer... "teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-tehhhhhh....".
the peer review was a waste of time, some individuals submit whatever other review whatever; I found that the assessment criteria is not based on evaluating the quality of performed work, and therefore have not really learned much from the capstone project.
Uses R with no explanation.
The price for the certificate for this superficial short mini course has reached the same price ($ 44) as what I payed for the extensive great Machine Learning course from Stanford University by Andrew Ng !
Questions about the class and submitting assignments went unanswered.
I did not get any feedback on my work.
At one point in the course the teacher says, if you don't know: Google, Yahoo,etc., but if you are going to have to google 99% of things, it's pointless taking this course.
Very low material not enough examples ( full emails)
Not interesting.
To many examples about russian emitents
The female lecture's speech is so fast and unclear, even though the subject itself is very interesting but I have to leave this class.
I don't recommend this course.
I dislike the examples he uses : violence, sex, illness, accidents, weapons, war, drugs - and fruits, ok. Are these the only topics of interest to him?
This is NOT a beginner's course.
Concepts are not well-explained, a lot of material for completing the tasks is missing.
A S/w product, on the other hand, is built and sold to a range of users in the target group, who can be individuals to large organizations.
Really don't recommend this cource at all.
Read the discussion forums and you'll see what I'm talking abut.
Professor speaks too slowly most of the time but then quickly glosses over complicated equations without much explanation of what the equation is or what the variables are or labeling the equations (he has multiple equations on one slide when talking).
Slow videos repeating several times the same thing (not a pedagogical / "good to fix an idea" kind of repetition), which makes them hard to follow.
However the worst are the exercises: the first time after 3-4 other Coursera Scala related courses where I have to actively check the forums for minute details about what is expected / implied for the solutions to pass the grading.
Things like what to do when updating the kmeans and you have duplicates, subtle differences between average and mean, etc.
What makes this course useful are the exercises so unless you are paying, don't bother, and it's not really worth paying for as it's just a synopsis of stuff you easily find on youtube.
It has nothing to do with widening network.
No real applicable knowledge gained
"Computational Investing Part II is coming shortly."
I feel cheated now.
Sometimes too simple and suddenly too technical.
The first segment on why "Digital Changes Everything" is good background but the rest was too abstract for me with nothing I could really take away and practice.
Super basic stuff.
I'm pleased not to have paid for it.
The lecture material is also not logically organized and does not correspond to the assignments.
they have to put a note that this course is just for Turkish students not for international .
Not very interesting or well-presented.
Not for the basic student looking for information.
I thought maybe course 4/4 would be better but nope, same problems here.
I loved learning.
This feels like it's just been dumped on the students without any real testing or any appropriate resources to sort out any problems.
Actual quiz question and correct answer: Which is NOT a good way to approach grocery shopping if healthy choices are desired?
In particular the last portion of the class wherein you are tested on things that were not taught.
The videos must change to include more details about the presented topic.
I am about to drop out of the specialization only because the specific course.
'Cape Verdi' and if you try to take any of this into account you do not get the same numbers to pass the test.
One glance at the discussion forum shows: they are fast in answering good feedback and compliments by students, but critical questions (with scientific papers who show different facts) get ignored for weeks and months.
I'm glad I took this course successfully.
Most of the time he was only giving what is their in the course Mooc 1 2 3etc etc.
very watered down
Its difficult to say that this course provides some practical knowledge.
For the rest it's not worth the money.
A poor end to a poor Coursera specializations.
hard to follow not because it is difficult, but the lecture is only slides, texts, reading slides, very boring and not so many hand-on instruction.
Such lame quizes, I cannot pass them although I know this material in my sleep,because the english is so bad and has so many ambiguities; There are no single answers to a question, instead you need the check the correct answers, which are phrased in s misleading way, and one little mistake fails the whole question.
Some material gets repeated throughout the course.
The instructor was terrible.
It would be better if the instructors cared to respond to queries.
It won't get better.
Did I need a Stanford University course to tell me that one?!?!
)What I can't get over is that this is part of an interaction design specialization that teaches design concepts, but whose instructors almost never practice those concepts in their pedagogy.
)The content is interesting though.
There are not videos.
You are not allowed to submit the quiz if you do not pay.
The instructors are not well prepared for the course.
Very poor explanations.
After having a two month delay, the course not only lacked any direction, but seemed to be put together last minute without any real thought or plan.
However, the biggest problem was instructorAlasdair Richmond, whose response to debate was locking threads down every time his ideological positions were challenged.
It's very sad to see students follow suit by producing hard to read codes, ignoring programming conventions.
As an analytic leader in healthcare industry (I am supervising some of my junior level team members to get some basic training), I want to say something to the students graduated from this course: if you program the same way as being taught, you will lose a competitive advantage during job interview.
water on the mill
Why a company failing in its industry was chosen as the focus is beyond me.
It appears that the instructors and TAs are simply reading the transcripts and bombarding equations on the screen.
often a required number of answers to pass a quiz is the same as the total number of questions in that same quiz.
Here's the thing... scoring "good" equals a fail in the project and, therefore, a fail in the course.
Lessons seems to be, at least, not prepared by the teachers.
The video lectures are not adequate, too much self-study effort is needed to have a good understanding of the subject.
Capstone exercises were very ambiguous, the students were left to interpret they way they had to finish and how they rated their peers.
The peer reviews were poor with little to no feedback and the focus was on how the material was laid out vs what the content was.
I have done other coursers and capstones in Coursera this was one of the poorest.
except for git and github ,nothing much is in it.
Very confusing lectures, he says you don´t have to have a basic level of excel to do the course but I didn´t find that true.
Really!?
Professor just re-iterated text and readings.
It's often not clear the point the professor of this course is trying to make.
Calls in to question the motive of the course and coursera - this seems more like marketing or pre-sales than it does education.
I listened all lessons on 1.5 or even 2.0 tempo, just to not fall asleep.
Quizzes are strange.
I do not normally remember the instructors' names, except for brilliant ones.
Poorly designed, no help whatsoever from the staff, Forum is totally worthless.
It can be good for manager and business people to better understand what technologies are available these days, but that it.
There is talk about a book, but I didn't find one within the course.
I am very disappointed with this programming course.
Lack of insights and practical information
One would be better off checking into other free, online tutorials.
I'm not sure about the value of the videos titled "Office Hours."
This course was terribly underwhelming.
The worst that I have taken so far... please change the teacher or re-do the materials explaining the concepts more!.
Or at least give more extra material to understand the concepts better.
There is 0 commitment from the TA and mentor staff.
I should have never paid for this course.
This course seems to have interesting content and presentation, but the quiz concerns the materials not covered in lectures or readings (be it required or supplementary).
I've wasted too much time on this.
1 star because Coursera wont let me take the capstone even after completing all four pre-requisite classes (this one is the fourth).
I'm dropping this course because it's just SO poorly conceived.
Objective and Professional Evaluation:If I could give this course a zero, I would have done so, but it is not possible.
No forums available but the notice about forums interrupts all the videos.
There does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone.
Discussion moderators who continually referred you back to the course material which did not contain the information that people were looking for.
People are pleading for help and not receiving any guidance or direction to help them figure things out.
Too much peer and dealing with others--not making me happy at all
There, now you have been warned.
This part of the specialization has been put together in a haste, without effort and absolutely without any care of teaching.
I get an email telling me I did not submit.
i feel less and less sincerity in coursera's mooc these days.
Very bad feedback so far, and the funny thing is that I had big expectations before the start.
Hope this will be taken as constructive feedback and not as a complaint.
The second week' s presentations are just listings of lengthy definitions and "Best practices" which in fact are mostly goals, not practices.
With the poor quality of the provided videos, my hope was that the reading would be better.
Does it ever stop?
He reads off the bullet points on the powerpoint slides without any elaboration.
It's incredibly frustrating and disheartening.
But then I took a first look: the instructor is reading formulas from a slide.
The new Coursera UI makes it impossible to download transcripts or slides of the videos.
Week 4 does not give enough explanation or extra resources and makes it unable to complete the exercises.
While there are supplementary readings, Coursera and the participating institutions need to understand that there are those who are taking courses to get more than a one page Wiki style coverage of a topic.
This course is basically about watching uninspiring videos.
All the while, Coursera keeps asking if I want to pay $45 to verify for this course.
I'm sorry but the presentations were very poor and unprepared.
The first quiz focused on rather unimportant and stuff which was NOT PRESENTED in videos, like keyboard shortcuts etc.
Do not recommend.
The AWS final assignment is a very much throw you into the deep end with no real instruction (well at least completely outdated instructions) and will expect you to swim (or more likely for most people, to drown).
I recommend the Machine Learning Course (from Bill's colleagues) at University of Washington.
I've got 95% for this course
Not enough video lectures/ explanations.
Don`t put your irrelevant politics in games
Good ones for a new teacher who may be oblivious but there is little concrete information about what those ideas look like in a class setting.
And worst of all, he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions, make pointless statements, or answer with pointless statements/answers.
A well crafted introduction of buzz-words with very little substance (Unlike the following courses on Excel and presentations)
It marked some answers as wrong that were actually correct.
I am a bit disappointed and think this course was a waste of time for me.
Professionals(btw I hold a MSc degree in Computer Engineering) cannot get anything from this.
Superficial coverage of quiz and final exam material in the video lectures.
I recommend doing Statistics with R from Duke instead.
Do not recommend!
The first two weeks were short, introductory programming lessons.
The quality of the course is superb and my experience is completely ruined by a shitty score which does not reflect my work.
also I'd like to mention the delivery of the information - its a text that's read aloud.
The peer reviewed assignments are next to useless, as there is no oversight on them.
It was particularly ironic to see an instructor exercise censorship in a Philosophy course - a domain whose objective, after all, is the pursuit of truth as well as to ask and debate the "why" of everything!
Too much introduction
Presentation skills are poor.
Do this course only for the examples in the Jupyter notebook.
The course is not very useful due to its lacking of practical examples and assignments.
I DON'T recommend this course AT ALL.
I think this course is really for people who are re-learning guitar or already have musical backgrounds.
Good material, but difficult to watch towards the end of the course.
Peer grading is just dumb (and clearly doesn't work, since I have yet to get a single assignment back).
Content was lacking
I thought the whole point of Coursera is to enhance our skills for free and chose to pay for a certificate if we wanted to.
I finished all the theory well within the 2 months into my enrolment.
This whole course is equivalent to a 2 hour seminar on "How to live more positively" presented at local community centre.
(iii) Way too much powerpoint!
I wish there were many more examples given and an applicable technique presented, that I could use as an entrepreneur.
the staff don't seem interested in this a a problem.
Content is poor too.
Lack of scientific evidence .
Processed foods have become an easy villain among many people and the idea that processed foods are dangerous to our health and the responsible for all our problems is a mistake.
This is just a very short course about office etiquette.
I couldn't review my partners because there isn't projects to review.3.
the class gave me nothing.
expected a lot more from something like PWC.
This course is not even considered as an introduction it's a complementary for those whose career is robotics , in other words the required prerequisites are more than matlab programming skills and some calculus and algebra, its assignments have many problems that cannot be solved using just the course studying.
the course doesn't give many information.
It may be because I do no have the textbook, but overall a rather poor course.
My only happiest moment in this whole course is writing this review, I couldn't wait to finish it in order to give it the 1 star rating it deserved.
What I've seen from this course so far is abandonment , that's right this course is abandon ware, no questions get answered on the forums (asked a question a month ago and still didn't get an answer) and the links are outdated (links to further documentation don't work).
I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn Machine learning since the instructors use proprietary libraries that need a license to use outside this course thus application wise what you learn her isn't transferable only the conceptual content;however, even in that there isn't much content for, since everything is an introduction here so nothing is quite useful .
If your on a tight budget and your taking this specialization you could skip this course.
Content is very condensed - but fine.
However, you need to pay to do the quizzes and even the peer assessment - something where you are contributing by reviewing other participants work.
My impression is that this guy didn't spend any time to prepare this course and just used the material/homework from a more advanced class that he did previously.
It might not be the course - it could be me!
Confusing.
But why do you ever ask this, how this relates to the topic?
Don't waste your time with this school at all!
I'm actually REALLY INTERESTED on this course, but Erica's accent is TERRIBLE.
Regretfully examples and assignments are frequently overly complex in areas which are unrelated to the subject.
The professors were hard to follow, laughed through mistakes and did not do a good job of walking through the course content.
New format makes it impossible to watch off-line.
I'm really sorry to give this rating, but I have no choice.
I have fallen asleep during 3/4th week, and it have never happened to my during any of the Coursera courses...
communication skills are poor.. i know this is not a design course but the examples shown in html are so bad u think u are watching a course from 2002.. the teacher says "frustrating" some many times, and uses so much negative word towards coding and html... maybe she hopes not desencoraje students by empathy but end up doing the exact opposite.
i would not recommend this course, not to newbies, not to oldies, not to anyone searching to have a good learning experience.
Finishing this course was painfull and i only did it because i promised myself not to abandond it.
This is the first course that will only let you grade the quiz if you purchase the course.
Useless bla-bla-bla in general words.
The material itself is fine but I have had a terrible experience working with the instructors.
I am not qualified to evaluate the course from the perspective of an experienced programmer, but I have noted that they are frustrated by clutter caused by token attempts to make this a beginner course.
My recommendation to the faculty is to completely re-engineer this whole specialization.
every week !!!
The Course is acceptable, however, it should be called, Introduction to VoIP communication or Developing VoIP applications rather than its current title.
Assignments are either super easy or never have a right answerPersonally, I will not recommend this course for other who want to understand IoT
The others?
I struggled so hard!
It was like night and day.
bad instructor
Very poor in all aspects.
Completely irrelevant material.
Try beta testing this on TRUE rank novices.
I am disappointed in the quality of the lectures in this course.
For example, the professor does not teah us directly, like all the other courses on Coursera.
This course is way too slow and boring.
The introduction is nice, but the problem is the homework design.
I would not recommend anyone take this course, let alone pay for it.
I'm done.
i can't understand what he talk about.
hard for a student (even one who has a programming background) to sit through hours of slides explaining what the functions and definitions in the language do without a layer of use context upfront.
The content jumps from specific examples to unrelated specific definitions without carrying a sense of integrating the new knowledge with any past knowledge in the course.
It seems this is gearing towards another means of making bussiness when it comes to education.
I understand that grading and providing feedback requires effort and the fees charged is required to the cover those cost, but like before we must have an option to get access to the homework, allowing us to apply our learning while it maybe be acceptable not to have any feedback or certificate on the course completion.
Currently, the closed homework policy goes against the basic objectives of MOOC and I hope it is reconsidered.
It's really not hard to find better material to learn Ruby/Rails, even just slightly better, even YouTube videos.
You will quickly become lost in the assignments and questions as they are a not a logical progression from the lecture material.
The required level of involvement was too low to be helpful.
Given this is the third (or fourth) iteration of this course, it's telling that the errors from the original release remain in the videos and quizzes.
Very Limited material.
I am just not feeling this course.
They advertise that you need couple of hours of study per week.
Some of this content is also repeated in other courses in the sequence.
This was the most poorly designed course that I have ever encountered.
not upto the mark.
Not meant for intelligent students
Grading rubric does not include areas for where extra research has been done either
The material is not pertinent to a specialty on big data technologies.
If I all I was trying to do was just read some docs and look on stack overflow I wouldn't need to take this course now would I?Poorly translated and cryptic instructions for assembling furniture are better than what you get here.
Simply copying and pasting code and explaining what every line does is not the right way of teaching any concept, especially when you are dealing with a new technology.
There were key definitions and concepts that were stated wrong in this course.
Searched on Google.. Read lots of document.
If Google itself has approved this 'Google Cloud Platform' trainings on Coursera then vola I am out.
Really poor course.
He seems at times to be delivering the lecture as a stream of consciousness rather than a properly prepared lecture: as a result he sometimes misspeaks himself, for example saying that murder trials are conducted in the High Court rather than the Crown Court, and these errors have not been picked up and corrected.
It was not a great course.
I would never again take a MOOC from U of Toronto.
too many theory and too boring
Way too many errors in the graded assignment.
!The course is designed in contradiction of all the principles it preaches--there are no forums for the students, there is no way you could contact the instructor, the instructor keeps reading badly, stammering like a first-grader, speaks monotonously and there's no interaction whatsoever!Furthermore, there are mistakes in the quizzes and you have to choose blatantly wrong options if you want to get the 100% score!Although the subject matter about Virtual Instruction is pretty interesting and the instructor made it sound like the most boring thing in the world!Many of the links are outdated or not working at all and often the documents she refers to are 10 or more years old.
Unable to start the course.
I didn't like that course because of:-weak explanations of algorithms-almost all assignments I googled, I spent all my time googling these algorithms-when code is submitted and something goes wrong It is not possible to understand what is really happened
You'll learn a lot more than this course has to offer if you consult some websites with screenwriting tutorial blogs, read books and write on your own.
I am a PhD student of theoretical film studies and and a fan of Coursera courses.
This is a scam and I can only say I am sorry I paid my money for this.
It needs a lot of design thinking itself.
I have bought the book however.
Teacher never answer forums.
i had technical problems with both coursers's online system and also with the 3rd party online coding tool
I have school, a job, and yet I'm losing all this productivity because I'm running all these damn tests hoping on the off-chance that I catch whatever weird bug it is that's failing my code.
The reader is left not knowing what the key take aways were
I wanted to actually learn about these concepts deeper, and implement them.
I also was able to complete this 6 week paid course in a few days which should not be possible.
What's the point of online education if one can only access the assignments if him has purchased the course?
The one mentor disappeared half-way through the course.
I am deeply disappointed that so much fallacious content could be distributed to individuals, on the pretext of unbiased learning.
The information is not presented well and the math is not always taught.
I did enjoy the first course, America's Written Constitution but someone was paying attention then and it was on the older format so it was better.
No one responds to email.
This is an extremely basic course.
(Which is a shame, as you'd expect a course to teach you how to use the tools you will need for the assignments.
Don't worth it !
More than a course, it seems more like 2 students learning along with you.
Be ready to do a lot independent research and learning from other sources in order to complete the weekly quiz.
The assignments ask for techniques that aren't focused on or even covered in the lectures.
Bad audio qualityPoor presentationNot for professional developers (perhaps can be fine for beginners)
Struggled through all of the lecture videos and the quizzes seemed to come out of left field.
I just wish it were better structured and supported and that I learned more about the work rather than just searching online for how to write something.
).
Was a waste of time, shame on Coursera that pre-requisite knowledge was removed from the site.
Badly formulated alternatives in the multiple choice test
There's not time to process the information and complicated terms and processes are explained in just a few seconds.
I'm disappointed as it looked like an interesting course but doesn't live up to some of the really great courses available which employ great teaching and delivery.
I would not recommend this class.
Most video's are spoken in a sort of 'Franglais' that is barely understandable, very annoying.
I figured if the rest of the course was the same, I'd be better off teaching myself with a text book.
I completed it as a part of specialization, that's the only reason.
And there are so few philosophers covered.
It would take me almost 20 to 30 minutes to make notes over a 5 minute long video.
Although my assignment would run as I understand the project should, I could not even submit it.
Despite paying for it i'm not going to bother completing it.
This was kind of a waste of my time.
Too theoretical and completely disliked it.
These problems are compounded by the uncorrected subtitles and 'transcripts' of the lectures, obviously done by somebody with no understanding of the subject.
I think that this edition is absolutely useless.
I was very excited by the topic of this course, but quite disappointed when I finally started it.
The content of this course has little to do with its promising title.
In fact.
Not worth your time or money.
The information shared doesn't even flow smoothly.
This course relies mainly on PDF slides (if I wanted to read, I would've bought a book).
The all seem like ''The faster we do this, the sooner it will be finished....''
Which practice?
I couldn't really understand his motives.
Because that's it!
While the content is very helpful and Gary does his best to make people confident to improvise in Jazz music, this course has imho two major flaws:The biggest one: assignments given and results accepted do not fit together.
it has to be reviewed
I also highly recommend "Understanding the Brain The Neurobiology of Everyday Life" which I believe was taught by the University of Chicago.
Course is not good at all.
Good course but not good from coursera to not give honor certificate like it used to give.
edx still gives..
very disappointed with coursera.
Professor is not engaging at all.
As a result you only get the most superficial understanding of the material.
So many better options out there to learn to code.
The support team fail to help in installing ... :-(
It is a great effort to try to explain writing an academic paper.
A lot of things (Ruby version controls, PhantomJS installation) from this course don't work on Mac OS X El Capitan.
Sways between incorrect definitions and buzz words to word dense academic papers.
Lectures and other material just don't cover the information needed in the course project.
These objections are well known, but are not confronted in the course.
A scholarly much sounder and deeper course is the one on Tibetan Buddhism from University of Virginia.
Such a disappointing ending to what was otherwise an enjoyable specialization.
The course is very useless, there is no meat, only water - there is no substance - only talking around the topic.
Errors and glitches in the first two quizes that aren't fixed ('Don't worry, be happy, it's just a formating error, ignore the literal text displayed and just use your imagination to interpret what we thought we meant to say') have left me too unimpressed to spend more time wondering if I need to debug my code or debug their quizes.
There are many other resources for learning python out there, and some of them take pedagogy seriously.
I lost the overall picture: it seems that a dozend methods were introduced, but I failed to understand under which preconditions each method is deployable.
I found this video on youtube (https://www.
youtube.
com/watch?v=u6aEYuemt0M) and realized that this gives me a significantly more concrete understanding of how convolutional neural networks actually function, than these lectures.
Unclear assignments unfit for an international participant base.
Exams are too easy, video lessons are boring and not engaging.
Not worth the time.
Unfortunately this is a second course, and the first part doesn't provide necessary information on what we actually do with Galaxy.
all on demand flow are bad.
The course is not rigorous enough.
The weekly lectures/assignments did little to prepare for the final assignment.
This is the worst course I have ever seen in my life, I'm ain't lying these guys use the terms which they haven't thought and they use it so frequently as if they have thought it, One who were teaching may be industrial experts and have lot's of experience, but one thing to note is:Teaching is an art...
Secondly, there was no interaction between the students and the doctor supervising the course in the discussion blogs.
There is no discussion of the context of those technologies.
I don't feel that I learned much from this course.
very boring and didn't learn anything i didn't already know.
This creates a distracted learning path that makes it difficult to follow the lessons.
This huge gap between the information given, and the information you are expected to know to solve the problems they give you is too large, I found differential equations easier than this
Virtual educators say that the students should interact with the platform every 3-4 minutes and yet they give you 15 min video to listen to and look at the same picture.
The last assignment is very poorly structured with uninformative instructions.
Completely disppointing.
He only repeated the points in the presentation!
I would not recommend this course at all.
Poorly designed assignment on data modeling did little to expand my knowledge on the topic.
(Might not be a bad idea to get the VU English department to review the lecture text as well.
For me personally, essays are just waste of time and there's nothing beneficial about them.
Another thing that bugs me is how questionably and often misleadingly are thermodynamical laws interpreted by the professors in this course.
Perfect guided course.
While I learned quite a bit from the course, I found the course to be far more difficult and frustrating than it really needed to be.
Terrible professor teaching the course, the format was poorly put together, and just wasn't overall a very good course.
(Still can't)
WHile I might have picked up more, it was only because I used resources outside the course.
The video instructions in programming in Python left quite a few gaps to figure out by reading documentation.
AND FOR ANY OTHER COURSE READ THE BAD REVIEWS FIRST (WHICH WAS MY MISTAKE).
However, this is where the "good news" ends.
Quality and length of material is mediocre.
English is horrible, and I am french...
But I would not say all animals do not have complex language systems, or we have one single origin of language.
Это Курсера?
But also here you have to be careful.
If you are completely new to website design (as I was), prepare for a steep learning curve as you will be spending many hours preparing and organising your info - the title is deceptive and misleading!Ann, Melbourne, Australia April 2016.
The role of instructors should be to "invest" the time to provide the concepts and information for the students of the course to "learn" faster than if they had to research (the planet) by themselves to find the knowledge.
Mine does a nice job explaining things, other teachers in this course aren't as talented.
I really think the expectation should be set before students sign on to the specialization, as was I wonder how many students gave up on the whole Interaction Specialization after this course.
I was unable to complete the final project of this course due to the lack of knowledge provided by the lecture videos and some of own research.
Excellent teaching, but it's not actually free.
Tableau is garbage and their assignment practice questions don't work
While the importance of "Usability" was rightly emphasized, the representation in terms of examples, case studies, etc.
Unclear if this was intentional & intended to enable participating students to be more patient and tolerant of imperfections around them.
There are so many different examples to pick form, but I'll just pick a few here.
Certainly not a beginners course.
I took the next series of course coz I saw that there are other tacher
I appreciate suggestions for improvement but, I felt that more critique was on my teaching style than my writing.
looks like a great course
I should suggest my fellow Coursera students not to waste their money and time for this course.
After 11 weeks of work I am ready to start something different.
The pronunciation of the lectors is more than awful!
Only $50, but it was so terrible I did not even want to finish it.
It gives a quick background on Galaxy and its softwares.
There are no practical sessions.
This is certainly not an-depth look at smartphone technology.
I was looking forward to taking the entire Ruby On Rails specialization, now I'm not so sure.
The book could be more direct in how it gives you the lessons.
Thank you.
Withdrew early.
In its current form, the inclusion of this course in the Interaction Design specilisation is represents an error of judgement.
followed instructions to download twice waste of time both times still kept getting an error never got past this to continue with the course so didn't learn anything other than there is little support out there to resolve the problem i think because the course is not monitored or if it is well then more fool me!
Very poor course, badly taught and terrible value for money.
Not to mention, the feedback is minimal and not all that helpful.
don't waste your time, just touch supper surface about this technologies, most time just mention the name of these technologies
This specialization is definitely not on par with other specializations I have done.
BLUF: There are better uses for your money and time.
I thought the content layout for Courses 1 and 2 were okay.
I didnt feel that I learned anything at all.
unable to do assignment wo today is last date
I'm sure live it's different but when you're taking it online and parts are
Speaking of which, a search of the general forums indicate that this has been an ongoing issue since the latter half of 2015.
I couldn't get passed the Starbuck assignment, I don't really understand why the choose such a bad application of digital marketing.
I wish they spent more time on the content of videos and less on the silly effects and 30-second intro and outro sequences.
What's more, with no knowledge on how to do it, you are supposed to assess the works of your peers.
I could see only this unit is open for past many months.
Lots and Lots of work.
The course poorly understands the scientific method, and its main effort is to wield unconvincing critiques of science so as to elevate the status of religion in general and Creationism in particular.
I am afraid this is going to be a rather negative review.
Very linmited (I would say insufficient) and inconsistent use of background data (diagrams, equations, symbols,pointers) on the board to support what was been talked about.
Too expensive for such a simple course
Startinng it now
The Course suit for a beginner but a bit fragile, I expect more about building a usable model.
Or maybe I just didn't want to listen to them.
A University Course should be a place where you advance your knowledge with a "limited and reasonable" amount of time spent in the course.
Why does it use a challenging programming language that is not the point.
The lectures and Swirl exercises are extremely easy to understand and follow, but then the assignments are incredibly complicated and difficult.
It would have been much better as a 30 minute video without all the fluff and unsubstantiated inferences.
Finally this weekend the Jupiter notebook worked and I started the first assignment.
However i am quite disappointed with the instructor and the contents he put together.
They didn't really tell you weather you understood the concept or not.
It is lacking in terms of content, pedagogy, and production.
This is another course in UCSD's "Big Data" introductory course.
From the start it seemed politically correct and ideological.
Do not take pay for this course or program at all.
3) the disconnect between the lessons and the assignments wouldn't be an issue if the instructor could be bothered to respond to forum questions.
Poorly designed and demonstrated.
It is extremely WEAK in terms explaining those concepts.
I became so frustrated and actually angry at how difficult this course is designed I decided to quit.
I guess this is good if you want to be a substitute at a middle school or high school, but it's not for me.
Also, there is close to no teacher participation in the module I took and there are no mentors or student teachers (that might change in future classes I would hope, but no guarantees) and there was close to zero feedback of my work or even in the discussion area and no authoritative feedback.
I try to ask for help and then mentors only reply with I cant help you because of the Honor code.
This shouldn't be as confusing as Coursera has made it.
The big assignment at the end contains instructions that are outdated and incomplete.
Very poor course... You can pass it in a one day even if you never program Python.
Additionally, it is full of statements that are not supported by the historical facts.
Not at all what I expected--big disappointment
Using a proprietary library instead of widely used libraries and discouraging the use of open source widely used libraries.
The quiz and assignment are poorly designed.
I don't think this is the best way to learn java!
I don't see how the assignments would make me a more creative person.
Nice try but it doesn't work :(Best regards,Dr.
Actually i want rate 0, as the instruction for the installation of new tools are quite vague and misleading
I wasn't aware that if you audit the course you were not allowed to complete the quizzes as other courses offer this option.
I just need help.
Not so lucky.
It is completely misleading.
makes it very confusing.
Some questions in the quiz for module 2 are unclear and seem unrelated to the course work.
that it's very difficult to follow without making a line of code myself... Also it is not clear what the educators expect as a pre-requisite for taking this course.
Local builds work fine with apps working as expected and tests pass.
Mstly theory
The organizer impressed me as only wanting to sell copies of his book on dog behavior and used the course as his vehicle.
The instructor, at least, seems to have zero knowledge about software development.
There is no help.
Among the things the course requires are two (three?)
not exciting, instructor too stiff and looked like reading a paper
Hands down the worst course on Coursera.
In addition, you must have strong matlab programming skills and be familiar with much matlab functionality in order to debug some of the assignments.
I don't have expertise to analyse data on my own... unfortunately.
As I applied for a financial help here, I won't complain much :).
Very detailed
No support on the merits.
uses and ancient version of python
I should have included mathatical models and ways to relate them with our day to day life.
Thanks
There is a gap in the material presented and the skill set needed to complete the assignments.
worst course of the specialization.
The learning curve is too steep to be useful to the majority of potential registrants.
What a huge pain.
Few content, bad quality, many mistakes in the material, no programming assignments, poor support.
Definitely not worth the money.
Difficult to follow with no live coding.
You are not introducing Swift, you are introducing xcode (and doing a terrible job of it).
The videos are actually slide shows and use too few screenshots.
Pre-coded stuff isn't good either, as it's very hard to comprehend, even with the professor's explanations, which also don't seem to be aimed at beginners.
I am disappointed in the outcome.
I expected something that is not academic-like explanation, which I can't find it here.
Please bring back those explanations style similar to the first course.
I was very disappointed because in order for me to move to the next module I have to pay to unlock some of the course materials.
The official IDE for Android development is Android Studio now.
I could import the project for Lab1 but I'm unable to compile the tests and the program with Android Studio, I get a ton of errors.
Hardly everyone post on the forums, I also check the Classmates map.
You can pass the quizzes just by watching the videos.
Audit the course BEFORE you pay any money!
Terrible englishQuite diffuse contentNo reading texts
Education should be uplifting and positive and an area where individuals can ask question and receive help and not be scolded for asking help or asking questions like a beat down dog.
The instructions for the assignments are impenetrable at best.
Basing on the first videos, I would not recommend this course to anyone believing that "You are expected have basic computer literacy skills, such as knowing how to send & receive emails and browse the web".
The lector is robotic, the slides look outdated, listener is bored after 10 min of watching.
It is not possible to build embedded system with OS after finishing it.
The only redeeming quality to this course has been the homework, but you can find them online or come up with them on your own.
Unable to even start it... Click on videos of week 1 and nothing happens
If I am auditing this class why can't the quizzes be free also?What happened to free Coursera?
Awful.
Totally not what I expected.
My experience with Teradata has been awful.
Cons:-Too dated - links to many of the materials are unavailable.-Instructors knowledge of some the models he cover is questionable (regression)Pros:-Covers a lot of materials
This is the fist time I have seen an Institution do this.
If you are determined to get the specialization certificate, you should definitely start the final assignment as early as possible.
For the money - we are getting some shorter version of a bigger course.
I thought that there wasn't enough time to cover all the material to make this course good.
couldn't understand a little what was the message you wanted to pass on students.
couldn't stand more than a week of this course.
Apologies for being over-rude
I've done two other courses on Coursera with Rice University and the difference to this course is huge, while I would wholeheartedly recommend the Rice Intro to Python courses, Don't do this course, it is not coherently presented or graded.
Peer reviewed assignments are a joke.
I did not like this course for the following reasons:1- bad course design structure2- so confusing and inappropriate sequence3- super fast without providing any intuition4- no fundamental explanation5- course could be longer and spend enough time in each subject
Almost all of the methods were deprecated by the time I was taking this course.
I just do not feel a connection with this professor - he is constantly plugging his book and the website.
No system, no methods in place.
Was expecting a course on using Excel.
video lecture says to refer to accompanying excel spreadsheet, but no spreadsheet available).
THE CERTIFICATION WILL TAKE OVER A YEAR AND COST AROUND $400.
I dont recommend this course to anyone.
The course content is not up-to-the mark.
An assignment was submitted by the deadline but was never reviewed.
Not at all up to the usual Coursera standards.
In getting feedback from my peer review which I am very open to feedback however, I guess I did not appreciate being told what I should or shouldn't do in my classroom with my kids.
Completely app/cloud-based or forget it.
I imagine you are loosing more and more people due to this.
some other time, a concept is explained so fast I wonder whether i should have known objective-C in order to follow this course...
No need for videos if all the teacher does is reading his slides.
It takes days before there is any response at all.
The assignment descriptions and requirements are sparse and vague.
Bad logic.
Class content poorly related to the exams.
Is this a joke?
This is only theory related to the evolution of the systems.
We just do not become certified if we have taken the class for audit rather than credit.
We did not learn nearly enough in the course to be able to tackle that.
And I'm sure he's killing it teaching statistics and R Studio at Uni, but using R studio to such a standard just doesn't seem like the everyday work an HCI designer would do.
His hand writing is poor, and he does a lackluster job of explaining what exactly he's doing.
Finally, pure lecture with no notes is almost impossible to learn, as there's nothing to read and study.
I'd rate this course a 1/10, take the course on iTunes from Caltech instead.
You will learn nothing from this.
I have an undergraduate degree in finance, an MBA, and another master’s degree in Data Analytics.
The initial lessons were rather chaotic.
Also, the exercises were quite tricky for a beginner.
Sorry, the guy in the first video doesn't blink, which is very weird.
There is insufficient peers to review.
This course does not live up to the high value that I've come to enjoy and expect at Coursera.
I mean, professors in that course are presenting their own research!
The instructors did not do a good job at explaining how to use Wordpress.
I would not recommend this to anyone!
This is my first course in coursera.
Cons:Information redundancy, unnecessary required reading.
Extend some information that only need few hours to study to a 6 weeks courses.
Pros:There are some useful basic concepts & frames
Executive Summary: Do not spend time on this course if you have minimal common sense and have read at least one article on Data Science.
I finished the 11 week course "Machine Learning - Stanford University - by Andrew Ng" 2 months ago, which was such a great course!
The no-feedback exam is misleading, difficult to pass.
I hardly understand what they are saying without subtitles.
Thx for your all precious effort.
However, the quality of the lectures is not good at all.
The lecturer just reads aloud the text on screen, without fleshing out the concepts therein or providing any explanation.
I don't recommend you to take any course from this institute.
This leads to studends copying these answers into their assignments without them learning anything.
The other flaw is that Gary is very brief in his explanations.
This is a bait and switch.
I wanted to know at what age/weight you switch to 2% milk.
Examples in his notes were not well explained!
It even claims that creationism should be regarded as a viable alternative to evolution!
The course is too short to cover the subject so it covers nothing in the end.
The programming assignment have no help, whatsoever it's "do it" any language.
There are also little to no resource links etc.
poor teacher..
Way to technical
The final assignment is ambiguously described.
The lecturer often introduces concepts that are specific to these types of neural networks without explaining what they are.
How does that even begin to fulfil the promises of the caption?We have paid as much for this course as for the previous three.
There are no TAs, no help, nothing.
The free version of the course is far more restricted than other courses I've taken, the content wasn't brilliant, and it wasn't really more advanced than other tutorials with far better presenters which can be found online for free
It's useless and lacking enthusiasm.
I did like this course however it is very very basic.
i fell asleep half the time.
This 7-week course can be easily completed in an hour.
I learned nothing from this course that I did not already know about python.
This course is strictly for beginners.
I am having a very difficult time finishing this course.
Now aday everyone knows What is there in Smartphone.
It is not acceptable for you to just say that they contain errors and not point out where all of the errors in the slides are.
Since I am not a paying participant, I could not take the quizzes, so I finished watching the videos in less than a day.
In addition, there are NO collateral or supporting materials provided.
I would not be surprised if Yahoo!
The only difference is that they explain the science behind the techniques, which in terms of practical application is not very useful at all.
Stop advertising this as a beginning course, or restructure it such that it is more appropriate for beginners.
At first the presentations are really on a semi professional level (copy & paste codes, making errors without knowing the cause).
First of all, I don't know WHY I'm failing the test cases, I just am.
No examples, no comparisons, no detailed approaches.
Lastly, scriptwriting has a significant difference with other humanities course.
The capstone had as much work each week as the other courses had in the entire 6 week course.
The instructors did not present any further information and referred students to third-party resources (ie, Investopedia and Youtube).
The material is disorganized jumping from one topic to another and back.
There was no care in detail or discussion or presentation.
I would be reticent to take a job with Scala.
This course is the least content rich of the series, so far.
It accomplishes the exact opposite.
With regards to that Chinese Restaurant field trip.
Worse than Power Point.
Never did.
And why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos, and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments?
They're full of errors.
I learned more from the free Khan academy than from this course.
You coul pick any book about game design and you will learn more of game design in the first ten pages.
No details have been served.
Videos aren't of good quality and the tools aren't concrete enough to be useful.
The course lacks of explanation and it's very difficult to follow.
Quizzes are exceedingly simple - 10 questions with only two possible answers each.
no feedback is provided when you ask something in the forums, ever.
When you flag a milestone because of technical issues you won't be ever answered (even when you upload screenshots as proof).
The practical exercises with spreadsheets are poorly explained and even contradicted, especially as far as cutting and/or rounding integers are concerned.
The course material itself is enjoyable, but the quizzes don't work properly.
The course is pretty light on technical details and there could [and perhaps should] have been much more beyond-the-scenes content, as well as references to specific documents and events in order to justify this course's existence.
In other words, if you are a techie and are indeed interested in this topic, chances are that you already know most of the material taught.
Not happy about course 5 & 6 got cancelled.
you MUST have intermediate to advanced knowledge of statistics and math.
Much more emphasis on statistical analysis than on experimental design.
The assignments themselves seem to be very helpful but the tutorials did no help of achieving these assignments.
I had a hard time following the instructor despite that I've completed all the certificate for python from University of Michigan.
Rather disappointing.
Course closed and they say I have to enroll in the next course.
I keep wasting my time with tech issues.
Test questions for week 3 are incorrect and do not match video / reading.
I was actually planning to purchase the specialization - just as a thank you gesture.
Having no background or frame of reference for best practices in syntax, logic, etc, and very little information in the lectures or supplementary material to help, I found these to be almost impossible to complete.
Furthermore, there's no mechanism or provision in the course to review the assignments after they're submitted.
It was often difficult to see how the readings related to the projects.
Also, there are over 3 hours of videos in the 1st week plus 3 quizzes and a programming assignment.
Not very well put together.
huge waste of time, they will give you very little information and what is expected for you to be able to do with that information is astronomical, you will never learn any of the details of how computing works, how functions work, the mechanism behind these computations, or anything.
When I ask questions on the forums, the first word I think when I read mentors' explanations is "cryptic."
I do not find very interesting this course.
Many drop out by the end of the course.
Problematic to complete assignments
Basically a couple of guys have an unorganized discussion about swift.
Should be ideally directed towards helping prepare for recognized certifications like PMP, Prince2 etc.
poorly constructed, too simplistic and too slow
Poorly prepared course.
A very high-level introduction, but the analytical part is totally missing
Trust me, videos discussing open defecation and child marriage get old fast.
So, he only started checking in once a week after I had already nearly completed the whole course.
Total waste of time.
I am trying from last 5 days to start my enrolled course but error message is displaying Everytime.
make the other ones free
Taking this course in January/ February 2017, I found it to be jumbled, out-dated and frustrating.
Materials are presented in a chaotic, roundabout way, which is neither chronological nor thematic, leaving huge lacunae.
This course needs some serious adjustments, either with the prerequisites needed for success in this course, or with the material within the assignments themselves.
New videos should be shot and inspiration taken from more instructive and interesting guides, like The Cartoon Guide to Statistics by Gonick & Smith.
I really don't have the feeling that I learned much that would help me in getting "From Idea to Marketplace".
)You can get the same amount of knowledge by reading two or three Wikipedia pages.
If possible, I would give this course zero stars.
I lacked some enthusiasm
Using a borrowed laptop, I was not permitted to upgrade to a new version by laptop owner.
If you don't have background in statistics, you will have a very difficult time.
But, It's SIMPLY TERRIBLE to force people to pay to be able to do the quizzes.
There's a lack of domain of the matter by the instructor and some concepts are poorly explain and incorrectly defined.
This course has been dumbed down so much that no moderately intelligent person should be subjected to it.
It was then also my impression from the peer reviews, that some students without prior knowledge were just lost.
There are many great tutorials on the web which offer more insights and give students a much more fundamental knowledge than this course.
I thought this course would be more fun and interesting but I find it VERY repetitive with the Fundamentals of Graphic Design.
too long
It's nice to have a personal point of view but it is difficult to follow the process then.
Quite confused during the majority of this course, especially after how clear the first course was.
I can't start this course
This is untrue, as the final programming assignment does require it.
C
Not a positive act to make people pay to be able to participate in the quizzes.
It's nice that it offers resources and links however, I wanted to take a course and get a certificate in one at my level to prove that I can learn beyond a high school biology level.
You can't do assignments using the lecture materials.
I was looking for a course that would teach me how to write professional emails and have professional phone conversations, like which words I should use, what common sentences are or how to build up professional sentences.
It is a common sense that a writer has to be detail-oriented with recommendations?
One moment he's talking about physics, and in the same sentence he's suddenly talking about whether the game should have a crafting system.
Very shallow coverage, doesnt have the scope to be an entire Course!
Lectures were poor and provided no insights
The instructor clearly knows the material, the class just does not do a good job of transfering that knowledge.
There were also no discussion forums of any kind available.
You learn the most by searching online tools each time you encounter a problem while solving a quiz problem or following the steps the instructor did.
You should tell people before they enroll that, to take the quizzes, they must pay.
Or any other really, really, really cool retrieval that I can't think of right now.
This guy needed an Instructional Designer to help him condense and build this course into something digestible.
The course lacks a critical analysis element and the video lectures are unstructured.
Very hard to follow.
I am an engineer and I use matlab and stata for data analysis and currently taking Machine Learning course by Stanford which is fabulous.
Awful course.
No examples or case studies or insights.
very disappointed in the class.
The worst!
Quite a few of the homework items require guessing as the answers don't align to the results of the latest tools they have you use.
The assignment is meaningless.
its boring
Don't waste 35$
Based on the prerequisites of the Software Security course, the Usable Security course, in its current form, is too elementary to be appropriate for people who have the experience/knowledge required for the rest of the courses in this specialization.
Instructions could have improved and slides could have improved rather than using chalkboard.
As a manager in an IT consultancy, I can't justify sending my personnel through this course, even at $69 per course.
Other courses offer additional slides and scripts that are aligend with the course videos and allow the students to look things up.
Also some data persons, i knew, didn't understand that either.
The course is a wonderfulBut the idea of a peer and the final assignment a very badYou need to wait ... for several days and a waste of your time in order to be assessed by other peopleThese people may be incompetent and give you a zero for no reasonAnd lost your effort and your time
I feel cheated, I have lost both time and money at the same time.
WoW awful presentation but great instructor.
"much better than the data science with R concentration provided also by John Hopkins.
Some interesting concepts, but way to simplistic in my opinion.
It is impossible to submit quizes and programming assignments without purchasing the course.
the tutorials is not for average students, it takes a very high skill to understand them .
And you will be disappointed if you do.
[I am speaking from my personal experience about this course.
In one instance, two of the options available are contradictory to each other, however the accepted answer was the one involving both.
The instructors rushed through the Javascript part.
I'm not talking about the odd question here or there, I'm talking about consistently throughout every assignment.
This course is useless and perhaps even harmful.
The professors would have done much better if they had taught the class in their native Chinese language and then got a really good translator to make subtitles in English.
I tried turning off the sound and just watching the presentation while reading the subtitles, but even this was so badly done in terms of language and presentation, that although I desperately wanted to take a course in advanced neurobiology, I felt that this course could actually destroy my love for the subject or teach me things that are incorrect because of language mistakes.
If you are not a native speaker of English then by all means steer even further clear as you will learn some very bad English habits and pronunciation.
I'm sure the profs' English ability is fine for collaborating with other professionals who already know the material, but teaching in English was a big mistake.
Again, I highly suggest they re-do the entire thing in Chinese and get really good translations and subtitles made and then I think it could be an awesome course.
This is so frustrating I consider I will unroll this course.
?
I was working on the first problem of the 4th assignment.
I've just wasted 2 hours going through repetitions of what I'll learn, but not actually learning anything.
Disgusting.
For me personally, the whole course was a complete waste of time.
Mostly just an ad for the instructor's startup.
You must pay in order to access the assignments and the professor's in-browser python sandbox.
boring and helpless
The quiz do not relate to the lectures....
a lot of thinks need to be explore in documents outside of the course and the knowledge of the student has to be higher.
It is really basic course, I expected much more even if this is offered only for $29.. (the cheapest course in the specialisation)
No one is taking care of it.- The lecturer's English is not good, but understandable.
The course contents might be interesting, but now I'm dropping this course because they are not explaining any concepts but are just giving facts to memorize.
I was disappointed.
You must have more knowledge concerning matlab than any of the course material or pointers provides.
Also it seems that the course was created in a rush and lacks a lot of polishing(*).
It seems shallow and disintegrated to me.
Also, the stuff about social norms is very confusing and hard to understand.
I abandonned this course because the instructions were not clear enough.
I will always like to learn something new.
I had a strong motivation to follow the course, but honestly had to drop without completing the second lecture.
This is the first Coursera course that I have ever wanted to rate zero stars.
O, I forgot they also include a link to a 4 years old TED talk, FUn but not really relevant.
This course is a disgrace to Coursera.
However, I expect a bit more when paying $500 for a specialisation.
The first module in the series was too basic but at least there was a lot of coding involved.
This capstone is unavailable most part of the year.
I can barely afford 50 dollars, I'm unemployed and no one will hire.
You will get a better explanation if you take each subject and youtube the videos on each subject.
To shame!
This is really atrocious.
I was ready to give 2 or 3 stars in this review.
Unfortunately, on the last assignment, the sample code and scripts was buggy (even towards the end of the course after it had been pointed out to the staff), and inconsistently written.
The final project submit script would not work and it was a trial and error troubleshooting to understand why.
There is value in asking students to learn on their own, but this course goes much too far with that, giving problem sets that are virtually unsolvable without prior experience in data wrangling in R or some other data language.
Exercises are worded such, that even the questions are a challenge to understand.
A rather non-engaged teacher ho does not know what goes on with the reviews.
This is a very bad course I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as it doesn't concern to any coding.
And, by the way, too much stories.
I am a complete newbie, I didn't know one thing about IoT before engaging in this course.
Too basic and too focused on 'farmers market' thinking.
A 16 minute video of slides, with only a couple of minutes of narration in total with what seems like about 20 links to random articles over the internet Links to articles to read would be fine if done well, but with very little to join them up and link them back to the subject at hand is a bit boring.
Too much material to get done in time frame given for full-time working parent.
This review is for Coursera.
The lectures are insufficient, the homework instructions are incorrect, the autograder is terrible.
Teacher is boring.
THIS IS AN AWFUL EXERCISE in frustration due to incomplete details.
There are dozens of students trying to install Pentaho and failing.
The intro video just really put me off.
What I learned in the first course could is useless information.
Please improve the assignment quality.
This course literally killed me....
Using subtitles didn't help either as many words came up unintelligible.
Some lectures are just right for the public in general but most of them seem to be built from common sense, there´s where I wonder if the American people are so unliterate on food issues.
I could complete the course by looking at it on-and-off over one weekend.
The material that is presented is presented well, but there's not enough of it.
For reference, part 1 of the robotics specialization had over twice as much lecture content (by time) and then lots of supplementary material in addition to that, quizzes that required some thinking, and more relevant and at least slightly harder programming assignments.
It may be relevant for someone with very limited knowledge about food, but for anyone who is moderately informed and interested in food, there is not much to learn here.
Overall this course was very shallow and only touched the surface on the matters discussed.
The professor seems to have gathered some information about the version history of iOS and android platforms, thrown it onto some slides, and then reads from those slides.
The first three weeks are totally trivial.
And they take money for this (if you want to say you "completed" the course)!!!
I though the class focused too much on enumerating various names of technologies rather than describing them in depth.
There's no thought required, just regurgitation of info from the lectures.
Also, the entire week 1 lectures are HORRIBLE.
I find this to be a very poor teaching method.
The lectures are ok.
Unfortunately:At least one of the coding assignments has a significant bug in the termination condition.
This course and material does not articulate the 'Google Cloud Platform' offerings.
And it was too late for anything, really...
Un-organized, scattered non professional course.
There was no such a thing in the first two courses (by the way, I gave high rates for both).
Am I going to search them on the internet?
Maybe a good course, but you need to be an IT crack to be able to install the software and make it works.
starting from week2 the way of explaining the materials isnt good
It looks like coursera has asked the professor to add a programming assignment to the course and he had 3 minutes to choose what it could be.
It shouldn't be advertised in coursera as it is.
Ah, forgot to mention that no one replies to the forums,actually no one uses them.
I think the subject is very interesting but this course gives a really bad advertising to Coursera, the university and the professor.
It needs more work before it's deployed on the platform.
I am going to try another Coursera course in the same kind of subject I hope it won't be the same.
It's not fair for us learners and other course providers who want to revolutionize online learning experience.
Poorly organized course.
Glad I didn't pay for this course!
Would never recommend.
But of course there's lots of interesting examples.
The teacher is useless and you only get peer-feedback.
How their features change over the time.
I personally think that it is useless because you really do not learn anything.
First of all, I really enjoyed Professor Ittner's presentations.
A course of poor quality.
Many information provided are inaccurate, and the course doesn't teach neither programming concepts for beginners, nor high or even intermediate training for other developers.
In my opinion, It's a waste of time.
Regardless of the effort put in on assignments, peer reviews are inconsistent, unguided and poor as a result, bringing down the final grade one is likely to obtain on a course.
I wanted to do the whole specialty, but after this first one i was so disappointed that i will stop.
Course did not meet my expectations.
The course requires good knowledge of statistics as a pre-requisite.
Poorly written quizzes.
The peer-review rubrics need adjustments.. it's very hard to grade anyone this way.
It is clear to me that if I am to do data analysis, then I will need a different set of tools; but because this specialization is taught entirely around R (the lectures are about R, not about higher-level concepts), then this specialization is not useful to me.
Lots of students can't count sentences, can't see and generally are very negligent in evaluating the work of others.
I would not recommend this course because the video lessons are quite poor.
The topics are so complex, there is simply no way to convey their message in just about 5 minutes.
the course delivery is regrettably boring.
In 5 weeks you have time to cover in details all the aspects of sustainable cities: energy, transport, waste, building, sharing economy.
The little useful information there is, is not structured clearly and thus it's harder to learn.
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment
They are teaching little things with long videos.
It's clear that the instructors don't care about student's actually learning anything.
This is never mentioned in the course.
The question does not have a unique yes/no solution.
Not the best course for beginners.
Coffee must!!!
It was my first course I actually paid for and it turned out to be the least useful one.
The Subject is fun.
I guess you can find much much better book about bioinformatics, and as this course is nothing more then a book i recommend a better one.
Too much theory less practical things.
I was frustrated that I had to opt out of the course.
Worst course on coursera.
Unfortunately, this specific course lacks in-depth information and problems and exercises in order to get an individual to explore the wide subject, that is, statistics.
Would have liked to do the assignments if they weren't all locked by payment requirements
This course is more on the electronics and embedded systems end of IoT, as opposed to a high-level perspective.
Speaker glosses over them without giving concrete examples2) The structure of the course is poorly configured.
I will update the stars as the weeks progress!
It was very disappointing to pay for certification and not be able to get it due to issues with the course developers ( a lack of understanding of how coursera works, it's clear they did not care to adapt to a 5 week course) and peer reviewed activities proposed that took over 6 weeks to get done.
Too elementary.
For some of quiz questions, you feel like you are dumb because you can not make connection between lectures and quizzes.
Disappointing, thought it would be more involved, perhaps with a real presentation graded by other participants in the course.
I feel robbed.
please provide the complete 5 unit details .
assingnments are not grading .
so i do not have reason to study something that can't finish
not enough material to be consider a course
duh
This course requires that you already are a manager or are in a position very similar to a manager.
For a real cornerstone project, I expect that more than 4 weeks would be necessary in order to be able to build a good app, since many of us are doing this on our spare time.
I feel sad that I had the misfortune of signing up for this course before it was made, but hope that you will take our collective criticism and make a good course out of this for future students.
One thing is for sure - avoid attending finance at university of Geneva by all costs.
Poorly designed and explained.
Other people in the forums have shown they have the same problem posted over a month ago but nothing.
This course, starting from week 3 in NOT for beginners at all.
Thank you for this course.
Language is mainly French in slides and subtitle is not that helpful.
Instead of spending time outside to read the notes, it was better to prepare helpful slides for students to understand better what you are talking about.
Though there is a lot of talk on what research is, no actual advice is given on how to write a sound research statement.
Also the assignments were impossible for a beginner.
We didn't have any feedback.2.
Thanks!
So I fully understand code architecture, but absolutely hate coding by hand.
I hope the other courses are not like this.
I rated it one star for a couple of reasons.1- I have been in software for many years and I know about software design.
Very very introductory.
Beware: upgrade / fee required for last two exams.
Yet most of the times when I was still searching for answers, looking up similar introductory videos in Youtube were far more helpful (and I didn't have to pay to watch them).
The assignments are poorly worded because the instructions are not always very clear, which in my opinion set up a lot of learners including myself for failure.
At best, it's a bitter pill you can swallow if you already know the concepts.
This course is the worst one in this specialization.
It will fail because the code is looking for things you haven't written yet.
Too much of chit chat.
The teachers have a strong Spanish accent and they fail in what they try to teach: improving.
extremely boring teachers
The course material is interesting (3/5) but the assignments rely heavily on reviewing the work of other students which severely detracts from the course.
The other modules that I have done in this specialisation have been great.
I recommend it to anyone!
The Professor's teaching is clear and comprehensible but the depth of the course content cannot meet the university level, especially from a worldwide renowned school like Wharton.
Its very boring.
I didnt understood anything until by myself and with tutorials I could do it.
This Course is bad!
I am giving 1 star to this MOOC because giving 0 is not an option.
The "savoir relier protocol" might be efficient when taught face to face in a classroom but as a MOOC it is a massive waste of time and money (I paid for the capstone project and I'm feeling robbed).
I learnt absolutely nothing.
This MOOC is a major disappointment from a school such as HEC.
Sorry to say but this particular course doesn't even begin to compare.
Need to do to the teaching of machine learning what ALEKS is doing to the teaching of mathematics.
The instructor is about as convoluted as you can possibly get with his explanations.
Please improve on this module so that it is more enjoyable for learners who really want to learn.
Instructor, Dr. Chuck, is terrific.
there is never a tension between usability and effective functioning of a system (that can't be resolved with correcting the usability).
It is irresponsible to suggest, for example, that a user selected memorable password is generally adequately secure without also covering ways that an interface can guide/nudge the user to create a secure password.
I accomplished some themes and now what?
This class should give you some early training on R before throwing it at you in the next course without enough training.
This is ridiculous.
There should of course be a similar amount of lectures on more advanced topics like current best practises for UI design, the Location API which was promised, and other interesting things that provide the building blocks for a state of the art iOS app.
The main lecturer, Professor Adam Gearey, clearly knows his subject well but is a terrible communicator.
Thank you very much!
besides the major technical issues and lack of information before the postponed start of the course and minor technical issues, the way of teaching is well adapted to on-site classes where you can sit in study groups solving the problems together; the given examples have partly little relevance and do not help to solve the assignments and according to the staff the best way to solve assignments is by using google (or stackoverflow or whatever) - really?!
Terrible lecture videos with many typos, absence of lecture notes, absence of course staff on a discussion forum.
Back and forward jumps in time are common.
- In this course, using python 2.
x- The whole course in Chinese, no English subtitles- There are no additional materials or information- There is nothing - only the Chinese
I know the teachers are Italians & English is not their first language and that is fine.
Absolute rubbish, avoid and spend your money elsewhere.
Literally just reading from some very high level slides no dept to the course.
But I think that paying for this course is a waste of money.
Quiz 3 is so ambiguous that I am giving up.
Course content is way too easy and inadequate to do any useful work.
I was expected to be quizzed for which parameters to tune, how it sounds and alike, not this particular crap.
The course modules are too long and at times what the speaker wants to share gets confusing
Not what I was expecting as Inference.
Very disappointing to see such a basic course being offered by big names as Stanford University.
Why am I paying for something when I have to use other sources to better explain.
The 90-second breaks don't work very well.
no additional insight, nothing.
Very theoretical, lack of clear structure and arguments, sadly, one of the weakest courses I've seen on Coursera.
The almost contents aren't related to communicating data science result.
By contrast, I'm currently following a Futurelearn course which is a repeat iteration of the original material (that's how online courses are viable - I understand that) BUT which the educator cared about enough to updated with topical material from the very week in which we were following it (Week 1 of President Trump)!It would have been far better to have gone into the Common Law course with clear historical anchors (e.
g.
Uninspired - not looking forward to her next class.
Keep up the great work, you all look like you know what you're doing.
I can't figure out what, and there doesn't seem to be any way of finding out.
The course has a very important content.
Omg, I really want to learn all this but can't stand him talking.
Cannot go ahead without having the Lesson 1 information.
The machine grading itself gave you no clue as to where you went wrong.
For learning mediums like this, you have to start strong.
All of the things that make Coursera valuable - videos with inline quizzes, ability to download content, the exam format, peer assessment - are missing.
Not a course that helps you solve wicked problems which do not have solutions that will come suddenly one fine day and ones that require more thought effort and brainstorming.
The course is very basic, videos contain a lot of repetitions and quiz questions are too easy (in addition, I believe that there are too much negative questions).
IT'S LITERALLY 100% LUCK!
$450 for this course and they can't even bother to make sure that the quizzes are scored correctly?
I guess I just wanted more.
In addition, the quizzes are so easy as to be silly.
The highest video production values of any class I've seen on Coursera so far.
I learned next to nothing from this course; the professor just rambles on and on jumping schizophrenically from aspect of aspect.
Imagen if all the guests had been men!!
It could be more interactive
Seems like the quality of this specialization goes down with every course.
Whatever happened to maintainability principles ?I have now lost all interest in completing the course because by week 3 I might as well be doing a course in advanced Arabic.
Meaning a student could take a full 8 courses over a year and then fail when the teachers finally look at all the work in the second capstone.
We've also been waiting months for the next course in the specialisation to begin, again without any communication.
As it is, I gladly clicked the unenroll button after 5 mins into the start of the instructor's week three video.
If you want to code anything like business applications (like I did) I wouldn't do this course.
Because pixel manipulation wasn't something I was interested in (in the JavaScript section) at all I found the course really boring but it was too late to pull out.
Yes, It should be done from time to time, but not each time.
IMHO a very superficial course.
Lots of outdated material (user-generated content was a big thing 5 to 10 years ago, not anymore).
Absolutely useless course
I have always loved the Coursera courses that I have taken, but this one is dramatically below the standard.
It looks like concepts that are taught are picked at random and stuffed into the course.
Professor Bushee did not make the first 3 weeks really easy to get through.
There is a book for Regression Models but but it's a real mess.
If I didn't need the certificate, I would definitely not waste my time on this course.
Poor alignment between assignments and lectures.
It is very important to clarify the content of a somewhat titled misnomer.
Outdated course that needs a lot of changes to your code and in releases so you can follow professors code.
A lot of people had same issues.
This is basically his class syllabus transferred to a MOOC!
Coursera really needs to rethink its approach to teaching.
DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE - THE guy who reads (not teaches) the course, Justin-Nicholas Toytama is horrendous.
(2) Some of the quiz questions I don't find useful.
IoT is mentioned just for marketing and promotion.
The cloud computing service with amazon described in the course is not free anymore.
Two days later and still no available.
The course cost too much for the gain of knowledge.
Very useless course.
I have such a great interest in this topic, but listening to her makes me want to rip my eyeballs out.
Reading the text book gives more understanding.
I've used Coursera for a few other courses and thought they were reliable but this makes me think otherwise and I feel like such an idiot for paying $200 for this COMPLETE GARBAGE.
The instructor is not actually the professor himself, and they do lots of mistakes in the videos.
Actually, I found way better explained videos on youtube for free.
The assignments of this course are poorly developed and don't reflect what is discussed in the videos well.
Of course I am doing my own work duh!
I took the first course of the specialization with David and this is the complete opposite.
Very fast pace with no support.
I'd rather go deeper in AngularJS, NodeJS or Ionic, after all this is a course for a mid level, so you should go to another course to take the basics and here a more advanced level.
Instructor voice is too low and intro music is too high.
Video quality is bad.
Course content is for very beginners people, beginners to programming not only to Swift.
Sorry to say it, but this course is really bad.
Not very informative content, some parts are interesting but not worth the money.
The worst thing is, all assignments are writting work that are evaluated by colleagues, meaning, it is purely objective, to the extent that one question asks if my uploaded file is in a readable format, example pdf, txt...
etc and two out of three marking my pdf file as not!!!
The assignments are relatively hard in that you don't get all the necessary info from the course, sometimes even R's own manpages aren't enough.
Moreover, their sentences are so long and complicated that makes it impossible to get it.
This course is supposed to be part of specialization.
I think this course should be named basic iOS programming.
The course doesn't provide professional UI design, just teach some basic which Human Interface guideline has.
Also the instructor doesn't seem iOS expertise.
As a person with a disability I find it highly offensive when people speak like they're doing the person with whatever kind of disability a favor for even helping them.
Very superficial and inconclusive.
The course professor focuses more on himself than on the material.
In my opinion it cannot be the purpose to make your student google basic things that could easily be integrated into the course.
Considering that this is labelled as a beginner course I was expecting much more theoretical input.
Very frustrating to decipher the lazily worded questions.
I've come to the conclusion that it's unforgivable to teach it using graphlab (that you have to pay for after free licence expiry) when everyone else teaches scikit learn (sklearn) for good reason.
The tools used on this course are also not very good.
Everyone else teaches using text editors - for a good reason, you learn how to code properly.
The lessons are also dry and there are far too many of them.
Hand written derivations impose a natural pace and focal point to the content.
This should not be a course in itself
Other schools like Gnomon WorkShop and DVDs like "Eat3D" and many others out there, which gives e more content for a fraction of the price they charging here!
I am confused.
Just close the free enroll already, make ppl life easy.
And finally, this course is advertised as requiring 3-5 hours per week.
really it's not just the certificate .
Thank you Coursera for this huge chance.
The instructor's command of the English language is awful and the sub-titles are some help, but not a lot.
Very bad or non-existent support
I'll say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization, if you have the skills to complete this course then you don't need to take this course.
I'm very disappointed.
There also wasn't a good grader provided.
i hope to learn more how you wrote the code in class.
After 8 weeks of Arduino-related courses I've got almost nothing new besides first 2 chapters of Arduino Starter Kit book.
The course description should clearly state that JavaScript will be taught and that it will be used to draw boxes of different colors.
The class recording could have been made simple.
The quizzes in the course are beyond impossible.
It felt like amateur course.
I guess this isn't a course for beginners.
Just a number of boring videos of what you may possibly learn in Data Science Specialization.
It would have been worth more buying good literature on algorithms.
Desapointing.4..
The only new term to me is the high-road vs. low-road, the rest is the common sense to me.
Very basic.
And I'm sure they are very nice people who really want others to learn.
Just wonder how Coursera allows such courses to be places on the platform.
This course doesn't contain any new information.
Assingments seem to be dessinged by someone very lazy.
Way to basics, just to much explication but nothing actually to implement or to do.
That is the same principle how cults work.
Maybe their goal, stopping polluting and changing the world in such a speed seems to be a good one.
!The people who just want to learn for free and not purchase a certificate are barred from attempting the quizzes unlike the old platform.
Probably this is not the course I was looking for when I joined it.
The videos are fine.
The programming assignments require knowledge that isn't presented in the course.
I'm sorely disappointed.
Course contained unbelievable amount of silly busywork that has no place being implemented in MATLAB, while forbidding the use of most useful built in functions.
It's way too little for a capstone project course.
Staff does not care about learners's concerns.
I think this info completely useless here and must be part of any specialized networking course.
Now, I am in the third course and the SAME thing is happening!
The course has a fundamental problem, it relies completely on a library developed by one of the instructors, which is not open source.
Fix this and you'll have 4 or 5 stars easy.
Still, the videos sometimes contain useful information.
satisfactory
Or the problem, the twist, the resolution, rising action, denouement, fine action, etc."
-_-
Its nice to see the instructors speak and work through examples.
That's everything but good style (for software as well as for learning).- Code snippets can't be tested individually.
As a career dieter who is constantly reading about causes of obesity, I can't say I learned anything too earth-shattering.
The material is presented in such a way that it neither suits the mathematically inclined nor those interested a more hands-on introduction to neural networks.
Strategy is much, much wider term.
Staff participation in my run of the course (2016) was disappointingly low; in some cases there was no response at all to students pointing out glaring errors in the lectures.
It's very noticeable that this course is a patchwork of previous courses.
I can't get the picture of this field clearly.
The assignment looks nice.
they do exactly this and you got the point and if you got the point, the formular wasn't such a big thing anymore.
However much of these questions were not covered in the lectures or the required and optional reading.
Interesting things about graph algos, but I think the content should be more challengingEspecially the last two weeks, a quick quizz and a free assignment the automatically give full grade whatever the content
Not as interesting as they could have been.
The 21st century at the University of Virginia must look quite different from the 21st century where I am.
Not as advanced as other Coursera courses, this course if for participants who do not have any background in international relations and diplomacy.
One more try and i would have had it.
Honestly I cannot believe that this course won't allow people to go an extra mile to make something better and learn more than what course was designed for.
I learned a little bit, and as such found the course worth the time I put into it, but I almost think one could get through this course with little difficulty without reading any of the written materials, and thus derive very little benefit from it.
True or false".
Lectures of later weeks were "rushed", very little buildup of understanding and I felt assignments were done for the sake of passing, very little were learned during those final 3 to 4 weeks.
I will not financially support any University that allows it's faculty to express inappropriate personal ideology in a classroom setting.
I do not recommend this course, or any course with Professor Susan Rodger.
The course is interesting and might be useful for complete strangers in the world of fitness/physical activity, as it provides some general ideas about implementing activity to one's daily life, as well as gives a good understanding on stating achievable goals.
Help on topics is very limited.
However, it is a complete disappointment.
In every single assignment, it requires a file, which is built by going through every single lectures of the course.
No practical learning, use case basis discussion.
Should have focused on one of the aspects to make it more stronger.
Between these two issues, I am not having a good experience with this course.
You will spend a lot of time searching the internet to compelte the assignments.
Some times at the code practice it is not understandable how to solve the problem.
Not a bad introduction, but if you already know a bit about programming you can get the same basics and learn more quickly with a book.
I would not really recommend.
A pairwise comparison process may be useful when doing this.
Very basic course with an extremely limited view on what makes a good plot.
You could have done that, kind of a waste of time for those other people.
frankly so far this is the best in Career Success but still not well presented
For example, in week 3 we are asked to create data frames from input files: these are presented in descending order of complexity for cleanup.
Social Media Marketing is such a fun + interesting subject that I could not BELIEVE they could make it so dull.
Videos mostly show lecturers talking to camera.
I think it would have been more enjoyable with useful examples and practice.
Ok, the course is still worth doing, but i think there is much room for creating a smooth and enjoyable learning process.
Almost none.
(-2)It seems to me that the course is very difficult to complete without additional sources.
Teaching from this perspective would likely make the concepts much easier to grasp and importantly, RETAIN.
Requires at least intermediate knowledge of Python; especially the programming assignments are barely doable without advanced debugging skills.
Teacher has difficulties speaking English and is really distracting that has bad audio in some of the lessons.
I actually am an Excel beginner, and have merely an average grasp of mathematics.
It should be less lectures and information for one week.
Because this format diluted the intensity and possibility of the course, making it drag and bore towards the end.
Undoubtedly the course instructor is very knowledgeable.
I have been able to complete the hole course on one free day.
While it's clear that a lot of time was spent filming and creating the course material, I still would not recommend this course.
Slow and redundant.
No real meat on these bones.
I give 2 stars becuase the concepts of the assignments is good, but the course needs more attention.
In particular, telling students to look for the board of editors in a journal and adapt your results and how you express things accordingly, it is in my opinion a bit unethical.
My only BIGGEST disappointment is that the essays were evaluated by students like me.
Incorrect terminology (Ah-ah?
The TAs were a critical learning component before especially considering that unlike on EdX where course staff actually participates in the forums, on Coursera I do not think I have ever observed course staff actively participating in the forums.
It was too simple for my taste and not very fullfilling science wise
They quote facts and names and rarely bother to elaborate on them.
If you already know C, a lot of the content is a waste of time, but I imagine that if you don't know C this is not a good way to pick it up.
So overall 2/5One other thing - the assignments are graded in a pretty bizarre way.
This strikes me as bad pedagogy.
In order to answer the questions and prepare the requested page of html tags, it became necessary for a beginner such as me to research elsewhere in order to answer the questions.
you need to explain the new terms which you use in the lectures and the lectures should be elaborate and should stress more on the basic things like abcdefg here you need to explain a in detail b in detail c in detail so on then after in the next lectures you can move fastly.
Not satisfied.
Afterwards they do an everyday life example.
The video lectures are confusing and quizzes too
(-1)
Very poor CSS content
The real course comes from the reading and peer discussions.
Or both.
The class is getting stale.
The content is too basic, and both lectures are too boring.
But, still, it is a shame to split one month course to 4.
I think it is really necessary to establish better the target auditory for this course.
Not what I signed up (and paid) for.
So it’s a pity and I do regret having had to stop attending this online class.
I'm sorry but I don't like the way this course was presented.
I am kind of disappointed that you have to pay for the course before you can submit the solution to the problem set.
I thought the aerial course was much better.
you can take the assignments only if you pay
txt) document descriptions needs to be more clearer.
This course is somewhat lacking depth.
Minus 3 stars for 3 complaints1.
If you want to use synths and effects and noise things and such to create EDM music ... well, this isn't the course for you either, but maybe it would be more beneficial to you than most other categories.
So, who is this course for?
Not enough materials in the video.
I would not recommend this course .
You can pass this course without watching a single lecture and that's a travesty to Michigan State.
It is full of typos and oversights that could have been avoided if they had once person run through the course as a quality control.
Muy light
They should replace these quizzes with project, where you write real code.
However I did not take away as much from this course as I would like to.
The splicing of the videos is bad, and for me actual video of how t
Many a times, the mathematical equations looked daunting.
I enrolled in the Business Analytics Specialization course with a focus on analyzing a business from the inside, not outside.
I would say that this course is the most difficult among this specialization (practical machine learning is much easier than this).
It seems I have failed at week three without having to ask for the answers for three questions.
not good enough!
This is less of a university level course and more of a long infomercial for Michael Pollen books with a cooking show at the end.
There is no interviews with nutritionists or scientists.
Some live example or a case study to be incorporated where the students can apply the principles first hand.
I would advise having a professor from Illinois who is not in the business school take this course and get their feedback.
Not much clear what is required to solve the problem.
The author also does a lot of self-promotion with regards to his company, his research studies, and his book.
The only positive to this class is that it progresses quickly, making the lack of quality more tolerable.
The lectures are not well organized.
This is far off the standard set by courses 1 and 2.
There's a tiny bit of that discussed with microphone placement and the like, but it quickly moves to digital sound creation.
few specifics and examples
It did include a good amount of interesting material around different systems, but there were a couple of key things that made me lose interest in the course at around week 6 out of 11.
First, I felt that the instructor talks about how he wants people to learn to think for themselves, yet I also felt that he himself preaches.
while the task of summing up a lot of information in a minimum sized presentation is always a very difficult task, the structure of the material presented was not optimal.
What companies need to do today?
Assignments mostly copy and paste.
I am not happy with how we're often only required to submit a single number as an answer.
Too simple, no programming, just theory.
Regarding new tendencies...
Maybe this is a good course for somebody who has no background in finance.
Not in depth enough
Week 1 a little disapointing
Seems like the course lectures are out of order or duplicated.
And I understand some situations are complex with a lot of variables, but it seems as though a lot of "environmental proponents" just talk about stuff and don't give examples of what they are doing to change the world.
The stickied posts in the forums offer a bit of help with the assignments (not enough, but still something).
Update info in videos and course would have value.
Technical portions are marked by a number of errors in speaking and on the slides, as well as a lot of hesitation and jargon.
I think with more listen exercises this course will be better and the length of the videos too short.
I think this course could be much better without Jack Wu, laughing every few seconds.
The framework is ok, but it would be more insight on the functions would be much more amplifying the learning process.
Good working examples, though!
I was really interested in this course and I think the information is useful.
Nowhere near as useful as the first two courses.
And I'm saying that as someone who already had quite some ideas for one game and even started experimental programming.
Probably ok for people with no knowledge at all in IT or Finance
I think the course, while well laid out content-wise, is poorly executed.
Lecture videos were fantastic!
This parameter is not realy existed in this function now
Key focus areas on Spark and MongoDB are not given enough focus and lab time.
The quizes have badly worded questions.
She seems to think we already know how to do things like imply a characters state of mind through action.
not very explanatory
There wasn't a lot of information inside the video and the test's questions hade multiple possible answer.
However, the links to ressources such as HarvardReview or Inc.
com were pretty good and usefull.
I will enrol in more advanced courses.
Could not get through the first week.
good course, but the way it is required to be done sucks
However, the specialization up to this point does not equip student with the skills beyond the basics.
the content of the course seemed good but instructors play a huge role on delivering those content to the students so it just didn't work for me.
To be fair, not all of this is the task statement, there is a lot of test code as well, but you know.. even one third of 53 is an impressive volume for a 4 weeks course (you get re-enrolled if you fail to be fair).
Nice introduction but actually very little content
Too simple and boring
Exercises often refer to material not covered in the course up to that point.
I was hoping to lean more on metrics especially in the digital marketing section.
It's a bummer that we aren't moving in a different direction with this stuff after so long, but I guess it's still what people expect (or at least have learned to cope with).
The transcripts also help in reviewing the contents of each lesson.
On the minus side:1) It is very theoretical and with no practical application.2) Lots of terminology pops out of the blue without any prior explanation, and would be difficult to understand for a total newbie.
We trained k-means on pre-computed features which happened to come from from a deep learning network (not sure which one, inception?
Nothing really new.
Kindly do the needful to change it.
I would recommend skipping this module and moving directly to the R Programming course.
See -- now you can play!Thinking of learning algebra?
1 out of 10.
A waste of time.
However, I thought the quizzes were poorly written.
In short, they are misleading and confusing you on a topic you are trying to learn.
This is of course unintentional but gives you a clue about how the quality check on lecture videos are taken care of.
You see several video with animated presentation and typical (vocabulary) terms.
It is not for beginners because in course you didn't find answers.
It is not for pros because in course you didn't find interesting material.
Hope that instructors can change course to better.
Very shallow overview, not really a full course I'd say.
"Because of degrees of freedom" Only mention, no further explanation.
I was interested by the syllabus and its outline of theories and the means to use models to study social sciences and systems sciences.
Being a developer who has used some of the tools in this toolbox (Git, GitHub, Command Line) this intro really glosses over tools that most non developers won't understand.
Come on, we are here learning the concepts of developments digital games and the instructor says that we can make a non digital prototype?
The questions of this type are pointless.
I would have learnt a lot more through a course had they been more defined assignments.
Not a course if you are looking to be ready for data related interviews.
But there was no details about how to use JavaScript for web programming.
)From a 40+ year software engineer, with doctorate in CS, a part-time instructor at a private university, with a very challenging technology job in a multi-national corporation.
not so much live examples full of theories.
this has been thought in class it self.
seemed like a filler, nit are why this was included
For those who have the essential knowledge of all that, the course would be a repetition of the basics.
He did not attempt to teach the students in these videos.
Quizzes are excessively easy.
They both agree that the result is weird but then continue to explain that this is how Swift works.
It is not a real class, it is a video and it could be done much more accurately.
There are too many poured notions without practical explanations or case studies.
Especially for me as a non-native foreign english speaker it is very hard to follow.
Update:Coursera or the course content provider has changed this course in a bad way: You have to PAY for the course IN FULL AMOUNT JUST to get your assignments submitted and reviewed by peer learner.
What a pity.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great course!
I did learn a few helpful tips for analyzing data with excel - particularly how to do a regression analysis in excel which is something I didn't know and is not intuitive.
For those interested in taking exams, these questions were poorly worded and it was evident that the person writing the questions in English was not proficient in the English Language.
I really enjoyed the first two weeks.
Primarily focused on US politics and the US policy system.
Week 3 spends 3 long lectures how to build a discrete simulation application and exercises are about property checking.
In other words, most students responded to how cool or interesting they found my assignments, without regard for the weekly lecture or the grading criteria.
I do hope someone will go through this course and fix the inconsistencies and technical errors.
Here is some pseudocode", with no "think about a problem that can be solved with the same ideas", like the other courses in the specialization (which are, in my opinion, much better).-We saw 4 algorithms for string matching (KMP, Rabin-Karp, suffix array matching, Burrow-Wheeler's transform), but virtually no discussion on when to use each one, strengths and weaknesses, and so on.
Otherwise, it's basically information I'd expect to be relayed to kindergarteners.
I was attracted to the topic, I enjoyed the personality of the host, but all the above made it a chore.
It is left to other students to grade it and that may or may not show up to be graded by other students.
Readings in general are OK but too simple.
I have learnt many things but
The huge amout of time is wasted again on very simple dataframe APIs including several slides presenting the show() function.
The few text headers which appeared then disappeared in only a very few seconds and sometimes did not relate directly to what he was saying at that time.
Dr Germano's content: the amended title was Tibetan Buddhist Meditation.
The content of the course is ok.
That's a shame, because the editing quality of the videos is excellent, the use of git and rspec is likewise commendable.
Even worse, it's not entirely clear who the target audience is.
That being said, the lectures were absolutely useless.
I believe this was the first offering of this course, and I hope as it offered again those discrepancies are fixed, and perhaps more official teaching staff are able to monitor the forums.
As far as the material itself, it is pretty good, and covers most of the basics well.
In most instances it is hard to predict where the instructor is writing and is hard to read.
I have a big problem with the final project in Week 5.
Similar issues abound around the course.
In fact, for many of the good ones, visuals take a secondary role to the actual written content.
I don't feel like I learned a whole lot, there wasn't a lot of new information presented.
In my opinion, the forums are one of the great features in the Coursera which could really helps student to learn the content better.
Sincerely,Omid
Course content is good, however, material is explained fairly quickly and the lady who is lecturing is almost impossible to understand (due to a very strong accent and a very mechanical reading), which made me want to skip all her lectures.
That said, Professor Nalebuff has a very engaging teaching style and presents each lecture in a dynamic fashion via animation.
This course does not say anything about digitization which is the core subject of the digital wave.
The two are in no way synonymous.
I scored it as I did because I think the course title should have Lightroom & Pixlr in there since weeks 3 & 4 dominate those two.
Should go into more depth - esp with Visual Design.
The instructor writes and talks simultaneously.
I'm not sure how a professor could possibly mix up the two, but he did.
The only reason I'm not giving it 1 star is that there was, in fact, some interesting info about responsive web design.
There is a lot of good information in here that is told poorly.
Small introduction.
Should have been at least twice as long to give more depth.
I took onus with a number of ideas/concepts offered, simply because they are either misrepresentative of SM or untrue.
The course involved many interesting conceptions (like how modern conceptions of civil society differ from Hegel’s) and discussions of many really worthy persons (like Pablo Casals, Bronisław Huberman, or Ai Weiwei) but did not pertain music as such.
If I had been able to study an extra 10 hours a week practicing using the formulas then I'm sure I would have got more out of it.
I don't usually review but this was not great, the reading material they linked to was the best content overall.
Some videos / slides are great and full of information, while others are just long periods of talking with one word or phrase on the screen and none of the information put in written form.
Some of the questions occur in multiple practice quizzes.
"How is this going to allow the students to learn more if they are going to be graded badly if they do?
=(
Honestly, I barely listened to the teacher's videos.
In other courses of that specialization track you even need to pay to do peer assessments.
But they are very messy and badly formatted, matching the messy handwriting in the videos.
Why should we pay for a specialization preview, we can read info about the separate courses on our own?
The following classes from this specialization are from the same teacher, so I don't think things will improve much.
Very much theoretical.
I will continue to try to learn calculus, but this didn't work for me.
Not this long.
This course is not a beginner level course rather it is an intermediate one.
Overall a good course .
)The only positive aspect of this course is the challenge to work with defined datasets, to complete specific tasks, during week 3.
The first course I was really dissappointed with.
Fairly poor level of detail - you feel like you end up just learning terms without really getting a proper test on the understanding behind it.
I do like the course, but Coursera has disabled discussion forums for this course, which makes it impossible for the students to interact and find answers to problems or discuss possible errors in the example code.
Contents are good and interesting, but speakers' english is so low and bad (pronunciation) that the course becomes almost unpleasant.
They were cursorily dealt with.
Did not go into enough detail, reiterated home cooking and spoil rate but did not get into specifics.
Rarely did it include "how and why" to use that XYZ for musicality.
The quizzes were awful as well.
The first module was a very, very basic outline of a generic analysis process, and really has nothing to do with digital marketing analytics in particular.
Unfortunately the one example (jerk trajectory) provided appears to have left a lot of students feeling very unsupported based on feedback I saw, and would probably benefit from having an example more fully worked through.
I hope this Microdegree will get into some kind of complexity otherwise will remain high school level.
While I fully agree with the premise of the course, the importance of leadership communication through storytelling, this course presented no sources, psychological research, or evidence to defend its arguments.
I don't have the impression that much effort was invested in this class to present natural language processing as introductory as possible for beginners in this field, i.
e.
If you have a lot of time you don't know how to spend.
This course does not do a good job at teaching the material.
I'm sorry, but I felt the week 4 assignment materials is not consistent to lesson videos or the lesson video does not explained enough.
I think that making students think does not mean making explanation indistinct.
This makes it tough to learn.
The assignment was also really similar to the
I would have appreciated if the video lessons were focusing more on commenting case studies; in many cases I had the impression that the Professor was simply reading the slides...
I lost interest in the course because it was more about seeing some one else as a leader than myself.
There is a lot of research into the course yet it is too theoretical & not put in precise & interesting manner.
Some lessons are too simple.
The course content was good but teaching method was too poor to understand.
A really hard class for anyone not graduated from collage.
I expected same amount of teaching like homework, but it's more like 30 minutes versus 7 hours every week.
The grader is horrible leaving you with such brief error messages.
Since this is about the science of happiness I would have preferred a more clinical approach.
Asked for guidance from staff.
I did not expected such poor course from a paid one; I have doen free courses way better than this course.
Also, very boring.
I don't have anything against ads, but ads are not very suitable for teaching.
Simply not as engrossing as I had hoped it would be.
Hence, it get complicated to follow the course.
There can be some external readings suggested - resources that help us get more understanding on the subjects discussed.
The content was good though!
Some parts of material is good quality, but some is bad - also some show bad practices in R. Extensively use swirl as assignments over self work.
Too basic!
Would have been helpful to include Python 3 syntax for all programs.
Most of the lectures were very rushed and brief.
However, I learnt much more from swirl rather than from the instructor.
I was expecting something more in-depth.
Though, the forum is very useful.
But at the end it failed to do justice all4.
It seems that nobody proof read his lectures before posting it on coursera.
Instead, the quizes are full of questions like "Present Simple tense is used to write about a special study implemented by a well-known scientist.
Very shallow
I would even go so far as to say that the approach is unscientific: no definitions, derivations, examples.
There should be a little bit more handholding in order for the student to learn the concepts.
The course is too shallow - amount of topics discusses is quite small.
It should be avoided.
Overall - in my opinion, to be relevant in the online you have to upscale your game.
I understand that students are expected to do independent learning of material, but the gulf between lectures and test difficulty was extreme.
For one, the intensity, rigour and to-the-pointedness of the content sharply fell after the first week.
I guess that real UAVs engineers are not paid for this.
Assignments can be done only in the paid version, but as it's so basic and everything is peer graded for me the course isn't worth the money (compared to other paid language learning classes online or in-person).
However, some of the code was outdated and didn't work properly.
75% of the course is amazing, the rest needs some work.
I worked hard to do my assignment on time, then I had to switch sessions because no one was assessing my work.
Its good for the starters but touches very few and very basic concepts.
(!!)
I think it would be better to leave the mathematics and application learning to supporting materials and focus on explaining the theory and concepts of statistical inference in the lectures.
The lectures were basically video workshops with a few gems of knowledge here and there.
The caliber of questions in the quizzes is quite advanced.
But the quality has really disappointed :( A huge amount of misprints in printable exercises, a few grammar mistakes in the answers, mistakes in the execution of the online exercises.
I believe it is quite complicate for me to understand, esspecial git and github.
I know project management is not that boring.
This course dedicates an entire week to very simple topics.
This coarse don't worth 80 bucks at all
Prof Covach did nothing to stimulate discussion in the forums and although I posted a few things there was very little going on in the forums.
I learned some things that I didn't know from this class.
The policy here bring huge inconvenience for people like me.
Hard to follow for non-native speakers.
As someone who has taken Coursera offerings in the past, I cannot cosign the quality of this course.
This class seems to suffer from both a lack of structure and time.
Do not mention lectures not in the course.
Needs homework problems guided by videos like Statistical Inference coarse to make easier.
The course is more of a 'caret' package review then actual Machine Learning.
The quality of the course material is really poor and disappointing.
I base my ratings of courses on 3 things:1) Is the material clear?
The course is not very insightful and on the surface.
I did not like the teacher but I did like the course material.
a bit basic
While well organized and structured, it only provides the student with the minimum basics of the IoT and embedded systems concepts.
No material to read, Javascript is way more than just 10 hours.
It could be a bit more challenging than just running scripts.
I feel ripped off and I sincerely hope that the next section is better otherwise I doubt I will bother to continue until the end.
They give R code for everything.
The slides that you could download are sometimes cutoff, leaving information out.
I know in each week forum, there is one discussion specifically for assignment (i.
e.
Since there are not many students in this course one might feel a bit "left alone".
Week 2 quiz I had to take multiple times and really couldn't figure out what the correct answer was.
In my opinion, quality MOOC's either singular courses, either specializations have to be very well balanced in content - both in quality and quantity.
Search in a 12-dimensional parametric space (some parameters are equal, but still you end up tunning 5,6 independent parameters, which influence each other).
Slides summing up concepts or used functions will be great.
I also thought the tests were vaguely worded and the final assignment was long and definitely more than the 30 minutes it said it would take to complete it.
I would recommend http://ielanguages.
com/linguistics/ for a more detailed and more concise introduction.
There is some good foundation for a course in here, but it just falls apart in the third week and lacks any real depth.
Each lesson is not clearly defined and he rambles on about aspects, which though interesting, have little or no bearing on the course objective.
As well, many of the answers to the questions on the exams are not given in the lecture nor in the badly designed slides.
but maybe I wasn't the right student for the class.
Several courses have been combined.
Sadly, all the doing is clumped into the assignments (more on them later).
You don't exactly learn a lot about the techniques just how to use them and name them out if you're having a conversation with a person.
While the first week touched on Excel and the equations can be used in Excel and have efficacy in regards to analyzing data, it feels as if the course emphasizes more on utilizing math than utilizing Excel.
There is not enough depth in the course.
She often does not put her bullet points or lists on the slides ( I am a visual learner and she does not provide enough on screen info) She is really uncomfortable and makes it really hard to listen to her talk.
The weeks 1 and 2 are really good!!!!
I think already high school students can figure out the tips by themselves.
Not for beginners.
As usual - Graphlab Create sometimes crashes, however there are explanations how to run the assignments using Scikit-Learn.
The lectures for this course seem unorganized and often had poor audio.
I still learnt a couple of cool metrics I didn't know about, but the course didn't bring any added value to the blog links provided.
Half of lectures time is talking about nothing and it seems that there were no lecture plan before shooting the video.
There's a bit of a tour of XCode, but it's not particularly comprehensive.
The only major drawback is the requirement of Graphlab, which doesnt allow the student to fully understand the applications using real world software.
Couldn't even get an official response about the apparent removal of Distinction-level now (which I'd been working to get in all specialization courses and now seems no longer an option).
Google+ wasn't relevant five years ago, let alone in 2016.
This course content definitely needs update.
Very, very high altitude introduction presented in a seemingly confused way with a lot of product placement.
Discusses mostly the problems with the US system of governance and it therefore not really useful for international viewers.
I'm working on the assignment now and feel like we barely scraped the surface with both of these programs.
There are just too many tools being introduced in this MOOC, and not enough practical learning.
The assignments are incredibly simple, and I think that there should be no optional assignments in the class.
Just as a very simple example, backlinks are mentioned several times.
questions such as:Who are the main visitors?
It makes it frustrating to jump into the exercises when the course had 5-7 minutes of lectures, 15 minutes on the exercise and then an assignment on something new.
Update: I'm also impressed by Mr. Muppala taking feedback like a boss and blaming students for low reviews.
The professors did no prepared the classes.
Having watch the first week's videos, I found that the professor mostly just read the slides - and did it in a very faithful and careful manner, not to miss a subscript ....
Think twice before buying.
Having coding assignments weekly would have been very helpful.
The final assignment in the module was unclear to me and the feedback unkind.
This course doesn't help much
Lectures seem a bit generic and although Liz Gerber tries to make it hands on, the subject matter really doesnt seem anywhere as tangible as when Klemmer presents it.
While the efforts of the coursemakers are greatly appreciated, much could be done to refine the quality of the course.
Some aspects are presented at a very high level, yet using very specialised terminology and concepts.
Course is too slow to keep focus, it's repetitive but not clear when it's really needed.
i feel that the course need more explanation .. i got really lost in the begging of the HW
The course name is very misleading.
Too short and easy.
The quiz are often not well related to the lecture and the assignments are badly explained and there's no much documentation related to them.
I would like to have done some exercises.
No slides or writen support to guide the student.
Course was not easy to grasp, lost interest after the first week and I barely got through the quiz at the end.
This course can only be taken who have good knowledge in programming.
Although there is a assessment quiz at the start of the course It needs to kept in mind that since this course is part of specialization,most people would take it and not all of them are programmers.
This course needs a revamp to suit all sorts of security enthusiasts.
Very bad description of the problem, it made me really suffer.
This course doesn't do this.
The course contents are covered too briefly to learn anything useful.
Lacks of structure.
References multiple tools/programs "that we won't detail in this course" (... why are they talked about then ?
Of the 4 weeks of the course, I'd say that only week 4 was valid from an internal perspective but it was kept very high level.
The ability to interface with Excel after some knowledge of Python/R or other programming languages would be helpful in the Data Science programming that is increasingly being promoted.
The course needs some serious rethinking and refactoring.
Good video lectures, pointless assignments .
This breaks the flow of the lectures and makes a lot of unuseful repetitions.
The slides only have words and are hard to follow, no graphs or illustrations, this means that you rely on the voice of the lecturer to guide you, which is difficult sometimes.
Furthermore, the code presented is not run 'live', and results are often lacking, which makes comparison with 'my own results' hard to do.
Summary: Not that its a bad course (SWIRL is a great tool), just look for another course that's easier to follow.
I would have preferred to just take a look at some proven case studies linked to the tools.
Appears more like a revision for those who already know the content than geared towards those new to the subject.
It is advertised as a class for beginners, but I have found it beyond frustrating, and whats more I pre-paid for the specialization so this Excel class and the final project seem to be an utter waste of money without me going off to study Excel at length before trying the course again.
The rest was too confusing, with lots of lists and no explanations.
If you have the patience for this, or are used to this style of learning, go ahead.
If you want to learn Java, this course is not for you.
The course mainly solves image manipulation problems with Duke's proprietary JavaScript IDE.
Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.
There's some potential in this course but it desperately needs to be updated for 2017.
My suggestion to the instructors would be less questions on the quizzes and more relevant to what you teach.
The lectures and assignments questions are more about the history of the internet and HTML.
I've finished my specialization in "Python for Everyone" and thought this specialization would be a nice follow on.
This course is really hard, and I am having ALOT trouble understanding it.
The course is abandoned.
I didnt find the tests great
I am now retired, but even when I worked that was never an option.
Just awful, and makes it really hard to follow and stay interested and connected with the topic (even when you're passionate about the subject).
I would rather have the course in Italian, and read the subtitles, if that means a more energetic delivery.
Most of those information you can find in every web-page on time management.
This course is a disappointment after the previous two courses in the specialisation.
The videos could have some diagram.
As they are echos on the background and need to set to high volume to heard the speaker.
Love Coursera but was disappointed in this course.
The video for Week 2, Lesson 2, for example, had a single static image on the screen for eleven minutes.
This is a complex course for people who don't know R Studio.
Perhaps this should be a topic/chapter in another course, and not a standalone course.
So, set them to task, sorting pile after pile.
The second part is on JavaScript.
Useful to note the not so realistic 3 peer-reviews awaited in that course... Two of 1000 words and one of 350-550 words!
Such a structure of explanations doesn't give freedom in the future to do something different, as you don't get a general understanding of what you do.
Additionally, all course is tought in Mac.
For example, there were 5 important tips and only one was given, before jumping at next topic.
There was too much focus on high-level details of the course project and too little attention paid to technical details.
I think some ideas are not applied to every field.
I recommend "The Big Fat Surprise" and "Good Calories, Bad Calories" as an alternate view of healthy living.
Unfortunately I found this course to be the least enjoyable so far in the specialization.
Some things that were pretty easy to understand, were explained over 10 very boring minutes, other things that were far more complex and tricky, were handled in half a minute.
Also, the assignments were a bit of a leap from the video tutorials at times.
Sometimes to the point of being useless or even worse - saying the exact of opposite of what the lecturer says.
I could see that happening to me) and probably made the course more entertaining, but didn't do it for me.
Also consider Hugo Larochelle's videos.
What I mean, is that I feel that we were told a lot about how things are, and very little about what to do.
But that doesn't say anything against the course.
The content is very relevant to the subject matter.
Very basic, it's like reading the table of contents of a guidebook 'How to become an Entrepreneur'.
Class content would better serve the students as a searchable PDF.
Thanks for the course.
way to much emphasis on non-data science.
None of us are going to calculate things to such an extent....
I am very interested in this topic however I found the instructor's presentation to be so monotonic and slow paced that I dropped out.
Grading must be done by Professor.
You can expect to learn some basic syntax of Swift, and that's about it.
I am taking the Digital Marketing Specialization and this has been the poorest course I have taken thus far.
In my opinion, presenting a course that only has videos is not an effective way of learning.
Seems like a lot of this information will be lost or forgotten when it comes time to use it, especially as it relates to the Data Science Specialization.
Compared to that course, the lectures here are superficial and not very engaging.
The course is well structured and provides a good introduction, however, I expected a bit more from a course that costs 20 pounds than just a few clips on how to install and set-up software/create a github account etc.
The contents of the course are coloured with medical perspective and with pathological view point2.
This material is important, but the assessment quizzes were tedious as the right answer often hung on some small obscure remark that was hard to recall.
Alas, after only 10 minutes of the first video, I am reminded that this instructor does not gear his lectures to the true Beginners among us.
Too summarized and vague!
Finally for some reason the support from Technical Advisors was also lacking in the specific session that I did, contributing to my frustration and rather negative experience of what could be a very good course
Very easy
She is talking with us like we are small kids, and so she can keep our attention only by special voice and multiple stories her private life.
Too high level
I thought the lessons were really boring, there are some interesting aspects about it, but it's hard to concentrate, Pat Pattinson couldn't get me hooked up all the time.
This course, which sounds promising in title and syllabus, has many glaring deficiencies.
It seems that the course was rushed and not properly tested before it accepted students.
Some of the required readings also had broken links.
course needs problems with explanations and/or better feedback on quizzes.
Very little modelling in this course, instead you get some accounting lectures which are pretty difficult to follow if you have no previous accounting knowledge.
The lectures are very long, not chunked for easy viewing (to the point where I couldn't download to my phone for offline/off-wifi use).
Very superficial teachings.
Most classes are someone showing how they do something their way, rather than guiding or teaching with the intent to have the student absorb and re-apply principles.
Very difficult for a student to absorb material from this video series
The case studies are quite artificial and the answers are too obvious.
I have reviewed 7 papers (requirement of 3) and am shown as being deficient.
The same goes for the end-assignment project where much functionality was required within a short time -- and the course was delayed so many of the students could not fit it into their schedule.
I couldn'tfinish this course because it was too much the.
It's also baffling that they would spend nine weeks on public policy in the 21st century and only include one female speaker and not a single person of colour.
The course is good but very basic.
Assignments at times a bit hazy and there is very little guidance.
This type of content is what I was most interested in.
While the content (common predictive regression and classification algorithms and tools like XLMiner) was useful, little to no support was provided in the forums.
But actually it is some kind of well manners that everybody should apply in social life.
It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners, given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics, tons of time on fairly advanced topics, and almost no time on critical intermediate-level content.
This is highlighted by the fact that the weekly quizzes didn't show you the solution when you missed a question, so you were left guessing (instructors don't respond to student discussion questions) if the videos didn't address that specific question type.
This course is about "good practices" for user interface design.
The course is outdated and abandoned by the teachers.
SwiftKey engineers are nowhere to be seen.
There is no guidance.
I thought it would contain more detailed information about the subject considering is technically an online course.
The quiz questions are sometimes verbatim sentences from one book with a missing word - which I find hardly a test of acquired knowledge.
The lesson plans and project were very vague and too much time was spent trying to figure out what was even being asked.
why intro is so long?it becomes boring without any physical interpretation of knowledgecan't you take at least one design project or demomany things were said but very little went in head
Disorganized course materials.
The best section of the course was week 5, where they syntax of Objective-C and Swift were superficially compared.
Ideally, the project was more related to quantitative data, or have compulsory module NPL.
Login and uploading files IS IMPORTANT to be learned.
Very difficult.
There are no advanced stuff these what is taught are basics any graduate or undergraduate student can easily pickup on his/ her own interest.
They also offered a number of practice assignments with self grading capability which is a nice feature.
The graded programming assignment for week 2 gives a lot of information about how to set up your environment and steps/commenting to assist building out your code.
the course is a bit outdated and I am finding it hard to stay motivated knowing there are other more recent courses.
all this course justified one class at top.
No certificate on completion, which is a pity because the cost of a purchased one is somewhat prohibitive for third world students with our exchange rates.
It could have been more dynamic .
Some parts border on misinformation, does seem almost as if it's been underwritten by the DEA.
The format with a large variety of testimonials from experts in different niches of the healthcare sector was interesting.
It would probably be better if the data science track had an optional "intro to statistics" class that can take more time to let students familiarize themselves with the terminology, and then a separate "ins and outs of probability testing in R" for those already familiar.
This course seems to try and bite off more than it can chew by attempting to be both at the same time.
Still, the lectures are interesting and the material is important to learn / cover.
Perhaps unsurprising being an introductory course, but the presenters struggle when faced with setting expectations.
Throughout the course presenters often gloss over fairly complex concepts, treating them as they were trivial knowledge.
This class required far too much independent study.
And I found the current response in the FQA section of the course to this problem very unusefull and discouraging... .
I am guessing that the course is not really meant for absolute beginners and some previous knowledge of programming and such is needed.
I think this course needs to be reconfigured and taught from an applied focus instead of 30% applied 70% theory.
Also the new format is horrible and TAs are nonexistent as are discussions in general on the forums now.
The lectures were monotonous and stiff, I found myself watching the videos on mute with the subtitles on!
Also the quizzes are way too easy and you can try until you get it right.
Some of the facts about poetry aren't accurate.
)Improve the alignment between the assignment and the review criteria.
I'll probably try the second course in the series (for free to start) to see if things improve, but ironically this advertisement video has if anything turned me off their other products.
many question in the quiz wasn't covered in the video lectures.
In hindsight, I wish I hadn't paid for a verified certificate.
Videos run way to fast when someone is working between multiple windows to accomplish tasks.
Excellent video materials---one of the best classes on this subject, but there has been no support.
I would guess that anyone who actually knows the term "Internet of Things" and was able to find this course already knows all of the content presented here.
I think this course could have been more interesting.
I struggled getting any styling to work with my CSS (files that was provided by the teacher) in conjunction with my Bootstrap.
This made it hard to get the work done.
Awful typefaces, different styles, different colors.
The assignments were not clear enough.
Furthermore, doing the peer review was purely optional and the results were not actually scored.
I must appreciate Coursera for providing free courses.
The subjects are treated very superficially and the presentation style is confusing.
Not every assignment requires people's coding style to be evaluated.
It was a very interesting course, however it was biased toward Spanish history with the inclusions.
Since I am an experienced programmer, I understand the importance of coding style, creating functions and all that.
I can't recommend this course to anyone.
The course quizzes had too many questions that focused on memorizing details from the case studies or a statistic shown for a bit in the lectures rather than try to foster understanding of the material.
There were some technical issues such as links from the course readings expiring and not being replaced, in-lecture questions dealing with a subject matter different from the topic of the lecture, etc.
The one good thing from this course - it uses a great textbook (free), which provides lots and lots of useful data and insights into digital marketing - and this is the sole reason the course gets 2 stars instead of 1.
The content covered in many lectures seemed off topic.
One of the assignments when I first submitted it I got 12/20.
The professor doesn't explain clearly as part of the videos is his correcting himself or saying the same thing two or three times.
This course is for you if you like listening to someone talking through pages and pages of copy/paste text from a command prompt.
Also as this is a rather math-intensive subject, a more comprehensive review of the algebraic tools and skills required would be helpful.
Most 'instruction' in the course is centered around brief talks, or artist interviews, and thus you're often just looking at two people talking, or an artist showing you their work while they talk.
good course and well presented by both.
LIKE an advertisment!Why not use pandas and numpy sk-learn?Open source is more popular!
What states do x y or z.
However, it would be much more interesting to discuss failures and/or duller companies.
Finally, the final peer-review exercise is a bit broken but that is the case of every MOOC peer-graded approach (cf.
This class is only useful to students who are interested in an area of game design besides writing and who are taking the whole series anyway.
I feel that pricing of this Specialization is purely due to the brand name of Wharton.
When the revised slide was presented to the viewer, a word from a previous version was in the middle of the sentence.
Too many errors in the graded assignments.
I also finished the machine learning course.
This course is just definitions... and the next one as well.
I expected more detailed examples of worldbuilding, but talks were quite vague and unspecific.
To fast pace and missing lot of content to make this lesson enjoyable!!
That is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments (though still very challenging).
For the same amount of knowledge, I could have done just 3 WELL DONE courses.3) Most of courses are just things people read in front of a screen, without any passion or interest.
Some commands are different for windows, and they were not even mentioned in the videos!
Week 4 seems to have disproportionately more material than previous weeks, as though authors tried to Although free, this is course is also offered as a part of paid specialization, and I would be really disappointed if I'd spent money on a course like this.
Furthermore, I think several topics is missing which I believed the course would cover like GLP Tox, CMC, IND filing and the topics which are covered should be covered in more depth.
Short class.
Well structured in terms of content and the basic framework.
This is really bad structured.
The supplementary material is very good in that regard, compared to the lectures.
But I think the creators of this course need to be a lot clearer about what their aims are in that part of the course which Dr Germano presented.
But what is very questionable is the architecture of the quizzes.
Furthermore, the staff isn't responding AT ALL to the —many—requests of the students regarding errors in the questionaries, deadline explanations, etc.
The course starts very promising, but it gets worse week after week, culminating on a barely understandable week about dynamic programming.
This course feels quite weak, especially for the paid course, for these reasons:Models (Leader as Mentor, Coach, etc..., CTFAR model), which are given in this course, are given as is, with no references on how they were developed, authorship, and how good the results of application are.
Almost no (just one) external references for reading to better understanding course material.
The amount of material (about 3 hours of video, 4 quizzes, 2 discussions and 1 assignment) doesn't feel like it's a month's course, more like a one/one-and-a-half week.
No references on topics, described as "hard" during the course (for example, identifying your values), which would make this topics less "hard".
No instructor interaction on the course forum (I don't know if this should be like this or not, but it still feels bad).
However, the final assignment is good and practice oriented.
The course is highly theoretical.
Would have preferred a faster-paced and more substantive course.
Quizzes are fairly easy to pass provided you have some programming experience.
It is too much abstract and, in some aspects, very obvious.
One would learn a thing or two, but the course is very sparse compared to other machine learning courses, and I didn't feel that it was worth the time and the cost.
There should be a real test.
The quiz does not actually test the understanding of the topic in-depth.
Week 4 was particularly tough to get through.
In the case of this course and the professor, they failed miserably.
However, like the excel course in this specialization, most of the material isn't about using Tableau.
Quizzes could include some more questions, too.
Please include links or entire documents.
(this could be given one extra lecture in each course).
An interesting documentary but I wouldn't call this a university course.
The material in this course is well presented, though scarce at times.
Very unprofessional, compared to other courses.
Hard getting through this course.
Yes, it mentioned "alternative" approach (which is much more popular than GraphLab), but there are many bugs & trivial difficulties to get it through.
too simple, seems like a introduction for MBA class
Another proof of week 3 issue: the related swirl exercises start in week2 (2 of them) and finish in week4 (2 more exercises) !!!!
Nope, he just has it all premade for you.
The best part of the course are the additional resources lists.
More woman means less men and that is sexist.
It is more likely a microscopic level of mos description.
It's definitely to short to grasp the basics of JavaScript.
Wagner-Pyser, Glass-Steagall were gutted by the end of the century and as for the UN we all know how in ineffective that has been at protecting human rights.
This course was heavy on data and light on implications and course corrections.
More challenging questions expected.
That said, I did find this course useful, although I often felt somewhat frustrated.
The course videos are sometimes kind of less engaging.
There is a choice in assignments, you can do them either written or video.
Gaps in the materials.
I essentially had to clear my entire week's plans to complete the first week's assignment, which was by far the toughest.
overall: some weeks were fun, some notin some weeks are too many chapters and exercises.
Mapping of software product manager to scrum master is IMHO not correct.
But definitely not for beginners.
The swirl assignments were the only saving grace for a class that was otherwise not engaging or structured well.
Definitions would be helpful for someone just starting out, even if the Instructor doesn't strictly want us to abide by them.
It's here where the issue relays, the excel files are filled and instead of learning by doing you have to figure out how the prof made the file.
My husbend is a programmer with 10 years experience and when he watched the lecture he said, that even for him it was difficult to understand all the thing (things he actually knows).
More significantly, its not wholly clear to me why some of the processes were conducted, or what, explicitly, could be gleaned from the analyses.
get new material - new videos these videos for all your classes are years old - the quizes dont relate to the material taught and it seems you guys got this set up years ago and just forgot about it
Very baisc, and uninteresting
However, this is not good because it does not prepare you well for the last project in which you have to do the whole project using R. This is almost like learning how to cook without knowing how to use a knife.
It is a good introductory course, but it relies too much on networks and could be confusing and demoralizing if you intend to pursue a career in systems biology.
But, the content was quite updated that was the only good thing.
A very high level approach.
The submission program tests the whole exercise regardless you passed some sections or not, which make the waiting times even longer.
The class carries the name of University of Duke and 70 euros are charged, so I think the learners would reasonably expect to see that the teacher puts lots of time to organize the course structure, in order to efficiently give as much as information to the learners within limited time!For example, I believe nobody would not say that the Week 2 content on confusion matrix is very consistently explained.
I believe if the course was longer (allowing for more space between unguided assignments) the class would be a little better.
The programming assignments, however, have very little connection to the lectures.
They stress more on math and theory.
This isn't a CLASS it's a workshop.
Thank goodness for fee waivers; I would have been so upset if I had spent my money on this course.
The exercises initially focusses on identifying a leader who we have worked with but It should also focus on how am I as a leader, what is my level of emotional intelligence, how do I scale up basis some test etc.
How about if I simply told you to "write the numeral 5, then the addition symbol, then the letter X, then the equals symbol, and finally the numeral 12", and then proceeded to tell you, step-by-step, what you should write on the page in order to solve for X.
Also the submitting projects work is complicated and should be made more easier.
Not recommended for the starter.
I didn't learn much from the video lectures provided by Berklee other than application of a few terms in music I'd never considered much with a background in playing instruments rather than playing a digital synth, like "ADSR."
Does not worth such a high payment.
Then the large middle section covers very basic info about the types of energy production (coal, oil, NG, renewables) in the world -- low in factual content considering the time spent on each topic.
This course is not as well designed as the preceding courses in this certification.
Due to many technical issues with GraphLab lib I have to reduce acitivity in this curse for only video viewing :(.
Course material and contents are quite interesting but, grading system specially peer review method is absolutely disappointing and kills the motivation.
The course is so simple and just has only a few interesting points.
This is real re-branding yourself.
The good parts were the evaluation of different marketing channels (traditional and digital) and various stats on how people spend from the industry (ownership of TV networks, time spent per day on different media, etc.
These could easily be edited out.
Week 2 quiz: Q.
I was really more interested in what I thought the course was supposed to be about anyway, Medieval Manuscripts.
The lectures were surprisingly dry.
"Course" is very self-directed.
Extremely superficial.
I have some experience using software with command-based interface (including R) for statistical analysis, and I am relatively good at searching and finding information independently, but this course was way too hard even for me.
Problems: the presenter is HORRIBLE.
Also the quiz are not very well designed either.
I take a lot of notes, so perhaps that's what slowed me down, but I also have a full time job and I intern on the weekends.
The information in the videos was very interesting and well presented.
However, there are too few to make up for it.
I wish there was more "meat" in the sessions and more availability to access the lecturers more readily when there was confusion.
NOT recommended for beginners.
However, Graphlab is no longer free to use for commercial purpose.
1.
I expected to have to learn quite a bit of material on my own, but even the references to additional materials were very thin.
I could have saved many days if more guidance on the project workflow would have been given.
e.
g.
Too much focus on technicalities - not management based.
You will learn some command line commands, git, Github, and what you will need for eventually using R.
I was a bit annoyed that this course is a requirement for the Data Science certification (which is what I am after).
At times it was difficult to comprehend the speakers.
New organizational structure?
The swirl exercises were helpful, but the video lectures and assignments were not.
// Even so, I come to Coursera because I WANT to be taught by an instructor.
She did not even use the video to highlight key terms or spotlight key references.
That is the fault of the course, I think, rather than my peers.
I like Dr.
Chuck courses, especially 2-4 in this specialization, but this course has no programming challenge and check only your ability to make screenshots.
However it has its share of problems :-little to no interaction from TA's or mentors in the forums-the quizzes are often out of sync with the lectures-the final exam has severe problems with questions (form not content).
In more detail, on the final exam, some of the questions don't even contain all the content to answer them.
Not the best one on coursera.
Sadly, It is one of the worst courses i have taken part in.
For an experienced programmer, most of the exercises were easy, but I admit I had to look ahead on two of the projects because the instructions were too lacking.
It is only the basic to get the idea of how to organize the work.
This course is for people who are already relatively happy.
Quite annoying the continuous advertising of the professor's book.
There was a lot of questions on the tests that were never covered in the videos.
Rather than providing explanations like: "We don't need to go into detail on this, only x concept from it is important for what we want to focus on.
I often felt tired and confused since these long videos seldom got to the point.
For multiple modules, the questions were out of order.
The material itself can be covered in 2 weeks lecture.
The other star in my review goes to "Swirl".
I'm not sure if I was just jarred by the change in instructor, but I found her manner of lecture to be almost belittling.
I think that there should be much more guidance on how to give good feedback to peers.
In my opinion, the sound quality is quite low and this makes it difficult to follow the lectures smoothly.
Moreover, I was expecting that the course will be taught by a professor, but instead, it is done by a group of PhDs, some of them in their first year of research.
Much better use of your time.
Not sure how big proportion of the specialization students have a background different from data science and are going to manage the data science team.
The delivery would be much better if the instructor would put himself in the background and the focus be reoriented on a whiteboard style walk-through of the equation at hand.
Extremely basic.
The assignments would be easy except that the provided code has bugs, and some of the assignment details are wrong, making it very difficult to pass the test cases.
There is also very little information on how the work will be graded.
She is also very human, making mistakes as she goes along, and correcting them.
This course seemed to me the most un-interesting course.
Content is not updated.
The unfaithful use of "social" in few instance look like an altruism to social science by dominant discipline.
I am sure that this course has market.
This rendered the lectures simplistic, boring, and sometimes a waste of time.
And, indeed, what they created had both the worst and the best traits that England's historical jurisprudence offered.
It's a bit too simple all of this.
One wonders if this is because to choose a historian is to choose sides--that is how divisive this topic is.
Videos are very brief - slide presentations of course outline.
First of all his English is bad, sometimes you cant understand what he means even with subtitles.
The PPTs are full of errors and too direct, there is no continuity.
Although some time management tools are provided, the course is in general loose rather practical.
Too difficult practical exercises with the theorical background given.
More resources on how to complete them properly (for example, suggestions about how to do prototyping and what tools to use) would also help improve this course.
He took way more time than was necessary to get his points across.
Course covers mostly trivial stuff; lectures are just presenting code snippets; many inaccuracies; nothing about HTML5; entire 4-week-class can easily be completed in one week.
Definitely not near the quality I am used to from Coursera.
i do really disappointed because when professor starts the third & 4th week he was only throwing the information without enough explanation so i had to read more about the topics to pass the quiz .
The professor certainly knows a lot about this subject, but his delivery is stiff and dry.
I will finish the course, but I do not recommend it for someone who needs a technical approach.
Not really helpfull
Unclear points.
As a non programer, or mathematician, this course is too hard to follow.
Also, I was not aware that Coursera changed the auditing policy.
It was just not clear.
In my opinion, a very basic course...
It is too basic.
Even after having submitted my final assignment and peer reviewing others, it is not clear whether or not I or any of my classmates used the correct methods to complete the assignment.
The instructor needs improvement on her presentation skills.
Some of the ideas discussed are useful & new to me like linear programming and what-if analysis.
However, there was not any reaction to the comments in the forum from instructors and mentors.
This course could've been better by the inclusion of more examples, the lecturer is very monotonous and sadly, i see no discussion forum for this course, in addition to that, whenever i tried replying to the comments the reply button turned grey and nothing happened.
Strong accent
The instructor's presentations are so irritating due to him acting in a jumpy, nervous, and hyper-excited manner that I could not stand watching the lectures.
I think it would be better if the professor had covered Markowitz theorem, and showed how CAPM is derived from the theorem.
Not on par with the University of Virginia project management course.
Imagine this situation: you are not a programmer, not a graphic designer, not a writer and with a week you need to make a prototype of the game idea you’ve been working on course.
I can't even see where the "project" is coming, plus the strong accent of instructors makes it really hard to follow sometimes -- even with the subtitles.
The teacher needs to improve her delivery.
Course address some elementary issues about IoT, but the instructor at times seems like he does not have a good grasp of the lecture materials.
One suggestion i give to you that, please level of difficulty increase in a way that the learner not face to much thing in a single assignment.
Most correct answers are the first choices.
Please provide a good support personnel to at least help with online queries.
In conclusion I would recommend the Agile course from Alberta University instead.
Not really engaging, most of the material looks really outdated, and the instructor has a very "classical" way of presenting, which does not profit from the potentialities offered by Coursera.
It takes a lot of time.
Little to no support.
The whole specialization could have been designed to make better progress in modeling.
Empty of content
Lectures included errors in the code.
Most of the quizes dealt with syntax.
The lecture presents Google's ZMOT marketing model, how it benefited (and shaped) marketing research and strategies to increase conversion and loyalty.
Too theoretical, e.
g, comparison between statistics and ML is not at all useful.
I really liked the quantitative parts of the course and wish there had been more time spent on that and more quiz questions on that.
The reason I am ranking this 2 stars is that I felt the quizzes were unreasonably difficult (or perhaps they had bugs).
Therefore, I cannot recommed this course.
He obviously knows what he is talking about and presents the material in a clear and understandable way.
Then add the quiz questions from problem One above, and you're just wasting your time after that and building up frustration.
At times a direct contrast the the precursor class.
No follow up from teacher or teacher assistant.
For example, the first assignment had too much in it for a beginner, and a bit more homework, in smaller bits of the code prior to the assignment could have make a huge difference for the better.
Coursera s losing it's quality..
Worse taught
Too long, too academic, not practical.
I'm glad I didn't pay for this course.
Nothing new, obviuos advice and basic information.
Nice instructor, with a clear pronunciation and interesting videos in Module 4.
Hoping this course was just a quick primer for the R newbies.
Please look at this youtube video.
Disappointed
They tell you what to do and how to review your peers in one section and then the actually assignment has different instructions on what to do than the page prior so you end up unsure of what the assignment actually wants you to do.
Very hard to follow unless you have had a good deal of experience with programming.
nice teacher but the course is too succint.
Each lecture is very short and theoritical with little visual content.
I really like the course however it was too short and generic, and writing a memo as a repetation of the course was not that exhilarating...
I haven´t used the discussion forums too much however I was expecting more on building business models...
Probably it will be the subject of the next package but still 3 courses were too little as coverage....
I really liked the alagories and interviews from real life experiences and thank you for the effort...
However, the written support material should be improved.
I respect anyone who has completed.
I was interested in this course but as it stands it is more like marketing hype than a proper course.
Not challenging enough.
Poor on camera delivery, lack of familiarity with the material and a tendency to just read the PPT slide on the screen are just a few of the problems.
I am not impressed with this course so far.
Not cool.
A good course, the methods and pace was not good enough.
Courses like these highlight all the problems (and there are a fuck ton of problems) but contain fewer answers.
Couldn't fiish the course.
Unfortunately, in quality it's closer to the latter: mixed quality, lectures that seem unrelated to their corresponding assignments, many errors (both typos and, more seriously, examples that don't type-check!)
The lectures don't add much to the course.
Too much focus on portfolio investments topic.
Would be nice if more interactivity was built in, via pop-up questions during the lectures and practice problems.
Also the many animations with the slides made it hard for me.
Final project is almost a joke to try and decipher how to create from scratch based on the ones they provided in the quizzes.
Honestly this data science course is getting worse as the months progress, you really should think of updating the content of the course if you want to continue to charge money for it.
Very very broad with no real depth.
Very general course.
Could have been delivered in 1 hour.
Grading level by other students somehow looks insulting regarding the time and effort which I put to think, write, explain and make videos.
Sometimes hard to understand the speakers.
The medical knowledge is also assumed to be relatively high, with no references to some of the terminology and background reading material that can bring one up to speed.
okay for an intro, not the most boring content.
the information was presented so slowly that it was hard to follow.
I understand that the Instructor is barred by time constraints (this is only a five week course, and an opt-in one at that), so I do relate to not wanting to inundate the class with reading assignment and lengthy lectures.
That said, the guidance and lessons are lacking-- even if the class was longer, I would still only give it 2.5/5 stars.
It appeared that the onus was on the Mentors to provide answers; for example, the professor mentioned that our scripts are meant to feature half hour pilots.
Many were fixed but there are still some errors/omissions and the second half of the course was very short of content compared to the rest.
It appears the teacher doesn't take the necessary steps to polish content and tests, everything feels unstructured and ad-lib.
the course is just 5 minute video of an overview of the topic then an assignment,many topics are replicated from previous courses in the same speclization
Pure waste of time and effort.
The quality needs to be redone, as this was not a completely satisfying experience for an 80USD course.
The lectures did not prepare for quizzes/assignments.
The videos were ok, reading materials added some value, although about three years have passed since the launch of the original course and the materials are all the same.
They throw formulas at you and read it aloud instead of explaining the nature behind those.
They change notations every lecture, sometimes in the same lecture.
This course should have been very good.
It is a course for those who are already involved into the topic not newbies.
I was more analyzing patterns rather then truly understanding the code.
Campbell is not a good lecturer.
The topics are treated mostly superficially, then suddenly go into too much detail sometimes (how to use IntelliJ IDEA, machine learning).
Subtitles are very buggy.
I enjoyed Mr. Farivar's talks much more, it seems like he knows what he is talking about and his presentations are well structured.
Finally, having read a book or two on the subject, the whole experience added almost nothing to my previous knowledge on ancient Egypt.
It would be way much better if some examples were included.
If you don't have the horse power to check it yourself, create automated tests to pass like other courses.
A basic knowledge of control theory is a must.
Algorithmic Toolbox consists of a series of slides containing slimmed down explanations on introductory algorithmic concepts, followed up with programming assignments.
Many of the Quizzes are very poorly worded.
I am very interested Special Theory of RElativity but I ll just get a book.
The course is interesting but topics are sometimes way too difficult to follow through.
excessive use of GraphLab create which is not an industry standard.
The TA then stepped in and said (I paraphrase) "oh, we just dropped those terms because they're not so important, but we didn't mention that..." If you are not going to adequately support the students, the material had better be bullet-proof and show some linear thinking4 - The last exam.
Especially in comparison with other, in-depth course of this Specialization.
This course should be presented as a challenge course to people that have already learned Python Pandas from some other venue.
Their diet?breakfast: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheeselunch: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheesedinner: rye sourdough bread, butter, cheese and potatoes, along with some vegetables in the warmer half of the year, and small amounts of meat on SundaysContrary to four fundamental recommendations in the course, these people ate a lot of saturated fat (butter) and animal protein (cheese), but few vegetables and had hardly any variation in their diet.
They did prepare their own food, grown or pastured locally, in very mineral-rich soil, which imparted their butter and cheese with very high amounts of fat-soluble vitamins A, D and K2.
I cannot explore my interests with this sort of setting.
A really interesting course on a fascinating and often misunderstood topic.
I have abandoned it as it is yet an other exposition of Buddhism.
An intro to logic should be considerably simpler, and with more interesting content and exercises.
Finally, one quiz marked a question wrong and then, in the comments, noted the answer was right.
Further, some of the videos seem to stretch out information to fill time.
This course is a little too deep into programming and a little light on learning the basics of R. I would recommend splitting out the more advanced programming concepts in this course and offering them in a course near the end of the specialization.
This course should be higher level and give the user a wider view of R. Currently this course seems to assume significant knowledge of R or programming in general, making it not a good early course in the specialization.
I hope the instructions were cleary and not too vague that it was open to many interpretation.
Personally, I feel that you should lower down yourself and speak to the level of your students/audience.
the videos wasn't interactive, to much theoretical parts...
less practical you can't solve the assignments depending on the tutorials you have to google for the answers and know how people can solve the problems.......
I recommend if there will be a new version to put these points in consideration
In this case, it may have been because I'm a professional developer, just not a web developer.
Repetitive and stating the obvious from all sorts of angles.
Googling a bit will have roughly the same effect, though.
Could have been more useful
The course is put out there and students are left to their own devices.
It wasn't until about the last week that some official teaching staff started to make an appearance.
This was an issue as, especially in the first week, as there was a good deal of discrepancy between what was on the grading rubric, what was provided in description for the homework, and what was in an optional video that described the homework.
I have given you a 2* star rating as on finishing my course promptly all the information I submitted has suddenly been locked!
Finally, I would like to have a document in the course resources that students can download and keep that contains all the information we taught like quick reference guide.
I won't knock Mr. Caffo like some of the others here have because at the end of the day everyone learns differently.
It tries to cover a lot of ground.
The guided meditations were wonderful, but the introductory lectures for Weeks 1-5 were redundant and boring.
Feels like you have to sit through a lot for very obvious information.
No instructions for PC are provided whatsoever.
These were very short lectures without a lot of content.
But it suffers because one, the lectures are boring and lifeless (can you imagine graphics design being BORING?
Unnecessarily verbose.
Perhaps unsurprising, as these competing services often feature professional communicators rather than professional researchers.
Many of the quiz questions are arbitrary, rather than really testing knowledge gained in the class.
Dijkstra and A star algorithms courses are a bit short
Professor Dinham's investigative and research based approach is great, and in my opinion much needed in the professional educational community worldwidely.
:(
very essential
The videos and explanations are very poor.
To make this course more effective and to allow students to learn more effectivelly and get some learning objectives, more material besides the videos must be made available.
This caused a great deal of confusion.
Weekly assignments asked questions about skills that had not been taught yet.
Even though they could use some polishing too, especially the final Lab, they are indeed very helpful and do a much better job at clarifying the concepts presented.
All in all, I feel that if you want to learn about Bayesian Statistics you should look for another course, and/or save your money and get yourselves a good textbook.
Sorry, the professor has a genial & cheerful personality, but the program material is just too basic, and it takes forever to wade through it all.
If you are not a good programmer, think twice.
Although it claims the project at the end of the course is optional, it will not let me complete the course without doing the project.
I didn't feel like I really learned any of the concepts behind this material after going through the course.
Lots of readings!
IN KhanAcademy e.
g.
just started so tryen to get a hang of it ill rate better later if i like it but my minds tellen me that im going to be rating you guys 5 stars later in the futer
However, the instructor needs to develop better teaching skill.
For completeness and ensuring that everyone is on the same page, I suppose it it required.
I'm not here (and paid) to be trained to use something the instructor is trying to SELL, nor will I ever recommend this product for commercial use.
This course fell far below my expectations and failed to rise to the level I've expected in comparisons to other courses I've taken via Coursera.
It also would have been easier to understand if the information presented were to be broken down into smaller sizes.
I think assignment 2 can be paced differently - now it feels that we have a bunch of very easy parts (a-g) that is not very interesting, where the last three are significantly harder.
Considering how difficult this course is compared to other courses, the lack of real assistance is appalling.
Seemingly outdated lessons.
A lot of errors I get come from version discrepancies.
The assignment questions were often nebulous.
Although the lectures were clear and concise, going back to them really didn't help me with the assignments.
The terrible ones need to improve their teaching skills and even language skills.
My essay has been sitting in a student review cue for two months now - so, no completion of course and the program has the audacity to mark me as 'late submission'.
Broad overview, but I didn't really learn anything.
These videos are useful and mostly understandable.
You don't need to watch 4 weeks of coursera video and perform tasks to get it.
Some things are useful, such as the table "task list", but I would say there isn't enough of this type of help.
The interviews with real people are the only redeeming factor.
But critical functions that are part of the company's value chain or the critical functions that give the product or service value to the customer, should really be outsourced.” I assume that was supposed to say NOT be outsourced, otherwise it doesn’t make sense.
Lesson 1.3: the link to the IRS page isn’t hyperlinked.
The project at the end requires actions that data scientists should know but does not actually talk about the items.
Felt like it was put together on the fly.
The software video tutorials need to be updated ..
for example mac users need to use different programs which raises all sorts of different questions on where to go and where to find what Dr. T is working with for the lesson , second this is for beginners we would like to know why we are typing certain commands and what they do ... he has a good attitude but explanations need to be a little more detailed on what things are ,what they do and why we are using them... for any mac user you will be better off using parallels to install Windows and use this lessons with the programs he is working on like Visual Basic which is only for Windows ....
Very interesting course material, however, texts are often in such bad English that they are incomprehensible, and the staff does not react in the Discussion section.
It seemed very useful and interesting.
This course is fun, but the instructor or course admins need to put more videos, contents and information to the course than just a few videos, few topics per week like this.
I would recommend reading the docs on the bootstraps website, this course doesn't add much value to just the normal bootstrap docs
I have to admit, that most of the videos confused more than they helped.
We got all the info from the readings.
There is little guidance presented on the methods required.
Very basic course, very easy to follow and not at all challenging.
Did they even try?
I believe that if you are going to test people on something, you should at least cover it in some sense.
First half covers HTML and CSS and quite understandable and easy.
Its structure of super short videos (~4mins) with easy "tests" was neither challenging nor useful to confirm the value of the content, in fact a number of tests quiz you on material not yet covered (usually in the next unit).
I can't say I'm sure of the answer to that.
Lessons should be checked over.
... good luck.
They talked a little about LDL and HDL which is good.
But the rest was just a summary of avoid processed foods, eat less and eat less meat and ways to do it.
its just some ancient methods in new quadcopters.
Please improve material or get a better instructor.
On the strengths, it began with a high note and got me glued with expectations and promises.
I'd suggest you look at Wikipedia or YouTube for better classes.
I'd like to draw special attention to the quizzes, as often they're on trivia from the lectures and not reflective of the actual nuts and bolts of working with machine learning.
This course is too elementary.
There was just the required minimum for a MOOC.
articulation needs to be improved, talked too fast, content doesn't give much
(5) Programming presentation and assignments can seem like exercise in graphlab and SFrame functions rather than machine learning.
PRO:(1) Class presentation by Professor Fox on recommender system is detailed and clear.
TL;DR -- Good videos but short and not always relevant material; the course should be titled "A First Light Introduction to Strategy Implementation"The "Strategy Implementation" course is rather a first introduction to the concepts.
Unlike the HTML course which precedes it, this course was lacking information and structure.
PAINFUL.
This module is just enough material for 1 or 2 lectures with "How to get started" notes..
I think this course does not a good job of explaining the mathematics very well.
In my opinion it should be using an open source python library and not focusing on the Dato product.
I'm sure Professor Hinton has contributed much to the field, but I suspect his passion lies in playing with ideas and theories, not in trying to teach the next generation about how to do so.
Aimed only for people with zero background in the IoT paradigm.
The materials are just not there, not in the book either.
The course taught the basics of planning pretty well.
The teaching staff, unfortunately, was completely unavailable.
I'd say some knowledge of advanced coding was required in order to complete the assignments, or alternatively, lots of time to learn by yourself on google and forums, which wasn't really the point, was it.
I lost , and I could not continue , because It just came out of nowhere , coding , there wasn't a previous step that says , we will encode here , or are we going to do this somewhere ... just appeared and disappeared as it appeared ... ... we were very well ... but I can not say much more !
The quizzes were way too easy, you didn't even need to follow the course to be able to pass it.
The extra articles and links were one of the highlights.
The material covered, however, does not need 6 weeks worth of lectures.
Dry Material and the second professor was
I would put it down to a personal fault, if it were not the case that I grasped the notation fully within minutes of finding another source of learning.
Its theoretical.
No practical project to do
Very basic info suited for highschool students.
It was hard to keep traction and interest to finish it.
I'm coming from a python background and am totally new to c/c++..
I think this course assumes you have a lot of knowledge about both biology and statistics that I do not have, nor will anyone else who has only taken the first intro course.
I am planning to move forward with Python, and to keep reading the booklet which is good (I like the introduction about the HTTP, XML, JSON and SQL databases) but sorry Dr Chuck I will not complete this specialisation, it is overpriced for what it is !
Information design is about the visual display of information in a way that aids comprehension.
Its a good practical lecture but I think it have lots of room to improve.
Nothing more than instruction videos.
If you have a lot of time, that is perfectly fine.
I wish your peer reviews had less of an outcome on your grade though.
The text download files (i.
e.
The rise of video, images only grew as the technology evolved to allow easy distribution.
Its content can be covered in one session and does not need 4 weeks.
I am interested in all these questions, but for some reasons I lose my attention every time.
The positive side, it introduces you to Web API's, the basics of Beautiful Soup, and other BUZZWORDS.
However, the research discussed does support what I have learned from listening to the podcasts from the Institute for the Psychology of Eating.
The Course is not easy for someone who is new to programming languages, I myself with 2 years of programming knowledge with other languages I found it difficult to understand, the only thing I liked about this course was swirl training it was pretty easy, fun, and clear.
Assignment was too hard and the descriptions are not that clear specially assignment 3
Too short.
I had a hard time paying attention to the woman speaking and dropped the course after completing week one.
Being a true beginner w/no background in programming or data science, I felt the programming assignments were way too far a stretch from the Swirl exercises (which I felt were super helpful and beginner appropriate) and lectures.
Interesting subject, the presenter is hard to listen to though.
I was expecting more tips and tricks how to change well known theory to practical life.
this will give you some fair idea what do i mean.
https://www.
youtube.
com/watch?v=V0AWyzVMf54During the session speaker need to be visible on top corner and they need to present with more examples during learning this will help and learn fast.
I struggled a bit following your videos going back-and-forth with the given materials.
I also struggled solving the assignment due to confusing questions.
Sometimes you also have to go to an external site in order to do the activities, which are badly designed and just frustrating.
It's one of the worst courses I have ever enrolled in.
The questions are not well presented and there is a clear violation of the help and error recovery heuristic for me.
The only resources offered to help learning are a few open source visualizations.
prefer inline over function call, const vs #define, declaring variable anywhere in the code etc...
The topics are too small and too much time is devoted to them.
broad overview on
Getting Started: Agile Meets Design Thinking is a University of Virginia course that also is a great example of how these courses should be done.
This is a tougher class than advertised.
Only the last module on presenting goes a little further than making you ponder on abstract themes.
Some explanations are too short.
Quizzes and Assignments are poorly designed.
Most of contents are already in the books like Cracking the Coding Interview and similar ones.
So much time spent on European effect on British law: this is not a course for lawyers, I would presume, but supposed to be an introduction.
I would say path to reborn to what real open source world is living in.
The topics presented seems just a bunch of topics next to each other.
If you use GitHub and RStudio, the meat of the course is only about an hour of the lecture.
Could have skipped this one.
For me i like to have a devise design perspective on the MOS components .
The low rating is primarily based on the fact that I could not do the practice assignments and that coursera took away the ability to complete assignments and take quizes.
The instructors didn't respond to questions on the discussion forums about quiz items, the majority of assessment items seem to be available on Google and 50% of the peer reviewed assessment I checked used plagiarized solutions.
The lectures are really short in duration and the quizzes aren't challenging.
Week 1, 2 and 3 were pretty weak in my opinion.
She just started with wk 2.
Assignment X Tips), which is good.
Good overview of the EU but you cannot do the quizzes unless you pay.
May be there are topics that needed to be introduced for Course 4, will see, as I'll be doing straight after.
I think this portion of the specialization would be much better if it focused more on the value of these tools rather than trying to get us to install them.
The last week is pretty interesting though!I am taking the full business analytic course - and find that the quality and complexity of content is all over the place!!
I found the exercise nitpicky and confusing, and there's no indication nor review of what actually you did wrong.
I honestly thought this course was all over the place and too general.
Everything about this class needs some work: the videos, the instruction/syllabus/content, and the assignments.
However, the instructions are mostly quite vague or even misleading, occasionally dropping some “hints”, which are often either not helpful, or just offer to copy-paste a quarter page of code.
HiFirst of all I just want to write I have a background in mechanical engineering and I know the working principles of solar cells quite well.
The course also points to some resources in order to extend your study on UAVs.
The lecturers seem unprepared and they talk very repetitively.
As it is, it is a matter of time until Wharton and U. Michigan spread their offerings into this specific field and with a superior approach they will most likely divert students to their offerings, probably lowering and marginalizing your courses.
But despite my critics it is fair to salute you for your efforts and availability to offer this course.
I wish yoy luck.
Ricardo J. Oliveira
It all just makes it seem like the teacher doesn't really care and just wants to sell the course to a lot of people without putting in much effort.
If you are not following the specialization I would not advise this course for beginners.
I've spoken to a dozen people who have taken this course, and if you don't have some programming skills, you'll struggle.
There a a huge number of quizzes over poorly explained (or not at all explained) models, which would still be an interesting challenge if the models themselves had better explanations.
of the crystal defects would have helped.
Needs to be more engaging.
A first year undergraduate student can pass this
I think the course is FAR too expensive for the content provided.
If that's what I was looking for, I could search the web for blogs.
More often than not they put me to sleep.
No one responded or addressed them.
Finally the contents are infected with virus of medicine, market and military science.
And that's the feeling I get here.
This course requires a DIY attitude and a willingness to proceed without feedback.
If you're looking for a good example of online learning, look elsewhere.
However, I still found the pace was too slow, with too much distraction ("funny" videos, teacher drinking and making mistakes, hummm !!!).
This teacher is an amateur.
Too basic knowledge, not enough information about targeted therapy, everything is explained without going into any details
It is probably a first time for you guys to use an online platform as a media so it will take a couple of iterations to get it right.
I did like when you illustrated Isc and Voc in terms and abbreviations.
The contains of the course is not really enough for improve the writing skill for scientific paper.
Good Course, badly organized.
?c) It is obvious to anyone with even trivial financial expertise that the financial system today is weaker than it was before the crisis.
This instructor reads of a script!
The third project (fuzzing and symbolic execution) was a joke: "Type this and tell us what you see."
First noticeable thing is that the instructor doesn't convey competence very well.
In fact, now I am learning from coursera staff that may be there are not enough students to grade my peer review assignment.
So please do audit this course but do not be trapped in specialization.
Cheers..
The course contains no dialogues, or any real situations where vocab's being reviewed.
The instructors barely introduce the topics, and then point out that we don't need them, we can just "Google or Yahoo" for the information.
If you just need a shove to get you moving down a path, this might be helpful, or if you are brand new to HTML, this would be a relatively painless way to check it out.
This course needs an overhaul.
Frustratingly fought my way through the lessons and failed to clearly retain what I was trying to learn from Prof. Germano.
The course material is fine.
This course are pure lectures, no practice beyond open-ended questions.
The content is good, but the pace is too slow.
Not much substance to this course
Sometimes the lessons were very hard to follow and the quizzes often made little sense.
However, I think the course pace is too fast and should be include more 'non-greece symbol'.
I was excited to learn a bit about using document-based databases and JSON parsing and transport.
Such a boring course.
Allow me to repeat : several slides presenting the show() function.
Finally the assignments are unimaginative and mechanical.
boring assignments
It was a very frustrating experience.
He's lecture is sometimes colored like a stereotypical Texan.
But personally I think it's not.
It talks about so many things but none of them are explained clearly.
Very few and short videoes that only scratches the surface of Cybersecurity.
It is a shame that education and securing the learn success seems not to be the focus anymore - it seems that focus turned towards monetization.
So before taking the course be aware that you can not get a participation rate of 100% due to locked quizzes, which will only be unlocked once you paid.
Charging along with Mr. Boring and a map of Alaska behind him as concept after concept - difficult ones for folks who aren't like me with lots of background - is a perfect recipe for lack of comprehension.
If at least the mentors could set some interesting subjects and comments to motivate that, would be of help.
Due to this, my expectations weren´t met.
The content of the course is extremely useful, however assignments need review as the exercises results have mistakes and they are not explained very well (missing step by step guidance).
An unexpectedly disappointing, and in fact, downright awful course.
If I could - I wanna leave this course.
My eyes are glossing over trying to sit through these 15 minute long videos of him just explaining concepts rather than having me put them to use.
I do not recommend this course to anyone unless you have a Bob Ross fetish, and like listening to monotone talking.
I greatly enjoyed the material presented in this course and while I do not doubt the proficiency of it's creators the poor standard of spoken English of its two main presenters prevents me from recommending it to colleagues.
There's a lot of detailed information here, but it's surface level at best.
Did not live up to expectation.
It is not useless information it is just very out of place.
Learning some git commands was the most usefull in the course for me.
Entonces se converte en mucha teoria con poca practica.
The course stresses "You'll need to program a lot to gain experience, so you'll be doing it a lot of programming in this course."
Not once in the lectures were we ever taught HOW to do this.
Was nice not to have to watch videos though, and the slides are good.
The instructor seemed better prepared with her presentation, but her dependence on the textbook and speaking style still made it seem as if she lacked mastery of the subject.
This course is quite outdated.
The instructor speaks too slow.
Course comes in huge amount of concentrated videos.
Not is it only too easy, thus not actually testing students what is learned, the answers for some of the questions are incorrect.
The course was very superficial, mostly with tips and hints.
It's good to be aware that the option for performing the quizes and tasks were unavailable, making it hard to evaluate the experience of the course fully.
This course is less informative and systematic than I expected.
The material is hardly explained step by step.
It seems dodgy that the instructor is a CEO of a commercial tool vendor and is "encouraging" students to use it.
The quizzes in the course were extremely shallow.
While I appreciate the work that has gone into making this MOOC, there are better courses available on Coursera to learn this material.
First week of 3 min video.
The backbone of the course was useful, but I thought the lectures were lacking depth.
I think this course could have been done in two 30 minute videos.
Although the topics were interesting, I didn't find them very well presented in spite of the enthusiasm of the lecturer.
The instructor shows slides with generic statements and then reads them slowly.
Provides a comprehensive overview, however it is heavily lecture based.
Content was a bit irrelevant
As a result, confusion occurred sometimes more often than true learning.
The video lectures are often overcharged with many different varieties of a processing method that is not well explained.
Only 2 * because of technical issue that i faced in most of the videos are not loading properly .
However, the material on describing the machine learning algorithms were excellent!
But this course has the limitation on following grounds1.
The college course paradigm is dying because we can do it better now.
This is certainly a message that many people need to hear.
Unfortunately, the advice concerning what to eat is less sound.
Especially the last quiz I found very difficult based on the limited number of exercises presented upfront.
It was like someone is reading a book for you.
I liked the Youtube MIT course on Probability (it includes Bayesian Statistics) much more, since it has good explanation of the concepts.
R programming is considered nearly essential skill, if not fundamental, to data analysis.
At the same time, it also didn't provide enough clear examples of how to do basic things in matplotlib, which seems to me to be a very non-intuitive thing with poor documentation.
Don’t mumble.2.
I Feel that I usually am missing the big picture.
I am disappointed...
This course is rather bad, not well rehearsed and hastily delivered.
Maybe on a game of Jeopardy?Sorry for the length of this, but I hope you find the information helpful in deciding whether you will benefit from this class.
Course is good, the reason I'm giving it a low rating is because it's a little redundant with course 3 "Introduction to Meteor.
js Development".
Logic can be fun, but this class pretty much kills that spirit by burying it under pretty horrendous and tedious formalization.
Is it a course about private life of Dr. Alexander or about Managing Talent?
The quality of the course is not as I expected from a Coursera course.
Not very helpful.
As a whole poorly prepared course.
There's no official response in the forum.
There needs to be more testing on a variety of incoming skill sets.
The course overall is still very positive and the prof. clearly has put in a lot of effort and they are greatly appreciated.
Beware this course, especially if you are new to this area (despite what the course/specialization says).
repetitive.. long.. too academic... unnecessary terms....
The balance of instruction to exercise was very low.
Don't keep me chained to my laptop watching a static image for ELEVEN MINUTES!The instructor droned and was clearly reading from a script.
too repetitive, and i do not want to submit a video of my self teaching.
I was hoping that there would be some conceptual grounding in what each tool was useful for, but that was not present at all.
They made it a homework assignment for week 2, but didn't make it clear that it wasn't due until the end of the course, even though Coursera sends you emails saying it's due soon.
Only good for coming to know the terms that are in use in the industry and their meanings.
If not, you will have learnt a bit about human perception a sound perception.
It has some useful tips and tests for beginners in Personal Time Managment.
I would recommend this only if you want to show this certificate to someone.
Assignment instructions were too vague and the pass/fail grading system meant lots of classmates were upset that their work was not appreciated or understood.
It's not worth it.
Although it is a very informative class and Chrissy is a good teacher, I am finding this class to be EXTREMELY troublesome unless one possesses the means to purchase a great deal of equipment and product to work within Pro Tools.
This combined with the unorganized nature of videos(just winging it) made the lectures distracting.
I failed to figure out how to translate the theory (presented in the lectures) into practice (the only assignment, a website audit).
Also, some of the assignments are designed in a pretty strange way (e.
g.
Your friend is now a practiced sorter!These courses are really for folks who can spend much more time than advertised.
The assignments were weakly correlated with the lectures, and no explanation was given for correct answers or for incorrect answers.
I believe the authors would have benefited greatly from getting outside feedback from an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student, rather than each other.
Last assignment too ambiguous, peer assessment was completely random and not reliable to pass the course.
The introduced tools are very basic and I would have expected more content for the prize
I also did the course in 9 weeks instead of 16, but I did watch most videos twice so I feel I did dedicate some time to it.
Kevin Hartman was clearer
I do believe though that the course is very green and certainly has to undergo some refinements and I will be happy to see future reviews shadow this one as obsolete.
I assume the pacing is to allow for people that may have difficulty with learning the language.
Introduction is fine.
I'd expected more based on the generally good reviews.
So along with a lot of important topics, "The Big Picture" is missing.
Assignments should be much more clear in terms of what is expected from the students and how to approach the problem.
You only have to get 50% to pass the quizzes, which indicates how difficult it is to understand the material.
The instructions on this project weren't quite so blunt as to say "Take this data set, do some regression-y stuff and come back with something about these two variables," but that's basically as far as our instructions went.
I contacted a friend who's an influencer in different communities to me, with what your "expert" suggested.
Just information presentation, like reading from a book.
The material is compelling and the lecturer is engaging, but the course is not well prepared.
Also - you need more graphics.
Waaay too basic and simple for a comprehensive principles course.
The content was fine but the delivery method and instructions were sub par.
Therefore I have dropped.
(There was some helpful substantive information that came out of that interview, but for the most part, I felt as though I was watching an infomercial.)
Should be lecture by Professor instead of BS student.
The content was not well organized.
Also should prepare slides and explain the Swift for more details.
More exercises needed in each weeks lecture.
Hopefully, this course should improve next time.
The entire course is designed to overload you with terminology to get you up to speed for the follow courses.
This course definitely requires prerequisite knowledge of calculus and matrix math.
His thought process is unorganized.
It will make the course a lot less frustrating!
Could have been different styles of management and approaches or even how leaders in the past like Dale Carneige would have approached.
No need to purchase the course, just go over the videos if you're new to digital.
Also, some of the assignments were confusing.
The organizational structure leaves much to be desired.
Course felt disjointed and not really finished.
Very confusing stuff, need better clarification in course description and the way the material is transmitted to the student need to be reconsideredBut very well made and interesting.
Also, I felt there were not enough examples or really life examples, especially later in the course when describing different types of date and analysis.
I see no reason paying for the sertificate and I am not convinced further cources of this specialization will deliver greater value.
to much theory
too much external references
There was nothing helpful in regards to meal planning with children (although there was useful information in the Lunch Packing Video.)
This course is not precisely bad, but it's very lacking compared to the other courses in the specialization.
This teacher reminds me of old aunties that tried to tell me how to think.
Easy and pointless.
I am really disappointed, to be honest!
I am a little disapointed with this course.
That’s when I gave up and decided to write this review instead, with just one assignment missing to complete the course.
Some of the teachers aren’t native english speakers, which is fine, but their english is very hard to understand.
!If you are crazy enough and actually want to learn something new or even consider to get the certificate, I would not recommend to participate in this course.
Everything seems to be about building a mobile phone app.
Much of the lectures are broad-brush and halting, simultaneously being too detailed as times and not broad enough at other times.
Boring course... useless videos... only the referential resources and exercises are good
Dry principles without real life examples and exercises.
There was a lot of code to get through that could have been better organized.
teacher doesn't teach what is on the quizzes.
Difficult, fast peaced and not well explained.
- It will be really great that you can make the quizz and get your results without paying, because you will not get the verified certify.
By far to introductory, I think that this course should be an extension of the iOS App Development Basics
This way everyone knows what to expect and what to look for.
The title might lead one to expect that methods of research such as qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method would be explored.
I passed this course with score 95% finished all quizzes, Programming assignments and swirl exercises.
Make sure all examples compile and type-check.2- Make sure you're not repeating content already in other courses, especially if they are part of the same specialization!3- If you're going to re-use content from other contents, make sure it fits the current course.
All theory.
It could have been one of the most valuable yet.
in financial statement fraud.
The instructors videos are great and have been helpful but the rest is lacking!
Good context, however, long videos, didn’t catch my attention.
I didn't like the python environment, I thought it will be more like Ng's course.
The simple assignments are described in 3 different places, sometimes with conflicting instructions.
It really seems that he like game development, he make jokes and try to make the course interesting.
The professor talks too much about the website and his book!
While the explanation of Why Galaxy and what the idea behind it was great, the content taught by the videos was more than basic.
In addition, the previous version was obviously about a different subject.
I was disappointed and continually frustrated with this course, especially since the instructors required me to pay fifty dollars in order to take the module quizzes and the final assessment.
This course was too repetitive compare to the previous course in the specialization.
the persons who transcribed the videos should have taken the time to see and hear what they were translating since there are quite a few errors on names, locations, even simple words).
It was also a little strange to me that the course began with a segment on job opportunities and how to begin a career in SEO.
This is not the case, so frequent pausing of videos and making lots of notes is needed if one wants to commit this course to long-term memory.
If I cannot participate in discussions, forums, submit assignments, or give reviews, I might as well watch youtube lectures.
The course content was very poor as well.
i think, this course content is a bit dependent on thought process..
it changes with individuals
Amarnath Gupta were difficult to understand, his examples were unclear and, in my opinion, too complex and difficult to follow and understand what was the reasoning thread.
The course can be a bit more interesting with real-life case studies.
This course is doable if you have prior knowledge of probability and statistics.
Poor visual communications, it should be better since it is the only way to follow the course.
Should be nice if the slides counted with a kind of animation to enphatize what we are talking about.
The teaching quality is very average and mediocre at best.
The assignments are merely implementation of lectures .
The Stanford and Princeton courses on Algorithms are better courses to take for one to pursue a serious study of Algorithms.
For example, what is the relevance of being able to remember that job losses at the height of the crisis were of the order of 880k a month or 200k a month?
I could no complete this course, unfortunately.
In other words, everything was kept at a very abstract level, and not enough detail was provided to actually do anything.
The videos didn't work correctly (sound and subtitles).
I don't live in those states.
I fought my way through the first three courses, but now I'm going to work smarter by finding other ways to acquire this knowledge.
Far too easy and too expensive.
A lot more.
That course is also rich in mathematical content and also requires a commitment of 4-8 hours per week.
I really don't think this course should arrange as the second course to take in this Data Science course series.
The instructor moves very slowly (both speaking and covering topics).
The pre-processing of the data was quite extensive (9 steps before generating the ngram tables I used in my model) and was the key to getting decent results IMHO, but one had to step on a quite a few landmines to figure this out.
The problem was an interesting one and I ended up reworking it after passing with 95% (the only class in the specialization I didn't get 100% on) because I didn't have time to implement much of what I had to figure out by 'hard-knocks'
Also it's getting old.
Very brief , some points are leaved without explanation
Missing substantial amount of information and lecture
I feel that the lecture material lacks proper explanation of the key concepts but the questions in quizzes are good although the lectures should have been more conceptual rather than theoretical
We really did not cover much of that, and it was quite punishing to search the web and sources to make things work.
The last assignment on Map-Reduce is acceptable although a number of errors in the homeworks are still uncorrected long after the first offering of this course.
I like the questions during the video, that is an addition that ought to be used more often, because it forces you to remember and learn faster.
presentation has to be better
I found this course disappointing.
I'm hoping the find something else that is truly an overview meant for someone without a science background.
The only thing I had to do in this course regarding the required assignments was to change python 2.7 code to 3.4 as that's what I'm using.
Presentations didn't add much towards the learning either.
The teacher is excellent.
This is excellent but poor introduction to HTML.
The course, which is part of specialization should be much more detailed.
The videos are very static, the content good but the course progresses in a rather slow way.
The thick Dutch accent and the lack of diversity in the speakers profile is rather paramounting (but I have followed only the first three chapters).
As one of the people that paid for this and all others in this specialization, this is the one I felt didn't return as much value to justify the payment with no "official" course staff seeming to be involved this round.
While the material is undoubtedly useful, te structure of the assessments is not very helpful.
Jack Wu is probably a heck of a developer but he's a terrible instructor.
I had not found it very enriching as a course.
I don't think the course is setup for a beginner or a person who has never used R...
very frustrated with needing to search the internet for help on everything that the course is supposed to be teaching me.
I studied the course full time to get a certificate to put in my profile.
Maybe this is the reason why I didn't learn anything in this class... :-(
Some problem even has more than one possible correct outputs, which is just confusing for learning purpose.
In terms of lecture videos, it's good that there are some classic algorithm problems being demonstrated in the video, however the linkage between how to express a problem in mathematical languages is poorly explained.
I actually think that the exercises are too complicated compared to the examples in the chapters.
The course is a shallow introduction to a set of topics about embedded systems, it tries to cover too much without really explaining the concepts.
I feel this gives the student a good experience of the real world iterative process that coding is, that even with experience mistakes are still made, and to be expected, and how to go about doing some debugging to correct those mistakes.
At least not with Accuracy.
I would actually recommend breaking out social, SEO and online advertising into their own courses, rather than squeezed into small segments.
The material was beneficial but I would have found the course more helpful if there were weekly assignments rather than one assignment at the end of the course that incorporated all of the principles.
I'm here learning Excel skills, but this course, especially week 2, does not teach Excel skills.
Some interesting ideas.
It is business oriented, it doesn't deal with interesting and challenging academic problems.
Not too interesting, but certain things were useful.
Practice tasks are boring - implement pseudocode given in lectures.
All of the other reviews I have seen for this course are a single line such as 'I liked the course a lot' or something equally vacuous and unhelpful.
The course is great however we have to pay to get all tasks or a certificated
I had much more expectations from this course but this was just a brief overview of content(Not covering all topics) of what actual International business should be.
Rather than just wasting time like this they should have been crisp and short but actually this professor was good at giving examples.
Can be packed into a two-week course.
Information was interesting, but not sure this is a good course for someone new to the nitty gritty of SEO.
PROS:- Classification lecture is good;-Weekly assignments are challenging enoughCONS- No slides provided.
Most of the content was already known to me, and in my opinion it scratches at most the surface.
The mix of materials from different courses hurts the structure of this course.
Also ... they couldn't even get Rob Stokes name spelled correctly in the references.
I have read numerous articles on the topic, so it brought me nothing new.
I completed Coursera specialization by Michigan University and it was completely easy with plain text, short sentences, so well made for international student.4th: this is boring.
To name one example, assignment 3.1.1 question 3 has at least three correct answers, but the grader accepts only one of them.
This continued, albeit to a far lesser extent, through the remainder of the course.
While I don't expect instructors to be in the forums all that often, I do expect them to clear up obvious issues, and to make some type of official statement as to how students should proceed.
Seemed like a "ghost" course, issues reported with the swirl package, duplicate questions in the final assessment, where is the instructor ?
A valid solution to the final project hasn't even been given to us as part of the course, so I'll never know whether or not I did it correctly.
Do not expect to learn anything new in excel.
All course material is just google provided document.
Also as in previous course there was no supervision from the staff of the discussion forums.
Some of the quizzes require 100% to complete with some problems being quite difficult.
I wouldn't even call this a full course.
This course is not very "beginner friendly"
Constant differences in data.
The Matlab code is written using the worst coding and documenting practices.
For what you pay for, this course is not worth it.
Way too shallow and way too english :(
Overall, it is not one of the best courses I have taken.
I atTRIbute certain ATtributes to native speakers who mispronounce important vocabulary.
Teaching style of teachers is very dry and boring.
Having completed the assignment after many hours of trial & error; here are some suggestions for improving the class for future sessions.
Increase the length and depth of the lectures so that more of the materials needed for the assignment are covered.
For each week, have an optional programming exercise (not graded) but with a model answer (with explanations of why) so that students have a concrete example on which to practice key concepts on.
As classes & structs are very important to completing the assignment (instead of just including the SWIFT manual chapter on classes & structs in the Follow Up Reading), include an actual lecture about this topic.
Improve the description of the assignment to be completed.
Had this been the first course in this certification, I would have dropped out and looked for a better program.
Thanks to the responses of other students in the forum, i can finally do some of the quizzes.
- because I need an aspirin after 20 minutes of Mr.
I found the first assignment to be very difficult.
But the material itself is not in a structured format that means you could lose your way half way through the video.
It was very dry with just slides and majority of the examples were not explained well.
Yet in this course, you will be told simply that al-Husseini was a "man of religion."
Yes, I know it is Phys Chem but I do think there must be ways to Jazz it up.
!I think one of the most important expertise and knowledge that a data scientist must know and master was unfairly squeezed in one week leaving no time for the learner/student to do more search/exercises on the subject.
The course provides fundamentals as advertised, but the delivery was not impressive.
Instructions for installing gulp was not good.
I don't feel like the videos were helpful in explaining and offering guidance.
Reasonable class about designing user interfaces, not much about cybersecurity.
Way too many abstract concepts that are not relevant to the challenges that I encounter in my day-to-day role.
But, really, does any developer not working in university would ever use it?
Too many interviews and some of them are pointless.
Not suggested unless you have it.
Terribly difficult to engage with 10+ min lectures in every lesson, plus unorganized presentations and interviews making extracting important information difficult; the lack of organization in the interview videos (which are SUPER long) made it very difficult to extract significant information for the course and assignements.
However, I hope this review helps the staff to improve the quality of this course for future students, considering that the teacher has a great methodology to explain the content.
Basically a very light summary of what cybersecurity is.
Key ideas are unmotivated (just trust me, functions are useful!).
This is a very basic course that introduces you to the topic, but doesn't go into much depth.
I also missed the bio in biostatistics.
That doesn't make any sense!
The capstone project had nothing to do with the previous three courses.
This course successfully covers the mechanics and control topics of quadrotors.
However, be prepared to question your own sanity, your skills, the software you use, software in general and just despair at times.
It is too easy as a "university" course.
She seems to have a discussion with herself about character building techniques but not really explain the technique nor structure it for the student.
There are too many shop talks.
I would rather have a structure explained to me and then hear a discussion... the way Brando Skyhorse does in the Plot course... really a let down.
Not very applicable for the real world.
Instead of that, videos are very short and provide only few information and don't allow us to pass the exams at the end of each module.
How does one organise data, get to know completely new data, understand possible value?
Its a classical case of bait and switch.
Thank you :)
His stories, or i guess metaphors that are supposed to help you understand and remember things are aweful.
personally speaking, the contents are not helpful.
Sholdnt be a different course.
This does nothing to add to the content of the course and is distracting and unprofesh.
The meaningless assignments let me down.
In other classes I have taken, there are additional resources and content for the paid users.
Unsyncronize subtitle with audio.
Poorly instructed.
Fairly good videos explaining the material, probably worth 4 starts.
If you already took statistics, this is a reasonable refresher.
Many errors in transcripts that you will just have to slog through.
Please we all have accents but i can not understand some words and makes it more difficult.
Geared towards ESL students.
The course was very basic.
Week 5's lesson should be reviewed as may have no place in class
but I did learn some
I was looking forward to this course and I am disappointed.
Very slow pace
U of G is considered to be a top university in the world, I am expecting an advanced course, at least teach us some asset pricing theories, such as APT, thanks.
The autograder for the final project was.. a complete fail.
Overall, this is a low content course delivered in a rather boring and uninformative way.
The two presenters format didn't work well as it made the lecture look informal.
This specialisation needs to introduce an actual final assessment by an actual expert, not peers.
Please, don`t be mad at me - lecturer is a very charming and charismatic person, but I simply don`t like how the material is presented.5th: I have a feeling like all slides are taken from some scientific books and lecturer reads comments from some science articles, it is not like described with own words, simplified for better comprehension, cleared with own real-life examples and in atmosphere of friendly conversation with some emotions and humor.
Please, take my feedback just as my personal opinion and hope other students will enjoy it more.
There is absolutely no support, unless you count snark from the aids who check into the message boards once and a while to tell you your question is stupid.
is very useful and interesting.
Concept presentation was good though.
This course is all over the place and I could see it being confusing for someone just picking up programming.
I would encourage the makers of this course to do a significant revamping.
All it's about visual design.
The terms used are too difficult to understand and way of teaching is too complicated.
I'm very much glad to be done, and congratulations to all of you who made it through this last and arduous process.
The course would also have been improved by the use of peer assessment on the assignments.
I couldn't take the instructor seriously.
The course gives practice in Python, but programming assignments were loaded with "busy work" that added little value and often had only loose ties to the material discussed in class.
Super basic, nothing to be learnt there.
Loads of room for improvement
Many of the assignments required you to do things against best practices, like inserting inline styles to make your element look like the instructor's screenshot of his page.
The last week's content seemed to be a slapdash mix of bits and pieces, and trying to inform people about Node modules via solving a quadratic equation seemed really strange.
The course in itself doesn't teach much, should have been the first week of subsequent courses.
Very disappointed.
they made this many courses as they can earn more money.
I dont think this course should me taught seperately
It seems out of place, and too little was done to relate it to learning python.
Moreover, learning databases and SQL is easy; rather than taking up a whole course, this content could be relegated to one week of lectures in conjunction with some external references for further reading.
it was too basic information/material for what I was expecting
Really poor quality of the material.
There are a lot of kinks to be worked out in this course.
The quizzes will repeatedly test on terms not even remotely mentioned in any of the course materials.
Although it is a great way for the students to search and enhance their skills by themselves, in general, the assignments should at least reflect the lectures.
Lastly, in my humble opinion, this course is not appropriate for someone who is new to programming and has not been familiar or mastered any programming languages, though the title is "introduction".
Professor misses no opportunity to pitch his book.
It's seemingly a great course for K-12 teachers but lacks relevance for higher education.
In particular I would highly recommend the Meditation Labs, the Science of Meditation videos and the short presentations from the Tibetan Buddhist monks .
This course was so dry....
Material is outdated and course assignments failed to challenge thinking and encourage critical engagement with the content provided.
Within the limited scope of the beta test I started the node red stuff.
Effective instructors know that students learn by seeing examples, not by listening to broad descriptions of what a function can do.
Very boring.
But overall, despite being initially interested in the topic and why people believe what they do, I didn't feel that the material was delivered in a way that captured my continued interest.
The teacher in the first few weeks is hard to follow; it sounds like he reads from a paper and he barely writes anything on the slides.
6 “improve employmentoutcomes” - somebody forgot a space.
Practice quiz 3.3, Q 1: “"Tell me about a time when you made a mistake" is what type of interview question?” - Answered Behavioral, but system marked wrong (but under the answer Behavioral note says “behavioral- tell me about a time”, so obviously it actually is the right answer.
It should be helpful for people who are not working yet or is about to start they first job.
You spend perhaps 20% of your actually practicing coding, and the rest is wasted in libraries you will never use again
Understanding which equations that were shown in the lecture (not necessarily explained) were useful in completing the assignments was not apparent and there was no help from the TAs.
I don't think the assignments were irrelevant but without having a background in academic engineering the course needs to walk through similar exercises with explanations to increase understanding and ability to complete the course.
While I don't think this course was well presented and I can't say I truly learned anything I am glad I was exposed to the material and I will continue with the Specialization.
There is quality implicit in the approach taken, but in my opinion, this course is excessively short, having only 20-25 minutes of videos per week, what is very limiting.
Not that good if you have experience with other programming languages.
It's waste of time and money, you should take it as audit.
So, he’s personality is makes the course less boring.
Cons:- The course name: when I saw “design” in the course name and the icon of course page, I thought it would be related to graphic design, or history telling and so on.
it is good for non-English native speaker.
Infographics for Journalism might be a better title.
It tries to reduce creative writing down to a formula instead of acknowledging that many compelling and successful stories can have almost any imaginable form.
You could be fixing it right now and improving the course.
Oh, if only we had more tools to stop this, never realizing their role in creating the crisis.
Awful teacher
This felt like an introductory level course, made more difficult through poor teaching.
Also, the slick web interface was slightly difficult to navigate in comparison to other Coursera courses.
Probably next time I will need to look it up again.
Quality of presentation slides is below average.
instructor advice is primarily to 'use stack overflow'.
I got a LOT more out of the other courses in this certificate.
But it was not as much a class as it was a series of homework assignments and the student painstakingly looking things up on stackoverflow.
Maybe, I am already somehow experienced, but I think that the time I spent on that was a waste :/
From that perspective, the course is as advertised.
I also didn't need to watch 10 seconds of an animated caveman grunting and smashing things on the screen.
There was not the same application of programming skills as in the previous courses.
I can understand that this will hopefully drive students should do more research, but if they hit a wall, realistically they're going to keep iterating on the answers until you pass and learn nothing because of the time pressure to complete by the end of the week.
Maybe I'm wrong, but I expected something more than trivial division.
The quiz was far harder than it should have been, mainly because the professor failed to properly introduce and teach students to use the formulas.
The instructor voice is annoying after 2 minutes.
The course has nearly nothing to do with the previous themes.
The instructor is very warm and friendly, but not well articulate.
Please fix thisIMO, I think the video must not too long.
Good idea, but, with a few exceptions, less than average execution.
This class is a let down.
This course hasn't been upgraded to Python 3.
I was looking for a course that discusses how to think about the data and how to manipulate the data based on the questions you have.
In return, you have to review three other people's videos.
Further, the solver addin (needed for the week 6 assignment) is not consistent across different excel versions and libre calc, which resulted in a whole lot of guesswork to pass this assignment.
Too much on California systems, not enough on direct coping with day-to-day.
Too much emphasis on plagiarism.
This course is not terrible, I learned a few things, but it is poorly designed.
Some things are explained as if to people who aren't familiar with the concepts at all, while others are explained as if to people who must already know a lot about the concepts.
To summarize, I think it is a waste of opportunity to not use the video/interactivity/collaboration platform to its fullest potential.
Definitely a very light course designed for beginners and to promote the Leiden's 3 Years International Studies Program in Safety and Security!
I went through all 4 weeks in 1 week, the whole course is mostly about downloading different tools and signing up for accounts.
What I didn't like is that the teachers seem to be really concerned about their reputation and workload.
And knowing he was involved in the official 9/11 report makes him hard to believe on any issue.
The professor does not pronounce the words correctly.
Still useful for someone like me that never done financial engineering, to find all the concepts in one place.
Many of your homework assignments are based off of if people can understand the instructions of the game- which, if you have mostly non-English speakers, sort of takes the homework from being "be creative and challenge yourself" to "make sure everything you write down is 3 words max or else the people GRADING you won't understand it".
And, finally, the uploading of the last assignment was just impossible for more than a week, and I don't know if it will ever be possible.
All these terms used, no relevant examples, too complex words and so on - I lost concentration, I had to google a lot of unknown terms, I had to stop lecture every 30 seconds to reread or repeat the peace of lecture, because I could not understand it.
Expecting a lot better from the next course in the series.
While reinforcing the theoretical background (mostly repeating same postulates from the Theory course), this course contributes very little to its name (practice).
If you are looking for a simple introduction / never seen an interview / have no experience with public speaking / have not taken many oral exams then this is for you.
I rate this at 2 stars because I was expecting more.
A sharp decline in quality and cohesion from the Functional Programming Principles in Scala course.
But the marketplace for quality online education is definitely becoming a competitive one.
The videos should be completely reconsidered.
No videos, no active forum, no explanation.
The course didn't feel as though it was aimed at a university level audience, which is what I expect from Coursera courses.
Argumentation throughout the course is shallow, many of the the current arguments are not mentioned - from both sides of the energy lobby (fossil & renewables).
Also the way quizzes are designed is not - in my opinion, very well planned.
And now I am at one point in the course, that is "Flow of Probalistic Influence", where she explains a concept without explaining what is meant with the used underlying notions "flow" and "influence" which makes me difficult to understand what is going on.
While I am not opposed to some searching of other sources, I would like to have more of the useful information taught so that it is not so much of a burden.
This course is solely for teachers, on how to tech art to elementary school pupils.
Extremely basic
Too much math!
The lecturer does not clearly explain the topics very well especially on the topics in Probability and Distribution.
Scope for improvement.
A very big difficulty for me, French people who uses to speak english everyday for may work is that :1) Teachers don't do any effort to speak slower and to articulate2) As with all other courses I've attended in english, it's impossible to read a transcription, even in english, while reading slides.
Slides are not sufficient by themselves, i.
e.
They could've done better than use the same circles, squares and triangles to explain various concepts!
needs better and more relevant examples.
This course feels a lot like it's being taught by a non-teaching professor.
However, there are some issues concerning the assignments which I didn't like at all:1.
The three first weeks were almost completely dedicated to traditional finance accounting ratio analysis.
The pre-written code in the assignments is not so good.
Fortunately, I planned on paying for one at a time.
In my opinion, previous knowledge or R should be required.
Far too easy and far too basic for me.
It took so long to figure out things and I I didn't like the course because of that.
The teacher and the videos are very good.
Expected a lot more from the course.
I'm sure there were amazing games made by some of the non-English speaking students, but I wasn't able to understand and play many of them.
I wished it to be more hands on, more practical but unfortunately is like reading a book about social marketing.
I don't feel like I now have all the tools I need to do a through, structured content marketing analysis.
Instruction should be more fast paced.
I would recommend learning R and ggplot before this course.
Needed of specific information to now how to be more creative in schools as profesionales
I took the first class in this specialization.
the quiz is so frustrating
Not very informative, and too simple.
I understand that the goal was to teach the most in a short time but this was not the right approach.
I don't feel that this was particularly widespread but it did result in some loss of confidence in the course and time being wasted "interpreting"2 - Tests throughout the course that often provide the relatively limited feedback of "correct well done" or worse I'm sorry to say, the relatively useless feedback "sorry that is not correct", without ANY explanation of why it was correct or more importantly what an incorrect answer should have been and why.
Some are way too simple and some are highly complex.
Second there is no programming assignments, so its a little easy kind of.
Week 4 was excellent, Prof. Godefroid de Callatay's lectures about Magic in Islam were very well delivered and informative.
This class was bizarre.
Not well prepared course.
All of the course material and talk is available on Google documentation, didn't get to learn anything otherwise.
All in all, this course need some serious re-working, in terms of how the material is presented and how the assignments are phrased.
Can't you get the dino guy?
Not quite what I was expecting from a leading economist at Yale.
The good and bad examples are useful as well, but they are all too simple as well.
The videos are good quality though and there is some information that is useful.
If you want to learn JavaScript, this course is not for you.
This is a complex subject which encompasses many layers of meditation practice culled from historically earlier Buddhist traditions.
No or least support.
Course Quality is great but problems with grader will left you with wasting your expensive time.
Assignments are good but intend to go wayyy more beyond the scope and to learn from online materials though other sites.
Grading system is not easy.
sometimes there are misspellings - which makes it even harder to know what he's saying.
Not so impressed with this course so far, let's see the rest of the specialisation.
Sorry for the bad review, it's the first time I leave one like that, although I've completed many MOOCs.
My issue with this course is the lack of depth.
The class begins with analyzing Supply & Demand curves for energy use and production which was interesting to me and I thought meant we'd be taking an economic view throughout.
I wish the courses are more project oriented.
So I think a better name would be “Principles of Game Project”.
This is the third Coursera course I have completed.
Suggest reword in shorter statements that are more to the point.
The only thing I liked about the course were the interviews with people behind Python, but otherwise the course does not facilitate deeper learning and is not engaging.
After a couple weeks into the course, I just went straight to the slides, read MIT's Introduction to Algorithms, and skipped most of the course videos.
But all things considered, the course served as a good curriculum to guide my focus through the introductory concepts, regardless of where I sought it out.
I do not think that students should need to pay for a course in order to watch interviews with previous graduates.
I had to stop watching this course there.
I'm not sure why, there was a disconnect somewhere, I think maybe that I didn't receive the help that I feel I still need on the subject of how to create a great, memorable, believable character.
However, the most valuable thing I got from the course was the link to the lecture by Mike Sanders on Advanced Multi-tasking.
The reference material referred to is very light - there are no reading lists and one link is to an out-of-date web page.
The material this course provided is sufficient for a beginner in robotics.
(Wish I had a good recommendation as an alternative.
Very caotic.
Also, this teaches Python 2, which no longer cuts it, especially for an intro class where you'll be taking further work.
Boring techniques for remembering.
Nothing related to learning or understanding.
Do the twitter assignment and skip the rest.
Words are still key online--are there ANY websites major who do not use words?
Emphasis was on teaching Data Management with area of our interest.
I enjoyed and benefitted from some of this course.
The reason I don't rate the course highly is that it just wasn't that coherent.
These lectures could have been much shorter and would have been equally valuable.
I don't feel I have a better understanding of how smartphones work.
Although I am now more familiar with the tech components of a few smartphone models and the timeline of iOS/Android OS development, I am not able to connect this information outside of base facts.
I joined to learn outstanding experience but ... disappointed
I expected far more handy real life Excel examples, not to see a teacher speaking and writing stat formulas for hours.
The idea of this course is very good, it has some room for improvement.
The content seems rather thinner than that of earlier courses in the specialization, and seems to get more so as the course progresses.
Moreover, course staff were conspicuous by their absence on the course forums.
Lack of some practical tasks.
Much work needs to be done on this course to make it friendly to learners.
I wanted to have fun and learn more about the music that I think makes life more beautiful.
The course lectures were too sparse leading up to the final, very important assignment of learning to how to create an ETL package.
The questions with multiple choice work wrong: marking all the right answers is not appropriate, you must choose the "all of the above" option, but it is wrong because of formal logic.
ok. Worth the introduction to some useful tools.
Was looking for detailed service industry (financial) applications of process improvement knowledge.
If this issue is not addressed I will need to consider adjusting my star rating.
This experience casts a negative impression for me on the Coursera platform and University of Toronto teaching staff.
I'm disappointed.
What do you mean by order of applying filters?
No real teaching attempted in this course, as far as I can see...
I believe this is the wrong way to teach newbies because too much abstraction is never good.
Also, as a man, I was personally offended by Professor Susan Rodger saying she wanted to see more women in programming.
Either way I felt like I taught myself all of this material using web resources and got absolutely nothing for what I paid for.
Slightly better than the Statistical Inference course, but many of the same technical and delivery defects persist.
Because first assignment is to big jump.
Lot of typos and glitches, as well as typing in equations being really difficult
And according to my understanding, that was what I thought I was signing up for.
Paying $69 is just too much for this elementary course.
Very hard to follow and to understand if you don't have any mathematics background or statistic knowledge.
Some of the materials like the monkey example are a bit too childish and the sample articles can be too simple to be appropriate to learners at this level.
Some of the content are repetitive.
E.
g.
More examples should be provided in lectures, not just abstract math (e.
g.
But this is exactly the main problem with this course - for quizzes you should deduct and learn by yourself so much stuff, that videos start to be not worth your time.
exercises on time quadrants) could have been introduced & explained in detail.
Instructor was amazing.
A lot of the topics introduced are aimed at complete novices, yet not explained in a way novices might understand.
I felt that the Wade reading, in contrast, was balanced, cited other sources, and pulled in a variety of perspectives, but when I listened to the lectures, I felt that Professor Ogilvie had a tendency to state points and expect people to believe them.
Second, on a related note -- this course was not shaped for the online medium.
Wikipedia and some other online sources, and youtube videos, were more helpful but I think the real issue lay in the teaching style.
Probably guys did big amount of work, but the course looks extremely raw.
The difficulty of the assignments of the first three weeks just relied on sweeping (somewhat 'smartly') a 1,2,3, or 6 dimensional parametric space.
It could have easily been a 4 week course or even shorter had they not tried to belabor each topic.
I am nearing completion on two others.
Aside from a new interesting ideas (from a JFK speech and John Dewey), I found this course to be stretched pretty thin; I think this class would have been effective as a 2 or 3 week course instead of 9 weeks.
The only reason I gave 2 stars is because you can still learn SOMETHING with it if you are a complete newbie, but it is very far to be reliable if you are aiming to be a professional.
In reality, organ meats and egg yolks are higher in micronutrients than many fruits and vegetables, and only small amounts of dark-colored veggies and fruits are required to balance a diet that already contains a variety of meats (as far as both species and cut).
extremely easy and sparse content.
This is a very basic course, not at all college level.
Most of the times I would just ask myself why they did this and that but later they don't provide enough explanations.
I strongly recommend starting the material with a free signup and only pay if you really want the extra grading.
My other main problem was with the pace and detail in the course.
The course lectures were subpar and didn't cover the material in the assignments.
I don't recommend this to newbies
And here is where problem starts (at least for me).
The exercises are fun and challenging.
Unfortunate.
I realize this area is a bit more advanced but with all due respect to the knowledgeable instructors, they could have emphasised more on basic building blocks rather than cramming in so much information which my bandwith couldn't handle it.
The course is really way to easy.
You'll be much better off taking Andrew Ng's course, which is significantly more in depth and forces you to write your own solutions to problems instead of relying on a proprietary library.
The only reason to prefer this course is if you really dislike the idea of using matlab.
exponential distribution is explained as "for example if you are waiting for a bus that comes every ten minutes" and then he tells you how to compute expected value and moves on, but he does not say WHAT IT MEANS - is it the probability that I will meet an oncoming bus?
The course if well-organized and the instructors do a very good job.
I gave up on week 5 (of 6) because I just didn't feel i was learning very much, particularly about what the title of the course would suggest you'd be learning about.
We didn't cover enough advanced Excel functionalities, opting instead to focus on 2 statistical models (Binary Classification and Linear Regression).
There was also a bias to what each reviewer thought the capstone should cover so you had no idea which direction to update your work because the next reviewer may feel that the type of analysis you did was not Necessary.
The course needs a specific Rubric and specific methods each person has to use in order to complete the assignment.
Video lectures were repeats from those contents.
Hope this is constructive for both the lecturer and Coursera.
A _lot_ of concepts, words and specific tools are introduced, with not much opportunity to actually use them meaningfully and feel that one has actually learned a skill (as opposed to temporarily remembered the concepts for the quiz).
- Definitely.
The lecture videos were not engaging, and the jump from the lecture and quizzes to the programming assignments was quite significant (as others have pointed out).
interesting content but not well presented.
The professors speak in an extremely monotonous way, making it seem like they are reading their lines from behind the camera.
Second, sometimes I can be busy on weekends thus I want to finish the peer review earlier on Friday, however, there might often be not enough submission to be reviewed, thus I am very pressured to do this with a exhausted mind and body in the evening on Sundays.
If the missing material and content were up to date it would be a strong and complete course.
They should have been introduced one by one.
Not what I expected.
I had rated this course 4 star earlier but, I am downgrading it to 2 star now as the course managers - coursera + CBS seem to have abandoned the coursera while the program is still running and being charged upwards of hundreds of dollars.
The final peer assignment date has passed by close to 2 weeks and the grading process is not completed, neither there is any communication from course managers about the same.
Very disappointing from Coursera and CBS.
Also, either allowing the them to deliver the course material in their native languages with English subtitles, or perhaps having them record the course material in English in something similar to a classroom environment where they're accustomed to lecturing, would make things infinitely easier to follow.
This 'too many cooks in the kitchen' issue is what I also suspect happened with the week one quiz.
Hinton is basically just reading off the crowded slides.
If you know the basics, it is probably not a good use of your time.
I didn't like that the content feels like evangelism for (paid) google services, and most sources of the course are either random blogs or related to interested parties (google, twitter).
As a "free" course, it's still really valuable.
This course is neither high level nor low level.
The course was interesting, but I needed the certificate for my application to university.
I wish JavaScript's structure was more consistent with that of HTML and CSS.
Very basic course, I was able to complete the 4 weeks on content in a weekend.
Additionally, the written instructions for the final exam did not even cover some of the questions that needed to be answered i.
e.
Though if you are new to the topic, you may consider to take the course as it contains some useful information.
"Do these 21 things when editing a novel".
I would have liked the class to be less theoretical, with more frequent explanations linking concepts to practical applications in daily / business life, in order to keep interest and motivation high and facilitate understanding and memorisation.
Hard to understand subject.
It could have been MUCH better if he had used better presentation tools and shorter sentences.
You constantly need, like a housewife, put something for a chemical reaction (or start laundry, or put a cake in the oven), and then you have to wait for the chemical reaction to occur.
weeks 1,2 and 3 were not satisfactory according to me.
Useless Quiz and not enough Challenge CodingDatacamp or codeacademy do a better jobOnly for absolute beginners(Others please try something else, you will waste your time learning nothing)
idk its not what i expected.
Please make it more understandable.
Some of the lessons are disapointing of the lack of assistance to the required software/code to be used.
Only take this if you are either very fluent in math already or have a significant amount of time to devote to understanding the material.
I had to go to another online education source to teach myself R before I could do the Coursera programming assignments.
I'd like to have all the material in written format too so that i can come back to skim trough how some modal or tense works.
Carlos, the co instructor.
It places an unnecessary time burden on people who are taking this course not as full time student.
Nevertheless, thank you.
Each week was only about an hour.
Never before have I had to create so many fake accounts, nor write so many long and laborious manuscripts to be able to complete the assignments.
Each week, the duration of the lecture videos amount to somewhere between 120-150 minutes - and the lecturer didn't read slides; instead, he would explain the logic behind the concepts and provided papers for learners to read on our own time.
First, I would like to say that with the exception of ONE exam, I was able to take all the tests WITHOUT WATCHING THE VIDEOS.
You have to take a screencap video of your code and your app in action, upload the video, and then wait for another person to enroll in the course and review your submission.
More focus on practice use.
This course does go over some of the basics of graphic design, but I expected it to be a lot more rigorous.
I worked hard to be able to follow it, but if I knew how uninvolved the instructors were, I would have saved my money and spent it on a course with active involvement from those who developed it.
There is nothing wrong with an experience based / motivation-focused class, but that aspect needs to be transparent.
There just wasn't much to this class.
While this course seems to have potential, there are many aspects of it that don't result in a great learning experience.
I would not recommend this course to anyone.
Seriously we want to dive into the subject.
It's a shame.
More repetition here would be helpful.
While showing code in video lectures instructor was quick to delete code, not giving time for students to view and understand what had just been shown.
On Dec 15, two weeks before due date of final project, large portions of all weeks of the course were changed, requiring going back through to complete these new lectures.
Very few material, low quality assignments and grading.
I fail to see how it is relevant to learning the course and do not feel comfortable volunteering the amount of information many other people do.
Videos very dry and boring.
The lecture is too general.
Hopefully, this course can be revised to make it more exciting, interesting and engaging.
This class is an extreme example of an introduction to a subject - very basic information.
However, the most agonizing parts of this course is it requires tremendous of time to do self-study.
And the worst part is, it's difficult to schedule them, because you need to schedule not how long will something take, not in a linear fashion, but how long will multiple parallel things take.
More detailed explanation needed for newbies in Python and especially for newbies in programming, as it is , I am assuming, target group.
Some areas that I see this may be improved...1) Latest evidence based support (few articles/papers) on achievement and satisfaction (Success both parameters).
I asked clarifying questions about lecture material on the Discussion Forums and got no response (twice).
Several concepts were not taught with appropriate detail / explanation.
But I still want to have a try this time.
I had high hopes for this course, but I am quite disappointed.
Thank you for the offered class in any case.
I can only give this two stars at most.
The lecturers are just like reading the PPT without any heuristic teaching approaches.
The assignments make me desperate, always show very poor feedback message -- "Wrong answer", even the cases failed because of performance issue.
The starter files given from the assignment are inconsistent with the pdf description.
The speaker isn't very good, he speaks looking at his monitor all the time while he is reading the slides.
And I am saying that as someone that scored 100% on both assignments that I did stay to complete, so this is not a case of sour grapes, but an observation of inefficiency.
I understand that the class is based around "Active Learning", but for active learning to work and bear fruit, students should be able to engage with/analyze/synthesize/evaluate/build upon class content.
The part about home-cooking and how to reduce the health risks when cutting an onion where too superficial and unnecessary for me.
Sometimes I would change nothing between tests and get the previously marked incorrect answer correct.
Teaching material is fine.
Maybe in a longer course that would work, but here, I didn't even receive written feedback initially, so it would have been a mistake to wait for some to revise by before forging ahead.
If this class isn't going to provide a solid foundation to build on, then it should be made clear, upfront.
It wasn't well organized.
Full of mistakes.
There were also so many problems with this last and final Capstone project - delay in start date, plague of technical issues from Coursera, lack of support from teaching staff (and Coursera) when issues were experienced, and instructions that were not clear enough at times.
Professor is good and funny, and subject is interesting, but that's all.
That said, you have to sift through a lot of gimmicks to get to the parts of the lessons that actually matter.
Although, to gain confidence in your knowledge, this is a course that will require you to seek out additional materials to supplement your learning.
Compared to the previous modules in this specialisation, the lectures are dry, the presenter is not focused and slides are sometimes mixed up.
A few chapters such as cookies and session could had been skipped, even the prof. Muppala doesn't advice to use them, but as they're easy to teach so they're explained intead of more imporant things.
I'm getting crazy to do the most simple thing: a MEAN Stack Login.
So why is not explained the most usual thing here?
There was some really good advice, like the importance of being disciplined in sticking to the algorithm you have designed.
The assignment did not feel particularly relevant to the bulk of the course materials.
Presenter is reading the slides.
Even when I start, he does not clearly clarify how to start to use R. He was just talking about what the powerpoint shows.
Absolutely too perfunctory.
It would be better to make them sound more conversational (with pauses, questions etc.).
Platform tooling for emylators and native devices is tricky and if done wrong, it impacts a students ability to finish the course.
However these topics get very little attention.
When I took, assignments 2 and 4 were broken and there were no mentors to help students.
But the peer correcting is really bad, it takes tool long, some people are cheating and if you're unlucky you may not be corrected at all and fail the course
There is alot of advertisement for UBS in this course.
This means that you'll be left looking through a minefield of resources that include the code in the quiz question but are actually about something else.
I have now started using Lynda instead, and am seeing all the bad habits I've picked up and the holes left in my knowledge.
Presenter speaks too slow.
Compare this to the Aerial Robotics course where the quizzes took time and forced me to think and understand what was discussed in lecture.
The programming assignments were shockingly bad.
The lectures could use some serious editing too.
Enjoyable but limited content
The video lectures are really boring and useless
While the course's content is interesting and benefits a lot from Prof. Shiller's extensive scholarship and insight, it could be improved along several ways:(i) downloadable slides giving a comprehensive overview over Prof. Shiller's key points and power point slides;(ii) a split screen with Prof. Shiller on the right and the slide on the left side (like in Metrick and Geithner's "Global Financial Crisis" MOOC);(iii) clearer presentation and explanation, especially concerning Mr. Redleaf, but also for Prof. Shiller (he rambles quite a bit).
I feel the course, was very painstaking in terms of code reviewing other people's work.
If I were to break up the time I spent doing the course work, it would be as follows:30 % useful work70 % taking care of course logistics (code review, writing comments on every line of code just so that people being asked to review my work are happy).
The subject matter is of great interest to me but unfortunately Dr. Silverman standing paralyzed before a projected backdrop and lecturing in a monotone doesn't do it.
Further, my connection to the site is disturbing.
Sense of humour is off-putting.
Because of this, I may watch the lecture or just Google out the answer.
Great first starter but poorly done
I highly recommend either purchasing a book to learn on your own or take a class elsewhere.
Leaving this course.
I saved all transcripts and was unable to answer the questions.
It drills down on the multi-dimensional space that neural network is particularly good for.
Too simplistic and not enough real world examples.
I could have gotten a very good grade on this course, but the last assignment ruined that.
No matter how many web pages I tried to analyse and with how many different free tools I seemed to come up with the same 2 issues.....
if the page was performing badly (which was the type of page we were recommended to choose) there was not enough traffic to it to gather any information/demographics.
Pace is extremely slow.
Unfortunately, it did not.
It's not really useful for anyone older than high school student.
The assignments felt like they were pointless as well.
There's too much self-promotion (or maybe that's normal in the US).1 star because the final assignment gives a lot of insight, although it's on the long side.
The total session time for all 4 weeks together is only a few hours and the homeworks do not cover the session topics.
Good introduction to Bayesian concepts, but the course would benefit of some rethought of design of exercises.
No attempt is made to reinforce learned knowledge over time (e.
g.
Difficult to understand the professor, and slides were hard to read
This was not as high of a quality learning experience as the first course in the specialization, so I was quite disappointed.
However this is not his media.
Very theoretical and unstructured
I've kept it off easily for two years with a high fat/low carb eating plan.
Quizzes are trivial.
Unlike the very first course for beginners, there is a little bit more content here, so I put 2 stars.
I will try an alternative course!
The video quality could be better.
Do not recommend.
Pay to submit assignments, GG.
All the stars goes to the prof.
Most MOOC courses I've taken have at least 3 to 4 hours of content and learning.
This is the second course in the Full Stack series by Hong Kong University.
A lot of typos in the formulas of the last part of the guide.
Follow-up e-mails for many months after the course ends seem to start turning somewhat annoying.
lecture can be really unclear sometimes because lecturer breezes through the actual implementation of training/predicting: "use x, y, and z [underlines some stuff on screen]" and you're doneAlso lots of mistakes/typos in lecture and quizzes
I think it is a decent course to understand how the peer review process work.
Not the best class there is.
The course won't be useful for fitness\sports professionals.
Beginning would be more accurate.
Onscreen videos are bad enough, being at one remove from the classroom, but onscreen videos of an immobile monotone lecturers will kill any subject.
Had potential, but exercises and quizzes do not align with content taught by professor.
Overall okay course but the lectures are too focused on theory with some applications to the real world.
He spent 70% for introduction of each topic before reaching to the points that he want to make.
Quite boring, a lot of propaganda against drugs.
No concrete explanations of models.
(below 10 minutes/video), so lecturer separated it to more segment.
I I did appreciate the prompt that the assignments gave me to actually sit down and write, but so far the feedback wasn't very helpful.
Not worth the time and energy.
I often felt lost.
The course and presentations were very informational and good.
!I also took courses <Getting and Cleaning Data> and <Exploratory Data Analysis> at the same time and these two courses' assignments are much easier than the course <R Programming>.
Why wouldn't you do a simpler example in the drive-by assignment?
And still, I "dropped out" before the end of the course.
Office hours just seem like professor showing off all the places he goes to.
For me, this shows lack of professionalism and laziness- Some excel sheets are provided.
Beware.
I do not think an intermediate could easily grasp enough knowledge from the 4th week.
(I think; since I don't know what it is that I don't know, I am making a guess as to the missing piece of the puzzle.)
Could have been more practice than theory.
A little bit too light and not really challenging.
The course feels like the instructor is just reading off the presentations.
Overall, just an average course
The course is for an overview of many aspects of cybersecurity.
Very boring
Videos seemed disjointed.
I expected more practical exercises.
If you take this course, plan on spending a lot of time doing research on external sources in order to gain an understanding of the very broad and lacking in detail videos.
To improve this course, the instructors should:-provide links to at least one textbook on Swift-add Mentors to the course to help students in the forums-include a repository of code snippets for practice of the concepts
It's seems like they have been in a rush without decent preparation.
And there were times when the speaker was quiet or the microphone didn't work properly and I had a difficult time hearing what was being talked about.
Some quizzes miss important figures and explanations, so that they can only be solved with the help of other students that have access to previous versions of the course.
If this course should run for another session, the provider (University of Toronto) should decide on the proper audience and should also considerably revise the course.
Then had to go back and Review all the videos once they had been re-uploaded.
It's as if he neither thought about the structure of what he wanted to say or a script of what he might say prior to recoding the session.
This endeavours to teach some horrible practices.
Last, the large lesson assignment was only graded by peers with no feedback from the instructor.
Often times the quiz questions were either painfully easy or worded in such a way that was not verifiable in any of the class resources.
The pace is two slow.
I feel that this specialization is not focused enough on developing portfolio pieces.
Its a subtle form of style enforcement which I did not appreciate.
I really did not like the portion that went into detail about business analytics and related career paths.
I was unable to complete the second project (Badstore.
net), which requires a knowledge of html and SQL that is not taught in the course.
In my experience, many people did not even read the instructions on how to review the assignments.
Tries to summarize all the major topics but ends up delivering a totally disjointed, cut-and-paste experience with no real flow.
It is also not clear if the typed in answers are not read by the program correctly or if the answers do not match what the instructor is looking for, in any case the 3 weeks quiz is very difficult to figure out.
In comparison with other MOOCs I've participated in which have clearly been designed with online delivery and audience in mind, the format of this MOOC was not engaging.
This becomes especially striking for overlapping topics between the two courses.
Mismatch between assessment and course content.
The solution was a virtual sound card (I used Voice Meeter) where I could route the sounds accordingly so you could hear the sound produced by my DAW while I spoke.
I completely lost interest in it at that point.
I'm not sure which kind of audience this course is supposed for, but the style varies way too much.
Furthermore it's great that coursera is offering an iPad-app, but I'd like to be able to use and do everything that the app is offering me (and in the best case: everything that's necessary for the course).
I know what I need to be doing & I was hoping the course would inspire me to do it.
That's fine and probably necessary.
doing that would have enabled him to use his video time in a more creative way.-MOOCs are wonderful audio-visual opportunities but he had no slides or illustrations at all.
If I have to Google problems to complete step-by-step lessons, the lesson is extremely ill-prepared.
This is enough to make me abort this specialization.
Not good for people who would like to learn from basics.
incomplete and not clear.
The lectures are good, but in the assignments he asks for tasks that are not at all explained in the videos.
someone who not necessarily has a background in computational linguistics.
And what's worse, the narrator mispronounces "attribute".
From some of the posts from previous students on GitHub, they resorted to deriving the answer from another means (Excel?)
For those who work during regular business hours and use their free time on the weekends to study, this course becomes nearly impossible to complete.
nicely presented though, good quality videos.
I wish it had a more practical aspect.
Well explained videos, But very short course.
Interesting, bit not worthy of the invested money.
Perhaps the biggest issue that I found with this course was the disconnect between the material covered in the videos and that which was tested on the quizzes.
This is a 1 week course stretched out to 4 weeks.
For one thing it tries to cover far too much material in 4 weeks.
Just wasn't a fan of the videos: way too long and oftentimes unrelated to the course material.
Why does the teacher not take the example of the brilliant Aric Rindfeisch's course Marketing in the Digital World with really well-crafted practical assignments?
The instructors are very knowledgeable, but the course seems to have the , "we just threw this together at the last minute feel".
The material was interesting and up to date, but much was lost in translation.
Examples from the real world and a more graphic explanation esp.
I'm going to try to continue to the end but the first three weeks is probably 15 minutes of videos with the most annoying music available playing for way too much of the content.
Then, the section on Parmenides made me lose faith in the teacher - she presented his main ideas in such a way as to obscure his vision, which is of what we now call a multiverse, a world in which all things exist potentially.
I'd have much rather seen the concepts explained in more detail than rushing to add new modules without any context.
The quizzes are not challenging (the professor always puts the correct answer as the first choice) and the exercises just provide cut/paste code snippets without any reasoning or explanation.
It is recommended that students source out plenty of support material (intro to statistical inference and similar).
Coursework instructions were unclear (and had typos).
Poor quality.
There is no way to view other's bodies of work and critiques are very vague, etc.
but it does not depend on the mutation itself.
While course uses a genie method for presentation the content, Quizzes are just made to accomplish one goal: to make sure you have memorized every small detail haven said in the course.
Poor.
Because of this, given these are peer graded assignments, it is likely to lose marks because the peers interpreted the instructions differently.
"Which lectures are these, and where can they be found?- the only practical exercises in the course (Week 4) are only vaguely related to the course's targets-----All this being said, it is an ok introduction to the embedded OS world, if you bring your own CS and OS background knowledge.
Why do we have to do so many code reviews?
The lecturer for this course does have a pre-programming assignment on his GitHub repository to aid in the first programming assignment, but this was not easy to locate nor advertised well (had to scroll through discussion forums before I saw someone mention it).
The course on nutrition is just "ok" but the teacher has a very skewed idea about what "healthy cooking" really is and fails to present with reasons for her recipe choices.
Anyway I stopped watching the course, again, the nutritional part is fairly good but if you choose to continue the course at least make sure you keep searching for other points of view as well.
Best of luck.
The OOP portion of the final project was poorly constructed.
Again we can download the videos but when you are looking to fins something specific searching in 2-3 videos is not fun at all.
And for a course called "Science and Philosophy" there was far too much religious and/or anti-science content.
The week that discussed responsive design just talked about using bootstrap
Codes given are bug-ridden this in turn makes it incredibly difficult to follow on.
There is no barely any information about machine learning, except for a small Tensorflow playground overview and copy pasting Python to Datalab.
Sometimes the answer is obvious because the other answers are ridiculous, sometimes you don't know what to click, even though you just watched the video carefully.
I don't think is very credible to slice a course and offering it in 6 parts and call it a specialzation.
I wish you luck.
As far as grammar goes, it really only covers tenses and parallel agreement.
The Assignments are also not setup so that it is easy to fix your work.
The videos are just a (poorly) narrated glossary.
It would have been ok if the course had been free, but I expected much more from it for that price.
Thank you for you work, but, I think, you need to keep improving the quality of the course.
It could have been more in depth.
It is not.
There is almost no practical discussion.
A lot of stuff is just glossed over and not spent enough time on.
I also felt that the programming assignments were quite disjoint from the core, tough I don't feel like I understand the core better than before the course because none of the assignments made me think why something works, rather than that we just mechanically reproduced the examples shown in the lectures.
The Programming Assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience.
Navigating the course feels unintuitive and clunky.
I am a very frustrated learner trying to write a constructive review here.
Overall the course did not provide me with the value I was looking for.
I eventually just started reading the transcribed text of the lectures as I did not find looking at Prof Covach's talking head at all stimulating.
The two main presenters were very knowledgeable and it was pitched to an international audience.
I found the course pretty basic.
The content might be great but the teachers don't seem to enjoy presenting the course at all.
!
the projects are very hard and useless
Coming out from two very good predecessors (C3, parts 1&2), this course is somewhat a disappointment.
Perhaps show real data on how outlier transactions are spotted.
I'm not sure what audience Coursera is aiming for, but it doesn't seem to be anyone who doesn't already know a programming language.
The material was well delivered but I found it distracting to go between the video lecture and the additional material.
The course is fine, however its more an introduction than a course.
(This was as much time as I could afford to allocate to this course.
It's mixed from previous courses on Scala.
I enjoyed the videos, but not the assignments.
I learnt a bit about creating characters but I found the lessons bland and the assignments difficult to understand.
I have done other courses on the same topic which were better put together.
I am sorry, but this course is made by PR specialist, people that should know how to talk to the public.
Some teachers of this specialisation should been trained on how to behave in front of a camera.
The content is nice but you repeat too many time the same stuff, in a very neutral voice, so it is really hard to keep watching the course.
Thanks for sharing your knowledge, it is really helpful and rich, but as communication specialist, you can't just read a text, you have to live it.
The source is important when releasing a message !
The professor basically read everything.
I probably should wait to finish this course before reviewing, but I'm halfway through and have found my motivation gone--I'm finishing it just to finish it.
I was looking for more substantial examples of idealogical conflict I guess -stuff that is harder to resolve than being a person of integrity and making good decisions.
So basically it cuts off.
I think this course would have been perfect as primarily an intellectual course with a hands-on introduction towards the end.
A lot of quiz answers do not come from the video lectures.
Likewise, The grading system here is atrocious because of it; few people understand the foundation, and thusly don't know how to format or structure.
Expecting people to pay to update tech skills in unrealistic in todays competive environment when you are competing against other pla
Some of what I didn't like, others may like.
Great framework without a punchline.
Videos fine.
It taught smoothly and explained things well.
However, as others have mentioned some content (especially in early modules) could either be combined or ommited.
// I going to complete it because I'm stubborn that way, but it is an unpleasant experience for me and everyone within earshot as I have to vent my frustration often just to make it through.
Rather than wasting a couple hours listening to presentations, download the slides and read them yourself.
Removing all the fat each week would have 10 minutes worth of material.
Also I did not appreciate the length at which the speakers promoted their books.
Ideally, the real world example would be introduced in the first lesson in Week 1 and that data set would be used throughout the course(s) to apply and practice newly introduced functions.
thanks it just needs more time
Prof Aarabi is an award-winning professor at U of Toronto, but it turns out he knows little about iOS and has Jack Wu teach most of the material.
Didn't really cover how to deal with messy data, e.
g.
There are many things to improve in the next sessions.
(Week 6 is entirely spent on Precision and Recall, with only about 30 min of lecture.)
introductory course
Unaddressed questions in the discussion board required escalation.
I think the designers of the course wrongly assume that ALL R programming should be taught in THIS course which is erroneous; it should be about laying the foundations, on which the student can then expand his/her R programming abilities.
Name (not explain) those 5 things.
The material is useful, but the execution is poor.
But it was not very reciprocal.
The instructors approach in this course is very cursory.
concepts used are very old.
With all respect, Professor, if you are reading all our comments, I think you are a really smart person and you should take all the negative feedback from your students here, positively and constructively.
I do want to complete this Specialization, so I will try again perhaps after learning more - about statistics and R and who knows what else.
Learned about HTML ,CSS in initial classes.
It's ok to present a detailed schedule with a number of minutes for breaks; it's also ok to assume a certain mind set for "your manager".
There is little in the way of helping you understand these complicated concepts, and because they are complicated, many argue that should absolve the professor from needing to find a way to teach them in an understandable way (when other professors have been able to take complicated topics like this and distill it down to something that was both fun to learn and gave a solid foundation for going forward).
The contents of the course are interesting however it is a shame that you can only access the quiz portion and assesments if you pay for the certificate.
As an European I am more critic and I would like to see more quality, relevance and credibility of EU offerings.
And this is just one example.
The course need more improvements in terms of material, presentation and execution.
very fast
Very basic
The second video would be all about the history and logic and some of the applications we will be exploring without all the r formulas in the slides.
This is a small point and not a show stopper.
Overall - don't issue this course without major revisions (perhaps a new course team).
The lectures go through all manner of tools, commands, packages, etc.
If these really are "core concepts", as described by the mentors, one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases (which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources).
If you still need a self-help guide to actually start cooking your own food then by all means, take this course.
Sells too much Google and do not explain important things.
This Course is very easy to learn, all it's themes are so good explained.
I'm sorry but I might to change the RATE of this course.
All went well until the course started reading the explanation of code , after that ...
In fact, you would be completely missing on large chapters of statistics and, as a result, you would often end up drawing wrong conclusions and believe you did a great job.
Otherwise you can get a low grade on a great project because a Classmate thought you should have used another model so he gave you a 1 or 0 when the model you used demonstrated your knowledge.
Capstones need to be monitored either by a student or assistant to protect against trolls that don't read your work and give you the lowest score.
Just watching videos and doing quizzes is not a very effective form of learning.
I wonder if the purpose of assignments is to exam our reading and understanding abilities or the skills of R!!
It's about half of an introductory course.
Just no explanations of anything in this course.
not engaging- repetitions (videos in reading materials and in lecture) sometimes feeling that it is waste of time-quizz questions are hardly connected to lecturesdisappointed and discouraged.
They, as with the projects, I found to be a massive waste of my time.
I wish it had more "meat" and more exercises to develop the skills presented during the class.
Too much "talking head" (actually motionless body) and too few visuals of course material.
then it was loads of videos of other people drawing characters, not actually going through a design process.
But I find it boring, it didn't get my attention.
Required to use methods not covered in the course.
I'm agree with other people posting in forums about that.
Wasted time, could spend that month more productively.
Seems to be a marketing ploy for those on-screen more than to be anything of use to its audience.
I look forward to the other courses from this Specialisation for more in depth content.
Instead of speaking about Strategy - author goes into unrelated fields.
Unfortunately, multitasking is necessary in many environments, from office to home, and even a housewife has to multitask.
Questions such as "What did you find interesting about the video you just watched?"
So please slow down, speak.
Frankly I can't be bothered to look up sources for the descriptions of Roman soldiers' attire, and especially to figure what each number is pointing to.
Or from which latin word the term 'interest rate' derives?
there is no way to tell what error one has made - it could even be rounding.
If the material wasn't so useful, I would have rated this course 1/5.
I consider is a unique innovation in MOOC courses.
So, the course could be better given, provide more material and be better coordinated.
However some interesting and very concrete tips to learn
Gosh, I haven't heard this sound in maybe over five years...).
Sweet and short course.
Uninspiring and boring.
There is a long road to go after you finish this course, which makes me think the certificate is almost pointless and worthless.
It also uses things that are generally considered a bad practice (like using DOM event attributes in the HTML).
In consequence, the solution is always available.
In my opinion, it'd be better if a raw data set is given and you build the model step by step from the scratch.
It is a bit aweful that the insist on you using their libraries and programming environments.
Its not a joke but it is very difficult when the actual excel and model making isnt part of the lectures.
The final section about political considerations was very basic and only focused on the US.
Nothing really stands out about this course, and it was actually a bit boring and I don't feel I learned anything related to the subject.
I enrolled in November, but the course start date kept getting pushed back by a week or two at a time until it was ready 4 months later.
"Let's try and draw a very basic, simple apple."
You have to copy and paste.
Module 1 Final Quiz: questions aren’t worded well.
Mid-lecture question pop up in the middle of sentences and sometimes even words.
Quote from video 2.2.2: “Did you know that over 90% of candidates are now using mobile technology to look for jobs?” Then the practice quiz question “What percentage of job seekers use their mobile device to search for a job once a week or more?” and the correct answer is listed at “68%”.
I'd prefer a bit more passion and enthusiasm.
Way too much emphasis on BlueJ and Duke University specific libraries.
Hence the two stars as oppose to one.
If I'd wanted a curated list of tutorials so I could teach myself, I would have done that already.
Use of complex words in places where they were not necessary, complex structures, too fast language...
Also once the due date has passed sharing the best solution would help so as to give insights on what could have been done better.
The material was lacking (just static images, no real time coding), overall engagement for the courses was also lacking The instructor sounded low quality and sometimes a bit hard to understand.
In fact the course is fantastic.
This could be a great class if they get the bugs fixec.
This is a very simple, brief and useful course.
The modules are short, concise but do not go into lot of details.
The content is very basic, as would be for an introductory course, but can even serve as a refresher for CS graduates.
The only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 was because I did learn some Swift.
It is useful to begin with the topics, but it is really not more that a thin introduction.
Be specific about what is required (e.
g.
The course is good.
Very basic content, the content in this 5-week course accounts for similar volume as only one week in courses from other universities.
A pure misapprehension it was.
Peng is incomprehensible.
The majority of the course's mark (60%) is determined by fellow students using a rubric which leaves little true 'wiggle room' between pass and fail marks.
I found myself wanting to drop the course, and the discussion forums show I am not alone in my frustrations throughout the six weeks.
This could be a great course if it really taught to constantly think in terms of relational algebra.
Okay-ish explanations of databases and hadoop.
If you don't have a strong background in statistics , there is a good chance you will get lost at some point in the course.
And when there are more than 3-4 tasks like that, and they all have this "pick me up and start on me later" thing, they are all in your head and they take up all your memory and resources.
Then I tried to submit it offline which also failed.
Video editing for pre-recorded videos is not rocket science.
Assignments: These were the biggest frustration throughout the course.
Video is too short and spend a lot of time in the summary.
And on the another hand there are two much information and lectures for one week.
I liked that enough to enroll in the second class, however I did not realize that it was being taught by the same teacher.
Maybe it will convince you.
Not very useful, given the time and effort involved.
It seemed this course was a teaser to get people to enroll in/pay money to join the dogcognition program at Duke.
Say, more examples, better videos.
Social stare decisis has been a major stumbling-block not only for common-law countries but as well for countries that follow other sorts of jurisprudence.
The course was embarrassingly bad.
Clearly the target audience is a younger and newer Poet.
Please, change this course completely!
In multiple videos, there were typos.
I will absolutely not recommend this course if you are beginners.
The videos are quite informative, but if you don't catch on to the material based strictly on the videos, the weekly quizzes can be a bit frustrating.
Rather superficial, the poorest one of the modules so far.
You have to shoot at the end.
You can talk about a concept for 5 to 10 minutes but I still can’t get it.
In retrospect, I regret not starting to work on the final week's material right from the start, which resulted in having to switch session multiple times in order to finish the course.
This has been the most frustrating Coursera class I have taken, not because of the subject difficulty, but because of the lack of adequate resources for working with the models.
This is a very general overview of the topic but lacks depth.
The lecturer is clear, but there is a problem with the paste.
It is much too slow.
I have a technical background (heavy database, Data Warehouse, sql, and coding) and it was difficult for me, I can just imagine if you didn't have a technical background.
The assignments were not well supported by the lecture material, which were much to shallow.
Several times it feels like Mr. Campbell has never before seen the slides he is reading from and he is simply inventing stuff.
I feel like completing this class will require supplementation with better instruction.
In order for us the complete the first project, it required us to view Week 2 videos as well.
the course could/should be more detailed and a section of the course should relate to backyard chicken farming as well.
I want to learn more.
I truly believe in the idea of giving ambitious final projects, but I do not believe in the idea of giving the project that is by no means doable based on the course content.
It's a case of "chicken and egg", where if you understand the low level concepts you probably don't need the course, and if you don't understand them you also can't understand the high level concepts.- At the end of the Week 3 videos describing the three OSs, it is said "In order to know the details on how to write a program and run applications in Riot/Contiki/TinyOS, please come back to our lectures who have more detailed videos.
If the aforementioned is the case, the professor(s) should be commended for their efforts, but there is definitely more work to be done to make this an engaging course I'd recommend.
PS - I am taking notes and I have some experience with STATA so this type of coding/anaylsis is not unfamiliar to me.
I think a new set of courses should have been presented and not this.
Some concepts are dictated more than once because it uses videos made for this course + other recorded from a class room.
I think this course should be a 3 weeks project and the price should be the half of it cost.
Though I enjoyed the second project.
Also many questions are debatable, and there is no answers in the materials for the course.
Hope they will improve it.
It would be better if the instructor went deeper into the HTML5.
You need either give more information and examples or decrease the complexity of the questions and tasks
Could have more detail.
Also there are references to discussion forums that don't exist.
A big fail when you need the 2nd lesson in order to complete the 1st programming assignment.
).
I'm almost finished but am struggling to find motivation for it.
After having done the great "HTML, CSS and JavaScript" course, the contrast is hard to cope with.
If you already know it, it would help you refresh the mind.
Each week there are just few videos.
Teaching Staff is nowhere to be found.
I really wanted Amy Bloom to just walk over to the board and draw a character and say "this is a woman, she's divorced, she's middle class, she tends to get very angry when things don't go her way" or whatever,and then draw out a list of how her internal states might manifest in the world around her - she throws things, she's disorganized, she writes mean notes in the patient charts.
I wanted her to teach.
After about the first week the instructor was not heard from again on the forums.
too many information just to be said.
repeats or questions about particular reading frames when analyzing the ORFs.
Generally, seems to me the course was filmed in a hurry and wasn't delivered good enough for a rating above the basic fundamental two stars.
It all seems rushed and not rewarding.
I do not think that my outcome of this course has been significant because of the structure of the course and I regret that I have paid for all 3 courses.
Great Lectures, big content, high academic level But...
Lectures are deeply dull: all but 5 or 6 (on nearly 70) are long static videos of a lecturer speaking like he/she is reading, sometimes even robot-like speeches, no cacthy at all.
Sessions are based on Peer Evaluation, but often to find peers is a problem.
It would have better if the talking and coding was at the same time so that we can see its relative changes, which we can see in previous course.
Secy Geithner's focus in week 8 comes across as a personal defence of his actions rather an objective analysis of what was done and should have been done.
Not what I expected from this course.
Really wish there was an option for one-to-one mapping of the stanford course in its full rigor.
Xcode by comparison is very smooth and easy to use.
Lacking in content.
the lectures sometimes used to get very boring :-|
But the delivery is dull.
An However, interesting connection between the Internet of Things, and Augmented Reality.
His English grammar is bad.
We did barely any of this.
Specifics were not given.
In some way, I felt disappointed taking this course, because the quality is very poor in comparison to the other three courses of this specialization.
Lectures okay but syllabus lacked structure.
The lessons serves more as a guide to what you should search in google and learn through other source of information.
In my point of view the course overall is a bit superficial (even though the decision-making part was very interesting indeed).
really test anything about our understanding of our lesson.
I have no doubt teachers are excelent professionals in the area, as well as great machine learning enthusiasts.
There's also an enormous technical problem with the screen movie makers suggested (at least with the PC versions).
I expected insight and some level of instruction.
In one of the lectures, the Instructor literally says:"I'm not a big fan of some of the classic story structures, defining in what must happen in each act.
It seems to practice little of what it preaches in its design and pedagogy.
The test would mark my answers wrong for no reason.
I've been following along using Python 3 code myself, but it's 2017, and Python 2 reaches End of Life in 3 years at 2020.
The assignments are very lengthy and the grading doesn't always conform to what would be intuitive.
Some gems used in the course material are also old versions.
The course looks a lot like advertisement of a textbook.
The extra star goes for stressing the importance of accessibility.
To sum up: decoration largely outweighs structure.
A stark contrast to the abundance of support provided and material covered in aerial robotics.
Also, I think the fees is high for such trivial concepts.
Only 1 or 2 (short) videos per week!
Poor presentation.
This courses touches many interesing aspects about R programming but I did not like the structure , it does not seem to me that it adequates its difficulty coming from "The R programming enviornment".
Also I miss some swirl lessons for many of the readings from the book.
I wasted hours trying to work out why it was marking my answer wrong.
The lectures by the TAs are delivered in a "robotic" tone if you'll pardon the pun.
However it's pretty damning when he manages to to be so off-putting to so many of the students, going on the discussion comments.
In general Algorithm course, it is usually taught late.
On the other hand, if you are looking for a heavy Cybersecurity related course I suggest you to stay away from this one, unless you are taking the specialization in which case you don't have other choice.
Content: 2.5/5Videos Quality: 1/5Practice/Theory ratio: 1/5
Would not recommend.
In the last video, there is a mention to the business world and how to apply this savoir relier approach, but in contrast the videos and examples show as examples a situation extreme with an avalanche, use the HEC MBA program as example.
I did not found this course much useful.
It does not fully utilize the power and possibilities of a MOOC (students cannot study at their own pace, there is no live interaction, standard quizes and assignments), which is a bit ironic.
Peer-reviewing really brings down the quality of the feedback.
The effort to make the class more engaging ironically only distracts from the course material.
Feels like you're just going through the motions and copy and pasting code.
Very, very, very basic intro.
This course may be misleading aspiring data analysts and scientists: it may give the false impression that, with the tools learned here, you will be able to analyze your data by yourself.
If you take the pace suggested in the course, you're likely to have bought a new computer before you can program anything extremely useful.
There were many errors in subtitles.
I know what he meant- that the success of the organism is served by the results of gene mutation - but evolution is a RANDOM event.
Wasn't opportunity for enough feedback and explanation.
The first lessons start with diagrams that are not explained and terms that are not defined (which I presume were probably covered in the first course).
The video is simple and good.
But the final project and some test are too hard based on material presented.
Also staff's support are not good.
In comparison to the Duke course, it was way too shallow.
It's length was misleading -- I completed the work in two days easily, but I am a technologist, and already had the tools installed.
The course presents two core approaches to parallel programming - task and data parallelism.
Okay course.
Also they didnt gave any techniques or tips how to easier create game worlds
Sorry, but of no real use except to people totally
Very basic stuff
I expected much more.
The only good aspect from this course are the assignment checkers, which allow you to write your solutions in multiple languages.
I deeply regret the money and time I spent on this course.
Constants errors in explanations, made you work very hard to complete it.
The lectures are too slow and repetitive too.
I'd encourage the course instructors to take a look at the University of Washington's Machine Learning class.
The professors know what they are doing but not good at making the concepts plain to the students who don't have the strong background.
That is not deep learning, it just shows you how well deep learning can work.
Graphlab is a mature framework, I guess, but it's commercial and scikit-learn is better imho (and free!
It would be useful for parents and learners who are new to disability issues.
The instructor often verbally discusses the statistical formula with a few bullets on a slide with the focus on himself.
Too many irrelevant questions.
All in all, it seems you applied one of the rules you discuss in this course: release fast, and adjust later on based on customers' feedback.. Unsure this is the right approach when it comes to online learning.
Grades assigned by fellow classmates are very subjective and sometimes miss the points made it the material.3.
Especially during assignment 4 where everything needed to be hosted in the server in order to work; this made is extremely difficult to review.
Sorry, I didn't like it.
For the most part of the course, it felt like the instructor was just "reading" the teleprompter without blinking for several seconds!
However, the level programming assignments in this course is between slightly medium and very hard.
Furthermore, the assignment instructions are not clear enough, i.
e.
The code for the final assignment is peer reviewed which doesn't make sense.
However, how I structure my code and how many comments I write are entirely my choice.
Now, while I understand that the course material itself does not ask you to structure code one way or another; the review guidelines that are being given to some very inexperienced programmers, makes them believe that this is the only way things should be done.
The contect of some modules of this course is very light and the multichoice tests at the end insultingly easy.
Not a courser for beginners.
Unfortunately some of the chapters (especially deep learning) are so brief that it is really frustrating trying to complete the quiz and assignment.
On one hand it goes way beyond the simplicity of the lenght of the course, assume a mindset that extends well beyond this course, and on the other hand after doing the quizzes some times and observing the considered right and wrong answers, some of them - to say the least, are highly ambiguous and express a personal point of view of the instructor in what is right or wrong (what by itself is not very reasonable), and lack ultimately in objectivity regarding the materials covered.
I was going to take the CSS3 course from the series, but now I plan on looking for this education elsewhere.
Not very substantive.
A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics, but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums.
Platitudes and generalizations.
This course is just definitions.
The homework assignments all required information that wasn't covered in the lectures, forcing hours of searching for answers.
I found myself having to watch some portions of the videos over and over again in order to understand what was being said.
Very basic, no new material or ideas if you've been interested in the subject for a while, but it might give you a fresh perspective on how to present some subjects to your audience.
Maybe she was trying to be professional?
For example, the increasingly crucial role of marketing automation platforms like HubSpot, Dynamics Marketing and Marketo and how CRMs like SalesForce and Dynamics are driving both marketing and sales strategy.
very elementary.
Whilst I have some basic programming experience I am by no means an expert.
I'm also failing to see how much of this is going to be applicable to future installments of this course.
The assignments in particular seemed trivial, and were compromised even further due to some technical problems with the simulator recommended for students without access to actual hardware.
This course would be a good candidate for revision, with a focus on gradually increasing the depth and complexity from stage to stage, and on commonly-used components such as current amplifiers and shift registers.
However, it does not really help to write a paper.
Almost totally ignores the ancients.
Overall, I felt like I learned to follow a few basic things about Unity, nothing more.
The course is good but it could be improved.
Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization, it's a bit of a bait-and-switch.
We watched a series of author fireside chats, and then people bumbled through the assignment.
Worse, the answers often required equations and LaTex math was not available.
While the lectures were good, one of the mentors wasn't profesional at all, she was nasty, though the other one was very fine.
But my chief complaint is the terrible method (in creative writing classes only ?)
Such a shame as I'm sure the writers really know their material and conveyed so well when the content was there.
The course is a bit of a show.
Most videos are shorter than 10 minutes, the instructors race through their bullet points without developing the ideas enough.
I would not have asked my work to pay for the specialization if I knew it would take me 3 months to complete R Programming.
Very easy course, but you won't learn a lot.
The quizzes predominantly asked for verbatim recitation of the substance-free lectures.
other than that it is ok .
For example, it is unclear which model you need to use to calculate in order to get the correct square foot.
The videos do not adequately prepare the students of the programming assignments.
The instructor should provide more support regarding the homework.
You protest "But I have no clue of how to PLAY", but your teacher says "All the piano greats learned by fiddling around with a "hacker" mentality".
This course is not for me.
Principal concepts seem very difficult from the first lesson.
Professor hesitates, quiz is incomprehensible.
So, Good Bye !
No thanks, Coursera.
As when we are interested, for sure we will go and do more research, and some might even would like to move on to intermediate or advance levels.
The key point here is "speak to the level of your audience".
Not very engaging.
(In addition to greater incorporation and emphasis on the written materials, I think more real-life examples of diplomatic successes and failures would be a far more effective and entertaining use of the lecture time than the esoteric philosophising that seems to characterize it in this edition.)
I will take other classes on programming and then come back to this one again later (maybe).
I still don't have a grade and need help!
This course is only supported by a course of data analytics.
However even when I chose a popular page I was unable to obtain the requested information because it was not my website so I was not entitled to view this information - again returning zero results.
the material are great so much information and it is the first from the hole specializationbut!
Cyber Security is miniscule in the topic.
I also thought explanation is unnecessarily hard to understand.
The content is dated and not well though through, and it feels like the whole thing could have been put into 2-3 courses
It might be a great choice if you are already familiar with Swift programming!
I had many problems with the final two programming assignments with running Spark in the VM and there isn't a lot of help available online.
It's something.
I wanted this course to focus specifically on strategies for engaging young readers, but it did not.
You could watch all of the videos in 30 min probably.
If you are a beginner I would suggest trying 'Python for the absolute beginner' by Michael Dawson.
This one course covers more information that the rest of the courses combined..
Too bad for the rest of the course, which I was looking forward to a lot.
It's clear that Ultimaker is the sponsor, but it felt like a commercial.
Could have been covered in full in a ten minute video.
IE could done more.
Need clearer examples and explanations.
I did some coding for week 3 but that was it.
The content is good but the delivery is not engaging or creative enough.
Highly questionable this approach.
During several periods, over multiple sessions of the course, the third party site went down and was unavailable for as long as 48 hours at a time; during which it was impossible to properly run or debug the assignment due to its requirement.
What the assignment is asking for isn't even terribly difficult when you do understand what is required, and the code is rather simple and minimal to implement.
This is ok if you know absolutely nothing about nutrition.
the content is simple, I think the course is just for watching during the break.
Severance does a great job explaining some of the basics of python in a short amount of time, but this course needs to be restructured.
The content is more suited to this specialization context instead of teaching excel in general so in case you are looking to learn excel, this is not a great course.
too easy
The result is a class that feels more like "Writing: How to Make a Formulaic, Sellable Book" than anything with "Creative" in the title.
I am really looking forward the next courses in the specialization since I really need a good course in statistics and this seems to be one, but the first course should be eliminated.
The instructor is very boring and does not explain very clearly.
No quizzes.
The latter, especially is inexcusable.
This course is too basic and superficial.
Mostly just common sense.
But, great professor!
Despite having high quality contents, the quantity wasn't as much as I expected.
The name of this course is misleading to me (and if it's misunderstood by one, you can assume there are other people affected as well) - it would be more clear what's expecting you if the course would be called something similar to the last assignment name "Creating a data-driven website".
The responsive part that I was interested in, was basically done with "use bootstrap" - that's pretty poor.
I am looking for courses where there is hands on development that you follow with the instructor and I did not find this here.
With a designer background, I could never accomplish this course.
All past discussions on the forum are gone, making it difficult to review posts by classmates.
Good content, but blocked quizes in free version is bad idea.
At most, you would have written a workable example for solving a certain kind of equation, but I doubt you'd be anywhere near proficient after being hand-held through one example.
On the positive side, I was exposed to many different things in the web-development world -- that I cannot argue against.
Another blatant colleague marketing technique occurred during the course of one of the required videos wherein the organizer interviewed an author about his book.
This is not an introduction to R programming... this is more in-depth than just introduction... in week 2 we're asked to compute and program to read multiple files at once with very specific functionalities!...
The first Quiz had almost nothing covered in the video lectures.
I expected better quality from a course provided through Duke University.
It often felt as though the lectures didn't matter at all.
I was a little bit dissapointed with this course because, in my opinion, it is not structured well, it is just an amount of questions we need to think about.
I have never seen anything like that and again - it most certainly wasn't covered in the lectures.
Very superficial and too few insights.
The content and the speed that they teach you R are actually good.
I would merge this class within R-Programming section and call it Part 2 rather than categorizing into "Exploratory Data Analysis".
For those just interested in learning Spark or Mongo and not doing the certificate program you can probably get better learning from doing your own research.
Interesting material, and good assignments.
There was some good, thoughtful feedback and some was nonsense.
Too many generalities and roundabouts and little real detail.
Therefore, I have to wait 7 more hours before selecting an incorrect answer to complete the course.
I'm disappointed.
To make this review constructive, my recommendations:1- Pay attention to quality.
It's so disappointing.
More importantly, the course lacks one of the richest tools in MOOCS: peer interactions - people voicing their opinions and sharing experiences.
Besides that: some of the questions in the quiz looked very ambiguous and there are some editing mistakes in the videos.
i like it but there is ALOT to do i am 13 taking this for science class and i am starting to get lost in what the are saying
Boring if you have ever programmed before.
There is zero support from staff in the forums.
I already knew everything taught in this course and was a bit annoyed I had to pay for this in order to complete the track.
All these areas should have been expanded, and the course should have had more arguments as well.
Finally, the assignments are not enough and their grading system is quite poor: instead of submitting your code and testing it automatically, you should calculate some quantities by hand and select the results out of a few possibilities.
All in all, I was disappointed with the course.
Without it, this might as well be nothing more than a series of YouTube videos.
Had Coursera not discontinued the discussion forums, I'd have given this course four or five stars.
Quizes impossible to understand unless you take previous courses and have time to go through forums and more extra staff.
Too US focused.
While a lot of useful ground was covered, it was a constant struggle simply getting my environment to work properly - the entire specialisation needs to do a better job of getting users on a level playing field with better environment setup.
The instructions to peer-reviewed assignments are not clear and will not bring you to the correct result which is shown during peer review.
I've paid for course and unable to ask questions.
Changed my mind after watching the cooking.
Come on!
The SQL assignment followed a set of lectures in which no proper discussion of SQL was ever given.
The editor is faulty and on the submission on visualization you cannot use visualizations(!)
No involvement from the faculty, no one to answer questions.
I expected much more detailed and deeper knowledge from the course.
The content of the course was actually very helpful, but the way the assignments are made took all my motivation away.
Stating, again as if it were a given, that deficit spending is naturally the right answer to a crisis.
A disappointing experience.
The lectures are very basic, thought for people that have no experience in programming.
I had higher expectations vs. Mines Telecom.
If the majority of course is spent on googling, what's the point to take it?
I wish this was noted/told to the students in the course.
Where was the real life experience?
Financial accounting is awesome.
It's like you are teaching college stuff to 8th graders.
Here are the 5 things we covered"I think there's a lot of potential for this course in the long run.
No Feedback from quizes, it doesn't even show you what you have answered, makes it very tedious to study the material.
IoT as well is supporting product marketing.
Between the book plugs,and the seemingly partisan descriptions of later Presidents,the course goes from a factual overview,to a meandering book pitch
I left the course after week 3 because I couldn't tolerate the accents of the instructors.
Furthermore, the galaxy instance was crashing regularly, making the convenient batch tool impossible to use.
While I liked the idea of grading each other, it was too much work, as everybody got different answers, because of too hard questions.
I really liked the Python For Everyone Course so I thought I would like this one as well, but it was not done to the same standard.
they should improve their javascript course .
I had to force myself to concentrate at times and search other sources for more detailed insight.
So, it needs time for me to find the way or solution in the discussion forum.
"Others may experience this course differently depending on your goals.
In the homework I spent more time wrestling with commands in R than actually gaining an understanding of the subject matter.
Also, I really didn't need so many subject matter examples about the professor's baby's pooping habits.
As a result this is a pretty bland and boring 4 weeks.
It is generally good course, but I feel it is just a combination of very little tools, skills and ideas.
First time little disappointment by coursera.
com
Sorry folks but we are not learning much here
Difficult to follow.
I found this very frustrating.
The materials are pretty sparse and there is not much structure.
All four weeks are available at the onset of the class and the entire class can be completed in a weekend.
While I was able to follow the lectures, the material is very introductory and I was hoping to learn more.
I wanted to know how to make web-pages, I didn't get that information from this course.
I had high expectations for this one but it was the only one I have been disappointed in.
I tried to complete quiz 4 nine times and eventually passed the deadline.
Also the course doesn't use open source tools but a trial version of a pretty expensive library.
If you are interested in learning R, I would recommend going to DataCamp and starting there.
Let me put it this way: in my previous university studies, I have never taken a multiple choice quiz where the question starts as 'In your opinion...'Sadly, I will probably drop this class - but the course has sparked enough of an interest where I will probably be picking up some books or doing some informal research on my own about this topic.
is it average number of buses that come every hour?
I did not like this course.
The lack of teacher or teaching assistant participation in the forum discussions is deafening.
It roughly covers some concepts of data science, but never at scale, and never very clearly.
Other courses had more videos.
Very hard to pass the quizes, as there are no analogies or examples in the videos - just theory.
Introduced too many tools in a single course.
Techniques and content are a bit too traditional.
I already have had enough knowledge, but as there is no support by the team it seems to be rather time consuming for others.
If you want to learn how to actually DO computational investing, do not take this course - its just not serious enough.
As the name of this course implies, you probably expected to find part II somewhere, which was promised to be a course about using machine learning in investing.
The instructor is not good and doesn't explain things clearly.
The assignments themselves inherit the nice modular spec-test driven spirit of the first two classes.
I think the content itself is somewhat too theoretical, it does not usually apply to the reality
You know, few classmates.
Not a technical skill or ne
There are two frustrations with this iteration of the series.
I studied several courses online in the Coursera Community, and this course was the first course for me which instructors and mentors did not reply to the questions in the forums.
Very good for newbies in the field.
So, my score is "2".
It was just really, really hard to get through.
The tests were also poorly designed.
At some point this course appeared like an advertisement for the institute and its research work3.
The final project was ridiculously far more difficult than what had been covered in the class.
The lessons go too fast.
Lexalytics isn't available for a Mac, so I couldn't even use it.
Everything is already said in last courses in this specialization.
There are a lot better Courses on Entrepreneurship on Coursera.
As such, my review might look scathing and I'll detail why in a minute, but I want you to know that this course is quite possibly invaluable when it comes to web development.
Free courses on iTunesU (especially those by Stanford University) are far more better.
Condescending, not backed up with evidence and preachy.
I did not learn a lot.
The lectures themselves are just a series of cases of some R functions usage with no basics of Why you need to clean the data or real cases with complete examples how and where to get your data and what steps you can do to make it useful.
The course has a lot of links for tutorials in R. That's a plus.
You have the right answer but you'll need to waist hours to produce specific string for your grader to be satisfied.
This i not an elegant learning process at all.
difficult for beginners
The quizzes and assignments do not align with what is taught in the lessons.
I can pause and go back again which is always nice but the info still doesn't stick.
Some of the "correct" answers are personal opinions but you have to choose them in order to pass the quiz.
The third peer grading assessment asks students to post a video either to pitch himself/herself or to pitch the game the student makes.
I am pretty good in English, but had to stop video and to google translate some "smart" words lecturer used without particular need - I don`t mean definitions, just some epithets to make his speech "smarter".
The materials were good and I can use some of the ideas straight after the lectures in my everyday coding, but the assignments were really slightly related to the topic.
Barnes Hut simulation assignment.
Good intent but poor execution.
the explanation is so weak doesn't match at all with this big datathe pseudocode is so distracting and hard to readi always get lost and i don't know is it an array in the code or variable and what does he want to do with itthe pseudocode should be just a normal english code saying what to donot an understandable signs :\i am really sad that i couldn't get benefits from this amount of knowledge
This is surprising - there are lots of practical tools discussed in the course, and you have no opportunity to get hands on at least one of them (except Google Trends) and evaluate it, at least for primitive purposes.
This was inferior to the first installment, which had a great many problems on its own.
While I appreciate this class for attempting to tackle a complicated topic, it was too hard for me to follow, and the peer assignment grading rubric is too arbitrary.
Although I liked the topic, I will not be taking more classes with this instructor.
The second lecturer is disappointing.....
There should have been more explanation and videos in week 1...
not very interesting.
I have dropped the course and will just read the book.
There are many resources to read, videos that briefly discuss concepts of the week.
The videos added NOTHING to my understanding.
Otherwise the course ends up being a flaky tap-dance on the surface of the material.
It is somehow just an extension on R Programming course, with many unnecessary details that will be forgotten in a few days after the course.
The project itself is very time consuming with lots of self learning and unclear specifications.
Machine learning is too simplified and spark part is not even explained, also very little relation of all course with Big Data.
This will allow more time to delve into the forward and backward propagation which should have been explained in more details.
Very general short and sloppy explanations and a lot of practical assignments for peer evaluation.
Good course!
I realized this in week 2 and did not continue the course.
I have no problem paying for a good product.
I was quite disappointed in the capstone; I have not found the quality of the questions to be very high, and more than once there has been a disconnect between the question asked and how the reviewer is asked to grade it.
The material which is given is not enough , I think the course is good in general but it should focus in building the knowledge more instead of leaving many things on the air and going through the material as if it were a quick review.
Not sure how this course is usefull.
In my opinion, the course title is not suitable, which is "introduction".
The part about passive tenses is only about one tense Past Simple.
I am rating this after taking the 'Regression Models' course and in that course it is MUCH easier because he gives "real time" and visual examples of what, eg Residuals, mean or represent.
Often there's a new attempt of Andrew Ng to say something without even cutting out the first attempt.
Very basic introduction to Data Science.
I looked at the biostats course by the same guy.
This is a very basic course and should state that in the description.
Course lectures don't seem to match up with the questions on the quiz.
One of the instructors even said at one point they didn't have enough time.
Very disappointed with this final course.
Using MOOC 2, I was really hoping we would go more in depth on (free) tools like Google Analytics.
Also the lectures have a lot of errors that were not corrected in a professional way.
Assignments are weak but as a whole for the four courses making up the Capstone just grit your teeth and get through it, the least enjoyable and instructive of all four.
bad explanations, nothing you can do at exams without researching from external sources.
It was as if there was a major piece missing in this course.
I would like to believe that on a UI course people would have come up with a better and more intuitive set-up.
This course has a lot of potential, but in its current format and content it was a disappointment.
I find this to be very very basic advice on how to write a scientific paper.
This course (as the previous one) needs some improvements.
but as java script starts this course becomes a headache , not because javascript is difficult but they made it difficult .
Rarely did I see any of the mentors participating in the group discussions even though there were plenty of questions.
However, if you are a college student like me, you properly will not be able to commit that much time.
I normally struggle to give poor reviews to free online content, but there are so many glaring fundamental issues with the presentation and content of this course, that it I feel it's important to warn people not to waste their time with this course in it's current form.
The mapping and planning lectures raise some good points, but the rest give only the most basic overview of the topic at hand, glossing over steps enough that you would probably learn just as much watching youtube, or looking around inside wordpress on your own.
JavaScript by nature is much more complicated than HTML5 and CSS3, and therefore I believe that it should be done in a bit more than 4 weeks, and broken down in to smaller bits of the basic info required to get a grasp on the materials.
But the lectures should be more practical (not just the bullet points of the book), and the weekly assignment should not be a chapter summary question.
very bad course but i have come to the point that it is ok for the beginers
How do you develop a plan to build a tidy data set (i.
e.
But this negative comment is only because I was expecting it to be a bit more comprehensive, for someone who has no previous information about any of the subjects, this can be a good introduction.
Assignment instructions are not as clear as they could be.
Without feedback, it was difficult to know which one you missed.
These two stars go to the instructor in week 1.
Disappointing, not different from a class presentation, poor in content, lousy instructor
Evaluation seems to be based solely on peer review and there are no model solutions available, so the points you'll get may vary depending on how your peers understood the assignment and if they were interested in the review process at all.
My overall feeling is that nothing was quite challenging on the course, and I didn't learn much more than what I could have learnt by reading a few paragraphs per topic from Wikipedia.
It's very very basic information about research.
Ideally the speaker should focus on detailing the points highlighted in the slides but in this course the speaker is just passing on the same information which are there on slides without adding much value.
He does not explain things well, and articulate examples.
Few useful information.
It was the assignment equivalent of stopping in the 7-11 a block away from a birthday party to buy a card.
Also, in terms of delivering the content: Mr. Caffo needs to structure his slide/video arrangements so that he is not standing in front of the text.
I also feel that the topics discussed could be examined in further detail and at a slower pace.
Very easy.
this was my least favorite of the classes - the lectures ere not informative, and far too lofty.
I apologize if that sounded rude, but try listening to the lectures with headphones and you'll say the same.
This prototype must show the game mechanics and aesthetics, should be playable… And can be non digital?
Course content feels upside down.
The guest speaker uses unnecessarily weird examples in his talk.
It could be much better if its depth could be made higher.
All the actual algorithms were supplied in a separate module.
I had a terrible time deciphering the lecturer's English and, because I'm not interested in a course certificate, the course projects were a waste of my time, though I can see that they could be fun and add to the enjoyment of the course.
The course touches the topic very lightly.
I wanted something that would be practical and adaptable to the ideas that I'm working on.
And don't even get me started on the final...
This is not a course for a beginner in programming.
1 to 2 more weeks would have been expected from this course.
It might have been OK if they had an intro to OOP that was a prereq for both of these courses
In fact, there's not much presented that really benefits from the video format.
Learning materials are poorly delivered.
For me, if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas, I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn; but now, it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly.
However, it is way too brief for the amount of material covered.
The class could stand to be restructured: for example, it would have been nice for the lectures to cover the str() function before our first programming assignment.
Not enough to justify the increasing frustration I was feeling toward the end of this course.
I got frustrated starting from week 2 where I have to reread the subtitles to understand the material.
The instructors were not very engaging.
However, I am now told they will be fixing the course.
This is not the same as "balance," which would entail each side laying out its key points and evidence.
Would have liked to learn a lot more about how to determine what KPIs you should be measuring in different businesses, what kinds of metrics are important, etc.
Otherwise, I might just throw a class up on coursera, give the link to docs.
python.
org, tell the students to read it and then they will be experts at python.
Some exercises are an hour long for something that won't be quizzed in the end.
Understanding that this review was made about a new course that covers something rapidly changing and not persistent, I still did learn a lot of valuable things and I would recommend this course to everyone involved in web development.
This course gives introduction of plenty of artworks from MoMA, but it will be more interesting if it shows more details and explanations about the artwork itself or the background of the time and the society.
Seems like tutors have not spent time on proper preparation.
Made it very difficult to follow.
The content was really neat and definitely not something I had been exposed to before.
I did not learn so much from the videos but by myself.
That's depressing since my purpose is to watch the video and check out what I learned so far without getting any certificate.
This is the worst course so far.
It's really hard to follow this course without previous background in iOS development, despite it's called "Introduction To Swift Programming".
For example how does it help the learner to be able to answer, what question the shirt of the presenter has?
I think it's just to theoretical here.
Sorry again, but it's my opinion.
The quizzes, however, are so frustrating as to lower the enjoyment of the whole thing.
I dropped on Week 5.
I'd say that is perfect, but it is not because requires payment to be assessment in the activities.
Interesting content, but issues with broken links needed to complete quizzes while they were due.
Horrible autograder - very stiff and all results must be in a very strict order and format.
While it teaches the basic syntactic rules well enough, the functionality of R is explored in an ad hoc manner where the assignments have little to no relation to the week's lecture.
It's worth following this course for free but definately not your money, the free course on futurelearn had ten times more content and I learned so much more...
This course was difficult to follow and the free trials offered seemed forced upon us.
Can't even do the quiz without payment!
I'd like much more the first 2 courses.
Rarely straying from the slides, the times the presenters go into more depth on a concept, you get a scribble in the corner of a slide, lacking the clarity I've come to expect when approaching complex concepts from master educators like YouTuber PatrickJMT or Khan Academy.
The class covered a good variety of subjects to learn.
tutor is Russian i guess her accent is not quite understandable
Anyone could do that job, and they should have chosen more of an "news anchor" type of person with better pronunciation and more flow.
Excellent course with great content but I have issues with the evaluation process when peers and staff do not participate in the advertised methods of communicating their concerns with my work!
Not sure if that's just a Coursera thing though.
Overall I would recommend you to have a solid background before proceed with this course if you want to improve your learning experiences.
Somehow simple presentations.
Finally, the "putting it all together" section is vital for anyone who wants to work in digital marketing, but the coverage here was much too general.
As having good knowledge will never be equals to able to produce good students.
I tried reading the transcripts instead, but the they’re even worse!
Not enough conversation on IoT (Just in the last module).
The ask in the fist assignment was not formulated correctly.
The support by the mentors could be much better.
While some of the materials are interesting in this course, it gives a very "high school" feel rather than providing help with college essay writing.
Explaining the type system, the prototype chain concepts, making us aware of what the language can and can not do.
The capstone project should have been little more challenging and something new.
I have completed the third week, but quizes are too big, and the questions are almost impossible to compare with the lectures.
It seems like what is evaluated is your ability of getting languages nuances, and not the epidemiology subject.
This course was a very disappointing experience since it is designed around depending on peer reviewed assignments that don't get graded.
The mathematics in this course are at a high level (similar to Statistical Inference) - and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field.
This course has valuable information, but it is ultimately political.
In some assignment, I had to edited a file which I was not supposed to edit in order to pass it.3.
Now if i wanted to recap something, i had to guess the video, and then watch it just to notice it wasn't the right one.
It might be useful to someone who does not know anything about it at all.
While it is a great course for all beginners to the Guitar, the only problem that I see is the grading system that is absolute loony.
Hunh?
The assignments were nearly impossible without help from other students.
Activity on the forum compensates that.
There were no responses to student questions nor concerns that were raised about typos and possible errors in the quizzes and problem assignments.
I will do the project to complete the course but was very disappointed in my first course through Coursera.
Also, the teaching style isn't very engaging either.
She had a frown the entire time.
I would have benefited from another application assignment that was a stepping stone to the full-blown audit.
However, presented info is often vague and generalized, some sections discuss very little scientific data to back up claims made, and course is generally not very rigorous or challenging.
Overall, this course is tough for me.
For an instructor from the University of Michigan whose bio says "I work with colleagues to design tools to better the teaching and learning experience in higher education," I was expecting a lot more value for the time spent in this class.
I like that the course covered negotiation in general in relatively short time.
How about a 53 (yes, that is fifty three!)
I was disappointed by this course.
This is not what I was looking for.
Yonsei presents very short courses, as it can be seen in the specialization emerging technologies.
It is kind of bias to apply NLP knowledge and develop data product in the capstone project.
One has to depend entirely on reading materials to understand the course.
I learned a lot, but this was not very engaging.
It didn't explain technical IT architectures of IoT.
Learning the correct html tag syntax is not intuitive--one has to be shown examples.
Reading a good number of submissions from members of the course, I didn't feel that this course gave them the practical skills needed for good prose, but w
Most of the course consists of slide decks to read.
Users now expect nothing less than presenters with exceptional communication/teaching ability.
In most videos the presenters read verbatim from the slides and motion with their hands to explain concepts that would be better broken down on a whiteboard.
Week 3 and 4 lectures are robotic - Most material taken directly from the internet.
Reading the dissertation before doing the course would probably help understand the formulae they say out of context without the proper explanations.
I should point out I am bilingual so this was by no means a language issue.
I would have preferred to have the exercises conducted by providing a high level goal and then a solution to check against rather than the "put this code here" approach that's used.
Very dry and uninspired.
The lecturer monotonically reads off some material.
The explanations don't usually make any sense.
The quizzes are a guessing game, arbitrarily connected (or not) to the lecture material.
In retrospect: a waste of my time.
But, I think the forum is not a good place, since we have to find it meticulously the information and what we want to find is spread out, not in an easy to follow order.
Moreover, I do not think the lectures and the assignments are well synchronized as there are many things in assignments that are outside from the lectures.
This high fidelity, digital work could even be optional, but I need some guidance on what work to develop and how the overall process should look.
Even being allowed to enroll in the capstone before completing the first 7 sections would be helpful.
The review is kind of about what you are looking to get out of these classes.
Furthermore, the points for most of the questions are 6.66, despite what are very different demands fore each part.
It seems like the team have tried to do the whole course in one take!
Low quality video and audio
Please prioritize the additional readings highest value to lowest value and then post only the 4 to 7 reading that rank the highest.
The presentations are awfully boring, there is little interaction of the material (unlike Ng who is deriving the math on screen).
The vidoes only prepared for 1/3 of the workflow asked for, and for the rest one was left alone with a tool that was suboptimally introduced.
5 points out of 5 for professor Peter.
You're better of looking for other Python beginner courses on the Coursera platform, as well as on other platforms.
I enrolled in this course looking for refreshing my info about the 3 subjects and hopefully gaining new in-depth info about them but the information presented during the course was very trivial and only covered few parts about the main 3 subjects
Not worth it outside the specialization.
1st 3 weeks were helpful but questions of the quiz were unclear & improvement is really necessary but still an ok course for basic learners.
It could be much better
Not a course for beginners.
This specialisation started off good in the first 1-2 courses but has since taken many steps back.
While the visual set up is well thought out (you can see the instructor, slides and writing space, the setup of course materials is too stringent for the beginning chemist.
Projects and Quizzes are kind of ok difficulty.
I will recommend this course for the people who are not aware of programming.
Just study the course material is not enough for you to complete your final project, in fact you need peer help or to read more materials to fully understand and finish the project.
On a few occasions the videos would mention something but never discuss the reasoning.
The workload is also vastly different from week to week, including one reading of over 200 pages, indeed a whole book - whilst other lectures demanded only a few pages' worth.
Like previous course in the specialization no slides of the lectures were provided.
Knowledge provided here was just a common sense.
Some of the content and lecturers was fantastic, but some lecturers were quite dull and some lectures and quizzes were poorly written and misleading.
Make sure you know this not very relevant information because it will be on the quiz --- like how to determine the word length and bit depth using some formula involving 2 to the power of something.... it still doesn't make since because I don't know why or how it applies.
Also, note that not everything is completely uniform in DAWs with some terms being different in each one.
It can be better!
The content is very good but the lecture presentation and structure could use improvement.
The difficulty level of this course is very inconsistent.
I suggest to mention quickly how the online and offline assignments work, in particular in how to load data.3 - The feedback from the grader is usually not telling much.
Vague questions coupled with synonymous answers form a frustrating experience that ruins an otherwise decent entry in security topics.
Good, solid advice about setting character, scene and place and ideas to help you out of writer's block.
Audio was difficult to hear at times
I'm sorry to say the course never came close to my expectations, despite the very interesting topic.
Unrelated and incohesive lectures.
In my opinion, the professor's accent and speaking style makes the content difficult to understand.
All of the instructional videos were merely a person reading a Power Point presentation to the viewer.
3 or 4 years after part I went live, part II is still missing and probably will never come out.
The software used in this course, QSTK, is buggy and has been so for 3+ years.
While this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching, the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally.
There was also a lot institutional promoting of the University of Virginia / Batten School itself which I haven't experienced in other courses.
For example, some quiz are much more simpler than the course material, which makes it not helpful at all to understand the course material itself.
Way too much time spent on history that really doesn't matter and on stuff I can find on the net.
Very slow moving.
There was nothing in the course that I didn't already know, but I'm no longer young & I didn't expect there to be.
Hard to catch up and to understand.
The tests after each class are poorly designed.
The quizzes some times ask about things which have nothing to do with what was explained before.
They really don't go into much detail.
The final assignment is good for getting your feet wet but is poorly specified.
I did learn a few things that filled in the gaps with responsive websites, but the tutorials were ultimately not very helpful.
poorly done
I spent close to 3- 8 hr days trying to figure out how to code a simple read/write to EEPROM .
The transition is from easy to advanced.
Great and free.
I understand that it's cheaper and easier for universities to just use recordings of live lectures, but that meant that the lectures contained quite a bit of anecdotal rambling (e.
g.
It would be better to have more exmaple and less theory.
But I take it is part of the challenge ;-)
Too easy, even though I understand it's the first course of the series.
I know what they are, but not everybody does.3) There should be real support material, not merely " transcripts"4) The Peer review does not make any sense.
I follow it in details, but the pace does not match in terms of how you can view the big picture of it.
The other teacher does a much better job at this.
If the output is syntactically correct but provides incorrect output then you're moving forward blindly after that.
Reading or reciting mathematical expressions in a monotonous voice without actually pointing to the visual representation of the lecture material makes it very difficult to follow.
we need explanations rather than trying to figure it out on our own!
The "quizzes" did not help, you could do well on them without actually understanding things (I remember one multiple-choice question where the options were something like (a) "Arrhenius's first law", (b) "Arrhenius's second law", (c) "Arrhenius's third law", and you didn't even have to look at the question or know what the law was to know the answer because only one of Arrhenius's laws had been mentioned in the course at all).
There are two types of videos in this course.
It consists mostly of video lectures there is a lack of coding exercises
it's to general.
Overall, I know that talking and analyzing algorithms can be kinda of boring and challenging, but I wish the course videos could be stated in a more interesting and intriguing way.
Extremely remedial.
This course means well, but with very little critical thinking required, it ultimately communicates good intentions over solid content.
Not going to continue passing other future courses.
In the future it would helpful if either the lectures were modified to be more helpful in completion of the final project or the final project to be reflected of material in the lectures.
The course is not well constricted to guide students.. it's only fill the gaps.
The topics and discussion could be possibly a bit more factual and focused.
The lectures are fairly light and there are no assignments throughout the course to reinforce the material.
information is useful.
this is a good course but if you think better and deeply you will understand that deep inside you your self know this things but maybe you did not do in daily life.
Then it was completely JavaScript.
I want to give a frank feedback since I see a lot of untapped possibilities in this course.
Of course it makes you aware that in both cases you should apply the same behaviour, but I found it a bit too logical...
Unpacking such files and running them on your servers would be an option, maybe.
Should explain, not just read out the presentation.
I suggest saving time and money by buying a book on Mongo and another one on Rails instead.
I am not following the lessons anymore so I left the course.
I was hoping for more content.
The professor did not do that and that got me wondering (not knowing) how to calculate the formulas.
Unfortunately, no tutors/instructors present to supervise the course, which made inconsistencies between course material (slides, videos) and solutions calculated for assignments horribly annoying to deal with, especially for someone like me new to the topic.
(4) Home assignments are not best worded, especially homework assignment for Week 6.
You need to know some statistics.
The contents about SCRUM are presented eight times partially through the introduction and here.
So, it felt like a bait-and-switch to me.
This class is far too theoretical and abstract.
We also had slides on how to split data into a training and testing set on pretty much EVERY lecture - what a waste of time!
The audio quality of a lot of the lectures are quite bad.
A number of the slides seem to be un-organised at times, with repeating information, making them confusing.
While all the information seems to be presented, it feels like it could be done better with more time spent preparing and recording the videos.
For my own part, I've studied and practiced Buddhism for more than 30 years and I am left with little sense of what his aims were for his lectures.
To be more specificDr Germano's Presentation:-he read from what I presume were lecture notes but more likely he was reading from an academic paper.
Again the content and presentation is great.
But the web site is getting really annoying, especially in the assignment area.
The only interesting part was dplyr.
The programming assignment is VERY VERY unsatisfying.
And all this comments like "write a programm before start the quiz" hold me up to ridicule, because as a beginner I don't understand logic of writing.
HTML & CSS are simple, so there's no problem here.
He states the obvious too often, talks VERY slowly, and that makes it hard to stay focused.
I didn't find it as practical and beneficial as the other courses.
The course started really well and followed on nicely from the first course in the series but I'm really disappointed and frustrated with the video editing issues.
Since half hour dramas are unconventional, I asked one of our mentors, JZ (who is great) for examples.
The responsibility should not be on the Mentors to find out-- information like that should be included in the prompt; if not discussed in depth, then at least as a link or list of examples to research on your own if you have the time + desire to do so.
Very nice introduction to the topic.
This type of course structure may work at an undergrad level, but for continuing education it is sub-par.
The video lectures were the instructor reading the slides, reading from the course reading, or showing videos that were listed in the course reading.
This was extremely confusing because I don't use Logix and the lessons do.
Otherwise, all the main points were covered.
The student population had to beg for electronic copies of the materials, which became available around the end of the second week of the four week session.
This course clearly has come ambition to cover important topics on bayesian statistics, however, probably due to time limit, the lecturers have to skim through the contents without further, sometimes necessary explanations.
20 minutes long videos could have been done in 5 minutes.
Then, when I resubmitted it, without changing a comma, I got 20/20.
There's a lack of crucial information such as how to merge AngularJs with all the Back-End.
He terribly prepared us for quizes and gave about 4 examples in the entire course.
First part (HTML&CSS) are good, but JS is to fast and hard to follow for the beginners.
Dry and boring as hell.
All with no official direction as to what was correct, or how things should be properly graded.
In typical Latin American style, the presenter wanders erratically through the material in the videos in a confusing and non-linear way, so that making coherent notes is impossible.
No way I would give 71 $ for such an introductory material.
She also clicks to new slides and bullet points at the wrong time which is very disruptive.
This course is basically a small part of a previous course in International Marketing in Asia.
Most of the topics discussed should be common knowledge to a mid-level manager of data science or even strategic marketing in general.
University of Michigan is the way to go, This course is very out of date
One Module to run through all of these - Circuit switching and packet switching, computer telephony (SS7) and then wireless would have been enough.
I'd say it has nothing in common with parallel programming in Scala.
Quizzes are quite easy to accomplish, but the practical "take-away" from each week is small.
It's crucial for them not to pass the course unless getting a certain score on the final assignment.
This limits the freedom with which to tackle the project's issue.
Although I learned a lot working on the final exam, I felt overly stressed & I had to self teach myself in order to get through it.
That is clearly insufficient.
but since we're all peer reviewing, it's a case of the blind leading the blind there.
The assignments are more or less copy-paste or very repetitive.
I was done with the whole course in a few hours.
As someone who was taking this class without that advantage, I was quickly lost among all the jargon, to the point where I just had to stop.
There are better resources for learning R in general and R programming.
This course was tough, but I dont mind a challenge.
It breezed through a bunch of different plot types without explaining in enough detail what they would be used for or when you should choose to use them.
Didn't learn as much as expected about learning how to learn.
But sadly the sound quality is rather bad: Sounds like an age-old valve radio with A LOT of dropouts.
The instructor's tone of speech gets annoying after a while.
While the material is relevant, the exercises required too much specific knowledge that was not discussed in lecture.
I haven't completed the course yet but after html and css and some javascript, I didn't feel like continuing.
I've taken 5 MOOCs on resume writing and this course is by far the best.
My least favorite course in the series
I am guessing that you had to pay them.
I really expected better.
sounds produced by your DAW) simultaneously with any of the "suggested" programs I tried.
It is important, but I thought the course lacked science and it was very very short.
You need a relatively solid background coming into doing the project beforehand.
Nearly impossible to complete works.
The lectures didn't particularly hold me , either.
The video lectures were good, the tests were almost a give away and the essays were an opportunity to practice what I learned from the lectures.
I will not say it is completely useless, because it is not.
I am relatively experienced programmer trying to just understand the Android app development framework and solve some interesting challenges along the way.
Good teaching is clear, concise, and right to the point.
I spent far too much time researching command syntax and using try and error to find what worked with the provided code.
Disappointing as topics covered are good.
However much of it was not.
Needs some judicious editing.
They use an external tool where one has to enter the information for the assigments, at the end you get a PDF and then you have to copy paste that again into Coursera.
There is some nice general discussions about data science by the teacher, there is the explanation of the package knitr, and little else.
As part of the data science specialization it is nice.
At least structure assignments to combine all of the efforts learned in previous chapters onto one another.
Side note... what is the professor doing filming lectures on vacation or at lunch?
Very little information for the cost.
Readings were not necessary for the course and quizzes were extremely difficult, seeming to be worded in an attempt to stump students, and many questions were not from the course lessons.
All you get is a lame quiz for every week which basically asks to change some variables in the scripts provided.
Difficult to follow if you are new to any type of programming.
But is not without its grievances.
At the end of the day you will choose the platform you work best in.
Over reliance on student grading.
I'm hoping the next courses in the Digital Marketing Capstone are much better so that I'm not watching a lecture and counting how many times the professor pushes his glasses back up.
On the plus side, I did like the engagement this course encourages by forcing you to go to other websites & accomplish things as well as review your peers work.
Better than the Data Scientist's toolbox, but not a great introduction to R. When I'm learning a new language, I don't want to know about data types and for loops.
Some minimal stats knowledge should be recommended as a pre-requisite for this course, or else you end up doing like those monkeys using a statistical software without really understanding what they are doing and drawing conclusions with blissful ignorance.
I must say that the Capstone Project was a good assignment.
Overall it was just okay.
Also (maybe because being that easy), peer review is compromised by people who doesn't really know what they're doing there, with comments that were clearly made without any knowledge about the subject.
The only thing that has lasted has been Social Security and that is under attack by a co-opted ultra-conservative Congres
If no one able to understand you, it is useless.
Perhaps a better title for this course is Social Media Analytics.
No value added :(.
I think you should reflect on this.
Many materials have broken links and the lack of character entry for some practice problems poses an issue as pinyin with tones is rather hard to type.
I would except more professional approach and not videos likely taken on first shot with errors.
Also there are a lot of material which lector things is fun and cool, but it is really anoying.
I was unable to replicate what he presented throughout the project (figuring it out on my own after-the-fact), as he would jump ahead in sections while verbally NOT visually detailing what he would be doing next.
this is heavy material, and I suggest it be broken down to two separate courses, and the author take his time in explaining the various concepts in much more detail vs. trying to cram them within 5 or 10 minute sessions.
needs more case studies and examples
Totally unbalanced!
Definitions were not given.
I did not have any knowledge in those areas and I found it hard to follow everything mentioned in the course.
Course material providing out-dated concepts.
Slides were not translated to English, so external sources were required to understand many of the slides.
I am really not sure if you need 20-30 minutes videos to explain the material - I think maybe 7-10 minutes clear with some good examples would be more helpful, I fell sleep during some of the lectures, boring, long and not sure if necessary - on the other hand I guess 20-30 minutes is good because you learn to put up with arguments and clear them up yourself - also maybe this course was directed towards high school students thus the long explanations -Overall, as I said on the beginning, it would work better with clear definitions and some examples and discussion board -
Turned out to be a course in financials rather than modeling.
Disappointed!
I learned a few things.
However, the assignments in the class were based much more on the lectures and on self-reflection than on the materials.
I can't understand what he is talking about but you have to make it clear thru using swirl.
Disappointed by this class.
Much too slow
The course is not compelling in any way.
Also writes over the slide material.
I am all for difficult challenges, but it felt like the final project was badly designed/described.
The relationship between the video, quiz and supplemental reading is sometimes hard to determine.
There are many parts of the lectures that are very quiet and even with my speakers turned to max, I struggled to hear, while other parts were clear.
(Which by now can be seen with hindsight)
Not enough material covered to make it worth the cost.
Content is good.
The course lacks examples to bring things to life.
and the multiple-choice quizzes stuck me a lot.
Not very much information and lesson to learn deep
The lecture videos are not super helpful and the instruction and support for final project is somewhat lacking.
Very good course!
Professor draws on an eletronic chalkboard (with a very bad handwriting) and you need to keep going back to videos when you are doing the homework.
Price Foundation (http://www.
westonaprice.
org/) to learn what to cook, in particular their Healthy4Life dietary guidelines (http://www.
westonaprice.
org/wp-content/uploads/Healthy4LifeEnglish.
pdf).
I did not finish this class as I couldn't stand the videos.
The subject of this course is awesome and very interesting.
Instead of being tested on the material just learned, it seemed like the objective was to learn to decode test questions.2 and the most glaring omission, was that when students are asked to provide functions, only some are provided with a follow up test to ensure the function is working properly.
The content of the course is very good, but the proffesors could really do better.
Actually it's rather hard to understand how JavaScript works if you'd never learnt it before this course.
Much of the syntax is outdated in updated external libraries.
The readings were appropriate and the course out line solid.
They only work on Windows with Java 6 installed.
Course lacks real example and full of theory.
Each of these could worth a full Coursera course and I am sure the other courses have better coverage than in this course.
The quiz questions are not well thought and do not stimulate thinking at all.
The practice part of every week is just a waste of the time.
I can't say "money well spent".
This course is not that interesting.
Basic introduction to data analytics
Introductory Course mostly around installation and setup for the other courses in Specializations
I end up spending way to much time on this course than I planned to.
The instructions for the final project were very unclear and even though I submitted all assignments well before their respective deadlines and reviewed the required number of projects my work was not processed for a grade thereby delaying my specialization completion.
you have access to the material, but you have to pay 80 USD to take simple quizzes....
Quality of video recording is kind of crappy esp.
It is a pity because I had great expectation in this course.
The videos are badly edited, and there did not seem to be a lot of content within this course.
Much of the code is outdated (I'm using python 3.5).
If there hadn't been so many hiccups with the videos and quizzes I would recommend this course.
But there was a lot of ambiguity and bias and the inability to discuss except through the forums was off-putting.
It wouild be good to know why answers were wrong in the quizzes particulalry when you had put a lot of effort into studying them.
In the final exam, there are questions which are evidently wrong, both in their wording and in their marking and nothing has been done to remedy this in spite of the complaints in the discussion page.
Too high level the course is.
On another hand, the last 2 weeks were bad, professor Mike didn't do well in term of summary.
In fact it was often impossible to read the text in the slide due to the size of the presenters head which obscured the text.
completely missed the explanation part of the teaching.
i have taken a couple other introductory biology/genetics courses so some of the information was familiar, but i (and a friend who watched over my shoulder) found the videos nearly unwatchable due to the slow pace the presenters were speaking
(2 STARS)Overall, I don't recommend this anyone, especially if you are beginners.
Instead we got an "open-ended" problem description with few if any input on Yahoo's operations.
Proof reading needed, for the slides and for the quizzes.
A bit thin on the psychology.
If your goal is to just get a certificate to put on your resume, this specialization will check the box.
Coursera needs to do a much better job at insuring that their professors are offering a quality course and living up to the expectations of the students.
You end up retaking the quiz time and again and then selecting random answers just to pass.
This course is to much about graphlab and not enough about the mechanics of machine learning.
The calibre of students is poor and informed discussions non-existent.
I know that hackers skill should be used but it is too much assumption in the projects!
Much better Courses are available for free on udacity and edx.
My current online Statistics with Calculus course is rewarding and I feel like I'm truly gaining mastery of the topics, whereas in the Basic Statistics course I was floundering.
The graphics in the way the lessons are presented are well done!
The very first lesson implies that sufficient quantities of micronutrients can't be obtained from a diet high in animal-based proteins and fats.
That said, the last question in the last exam, was an order of magnitude more challenging than everything else set and almost felt like a "shake out" question.
While these concepts are really useful, I expected more details on, for example, how to implement the _parallel_ construct used throughout the lectures.
If IE wants to stay relevant in this online space, some benchmark is advised...
Not up to my expectations.
Unfortunately this project is not fully aligned with all the previous program, which is a shame.
In general the types of assignments do not lend themselves too well to peer review.
I lost momentum and even motivation and as a result am now behind with the assignments and quizzes.
In addition, it is practically impossible to get support from Coursera when an issue exists and in most cases when contact is made, the assistance is minimal.
In lesson one, this was repeated 11 times.
Learning anything from this course - at least for me - is very hard.
I got tired of hearing about walking or bicycling to work as the main way to get active.
It is not very "advanced"
You will go to learn a lot like I do.
it's rather a course on using API of proprietary software with very very basic background on the actual math underneath
Great idea.
I would disagree.
It concentrates heavily on the logistical side of negotiations via mathematical analysis to figure out "what's at stake" in a negotiation (i.
e.
I passed this class by switching sessions multiple times in order to use the time to learn the practical skills in data visualization I needed to pass the tests.
Additionally, the presented materials and the lecture format are very uninspiring.
The lectures are very superficial, even though the quizzes and projects demand a lot of knowledge and time.
It's so confusing.
Couldn't get any help from forums.
Very disjointed and no clear progression.
I just wanted to check out this course.
I started this course but I find that it is very difficult to concentrate.
Use a demo and I can get it right away.3.
So when you think that you have 3 days left to meet the deadline ... wrong, you should've started 4 days ago.
This in combination with the ridiculously detailed instruction videos, which consist to 95% of a tutor reading aloud what is written on the assignment webpage.
The rest is self-PR and "water".
Also, most of the sample implementations will not run on a modern computer.
There are a lot of small misleadings notes in course materials.
Again who cares?
Way too much way too fast.
Seriously?
This class was really difficult.
).
If you wish to learn machine learning, take the Stanford course on Machine Learning for Andrew Ng.
Sorry, maybe it's just me, but I got to have much more then about an hour of explanation to do so.
I was hoping to learn more about some of the principles of character design- wasnt blown away by this course wont be taking any more of these
the classes are sometimes extremely boring and some things are not clearly explained
I believe this course suffers from neglect.
The first project (stack smashing) was difficult, at least for me, but I could complete it with the information taught in the lectures.
The two stars I gave were because the instructor seems knowledgable and the rest of the specialization looks promising.
Pretty fast click-through as start into project management.
Also what's the point of having mentors if they don't engage with you?
Difficult content not explained well by the presenters.
But from 4th week the course changes to advanced knowledge.
It was a very enjoyable course up till the end of module three where things went a bit awry; mosty due to the unexplained withdrawal of the discussion forem and the failure of the third party platform to perform correctly at 123D (which left us doing assignments that couldn't be completed with the assigned tools).
A big part of the fourth module was about connecting and communicating with the internet via ethernet and wifi.
Cheesy.
Good course, but severely hobbled by the transition to the new platform.
You cannot record from your microphone and capture internal sound card information (i.
e.
Lost after 2nd week.
I had issues uploading the Assigned Homeworks, course was ok, still, a bit complex and fast to be treated as intro to ruby
This should be fixed.
Some of the videos are just stutters, repetitions and filling words.
There are many other materials online that can cover the same amount of information in less time and easier to understand.
Good focus on ideas vs principles.
Loads of statistical content along with high-level R content means it was probably the toughest of the 4 I have taken so far in the Coursetrack.
This is definitely not a course for beginners .
Not much content
The speaking style and body language of the instructor was quite monotonous when teaching the content.
It was fairly easy and short.
Also, there is repeated talk of practical exercises to come, but that never happens.
It would have been more interesting to look at a few things more in depth.
The lessons are essentially a reference guide and not a useful approach for teaching.
Lost my interest Half way.
Probably a course for non-native English speaking students.
The mathematical symbols sometimes didn't encode at all.
This, and a presentation style that made me feel "talked down to", similar to reading a story book to a small child, made comprehension of ideas frustratingly difficult.
I am facing the exact same problem with this course as I faced with earlier course.
The grading process is badly constructed for final assignment.
Very poor lecture support for the assignments.
I think this course might have been great if I did it like 5th or 6th in the certificate sequence.
But they only say that as you start week 6!- The course doesn't provide sufficient material for the final assignment.
Thanks for all your efforts.
I initially found the week two section very frustrating due to the absence of worded examples (real sentences) that might've appeared alongside the logic-symbols that were being defined.
It reminded me of my days at the university where I found being a great scientist/engineer didn't mean you were a great teacher.
Videos are fast-paced, material is limited (no real slides or extensive doc).
Granted it cannot be interactive since it’s not a live classroom, but it can be made to somewhat sound like an interactive session...
Some slides are too verbal.
The material need better preparation and it seems at times to be ad-hoc coding.
It isn't worth the mo
The Virtual Machine Experiment was very difficult to implement because the instructors' format did not allowenough detailed instruction specific to each OS platform.
Inability to speed up and move on to next module
For instance, context switching when describing the disadvantages of microkernels, or pre-emptively scheduled systems - I have a CS background and had no problem with these aspects, but I am aware I am highly subjective.
A bit light in terms of content, this probably could have been condensed down into 2 lessons.
The lecturer also sounded a bit unnatural with pauses in sentences where you wouldn't expect them, making it harder to process information.
The course Info was too simple.
And this is the real problem, even things that should be easy to grasp are difficult to understand -just the opposite of prof. Bill Boyd who makes learning a joy-.
The assignments are too easy also because of over specific assignments instructions.
a let down and not up to par with other courses in the series.
Huge amount of time is wasted bsically repeating that the API is close to scala collections'.
The instruction for this course seems like she does not the subject well enough to provide insight and quite possibly as if this is the first time she is giving a lecture/presentation.
I wouldn't mind getting feedback from a professional graphic designer though if they're available.
Thanks for understanding.
Nice, but very basic.
Same with the materials, it would be great if the readings and the suggested bibliography details could be downloaded.
I was expecting to gain fundamental understanding of the various parameters and what they really do and a more solid understanding of the process of creating custom patches rather then following an example and subsequently making minor adjustments so that it fits my style.
There are mistakes in some code examples and quiz questions are sometimes ambiguous.
They are generally good social skills that every one should have.
The early material was fine but again presentation could be dramatically improved.
Before signing up, I read the prerequisites - there were none!
Also the social media tips seem to be very interesting if you're 65+.
Which would explain why you are asking 50 dollars just to take the quizzes.3.
What I've watched wasn't as what I expected.
I would give it 2 out of 5 as addressing my needs.
Plus the grading system is not upto the mark.
Too expensive to be that simple.
In fact, I feel terrible if anyone ponied up $100+ for it.
There are better courses on the subject on coursera and other platforms.
The material offered is introductory level.
At times it was as though the professor was rushing to introduce new modules rather than discussing how and why certain concepts should be used.
Please beef up the videos and the assignments.
The exams and projects are really really hard and make R newbies, such as I, feel very suffering.
Validating your code as you move along seems like a pretty rudimentary process to impart to students and when the teachers don't practice it themselves, there are bound to be problems.
I like the intent of the course, and considering my outsider background to computer science, the mathematics etc, I did learn a fair bit.
two stars because I really suffered during this course .
I didn't like the instructor behavior of explaining the topics he represents.
First of all I didn't like the idea of building over one website, if you didn't get what was happening so you already ruined a part of the total website which you will continue building over during the whole coursesecond the assignments requirements requires additional searches which wasn't explained in details during the sessionthird the explanation is so boring and you can easily lose your concentration because of poor communication skillsforth the assignments requires two many details really, Also I need to get the code of other classmates using "get source code " option on my google chrome and then run it again , there are much efficient ways to handle that like running the delivered assignment directly on the server
Some of the lecturers are rather inexperienced.
Most (if not all) of the useful content is presented in sections called web tours which are collections of websites were one can find information about the specific topic of a lesson.
This time I had to leave the course before finishing because:1st: content is organized awfully (for example "HTML overview" - I knew all the material so I have an idea how it should look like, but lecturer started from the middle of all concepts, than moved to the beginning and together it looked like an unlinked content.
You will learn way more by doing the swirl exercises than watching the lectures by a long way.
In conclusion, I finished the course with nothing more than a rudimentary understanding of R despite the fine grades.
The course is too superficial.
Anyone can do that.
I often wonder if anyone on the UCSD/Coursera side ever actually tries to complete the assignments.
There were many instances where the lectures could have gone in to much more detail and just didn't, I appreciate that you can't cover everything in lectures, but would it have killed you to provide or at least point to some good additional reading resources?The assessments were the worst part.
I didn't even watch the lectures here from disappointment).
But the professors really do have a charm to them so I will give them an extra star for that.
Many assumptions are made by this professor that makes it less approachable by a beginner, IMO.
the introduction to Fusion is more a customer presentation to advanced CAD user than a tutorial for newbies.
The course material did not cover anything that we needed to complete the final exam.
Instead you are directed to massive amounts of readings with no guidance on what should be read.
Great idea but unprofessional design and programming.
Looks like nobody double-checked it before starts to offer it, especially for money.
Almost every Quiz and separate questions has programming bugs.
Waiting for ver 2 ASAP.
It had some interesting thoughts in it, but not much information.
Material was interesting, but mentors/teaching assistants and the course director were non-existent.
I was expecting to learn more as the course structure was impressive BUT the actual lectures are not covered the topic.
He should take over the whole course and let Mr. Campbell do some research back in his office.
I felt that the course would have been more substantial if it had been built on the obvious fact that the US revolutionaries were "Englishmen fighting for an Englishman's rights."
It looks easy but the lecturer didn't make it clear what it was for anyway.
A much more thorough introduction should have been given to everything.
The lectures on the Rasberry Pi were a joke.
Instead, it is a lecture from Power Points, that don't really line up with the assignments very well.
If you have previous knowledge in another language, you'll do fine, but if you're truly looking for a beginner course, look elsewhere.
I bet many students will have a problem in this course since it's a 'beginner' level specialization.
My suggestion is to 'slow down' , expand the lecture with more drawing/picture explanation, more r coding and get rid of those greece-symbol as much as possible.
I don't know when I've struggled so hard to keep my attention and focus on the material.
Do not like the slides and the way it is explained.
Interresting, but too easy to understand.
Very Informative course but without Certificate.
Extremely poor help and feedback.
Almost no replies on discussion forums from mentors/peers so many issues end up unresolved.
The course is very simple
Superinteresting subject, but since I did not have access to all the literature through the website I was not able to finish it unfortunatly
Nice explanations, but for amateurs.
Because of the missing support I was not able to solve the assignments under Windows with Octave.
So either the course description didn't provide enough information for a non-statistician to realize it will get very complex, or the language and explanations should have been simplified/more descriptive for the audience.
Come on, is this useful?
Questions are bad: i.
e.
Could use more specific examples.
First, the the "prof" who talked about visuals OVERPLAYED the role of visuals online.
The installation of R and github account videos should be added to the next course as an introduction.
All explanations are clear and too powerful for understanding.
Two stars because all tests you can submit if purchase certificate.
I think the whole topic of the talent pipeline was completely lacking structure and cohesiveness.
Could be a useful course if you've never worked with IT projects, or for younger students.
expensive platform, mostly because there are many other free packages available for machine learning.
Just for get our opinion.
I think it would be possible to have one's wisdom teeth removed and complete this course on a binge-watching spree while on pain killers.
I have the same issue with the next course.
Just that alone made a huge difference and it then helps me focus on how to write the R code rather than trying to understand the math.
The lectures do not prepare you very well for the Quizzes and even less for the assignments.
Some Korean reference ("noon sei" or something like that ) are non-value adding.
If he's so shy he might just do voice-overs.
Very poor didactic style.
It only touches the surface of the subject.
It's because of bad advice given in webinars like this one.
The course covers very useful and interesting topics, not in very much detail though.
They are reading off an autocue and it shows.
I liked fun videos, some explanations and teachers.
People just don't have the time or the experience to give any substantial feedback.
I'm not sure if she's a mother or not, but that's the way she comes across--like she's trying to squeeze massive and advanced theory into a pill designed for ten year-olds.
A majority of this class simply glossed over things we already learned in the intro class, and she would often list things she was going to talk about, and then ignore one of those items entirely.
So its impossible to do the assignment 3 and assignment 4 has nothing to do with what is tought in week 4
The course goes kinds of fast, this is first course of the Specialization and it quickly jumps to Greedy algorithm, really?
This is NOT a step-wise introduction to R for the novice.
Spent a frustrating amount of time trying to get what most likely is simple code to work.
I'm hoping this particular module is revised.
https://www.
insidehighered.
com/blogs/hack-higher-education/problems-peer-grading-coursera to know more).
On the upside, videos are well edited and clear and easy to understand.
The content seems to be excellent regarding "what" is presented.
As an auditor, I am no longer able to participate in the assignments or quizzes in this class.
making sure that your data covers all that you expect).
Having a background in theoretical physics and computer science, this duality in this course is very confusing for me.
I tackled this challenge by sort of haphazardly googling journey maps and praying my submission would come across as somewhat logical.
Ultimately I'm very disappointed with this part of the specialization.
Starts off great, but quickly jumps into really dense course material moving quickly between topics with few images or examples while watching the lecturer slowly scribble on the slides.
Additionally the way the content is presented is very flat.
And in order to submit my final assignment I had to embedded my images into a word doc and export it as a PDF...
Having known about mindfulness, Metta meditations, gratitude, it became personally disappointing to me how this course conveyed so little about them and impacted so less than can be possible with the time and space alloted.
Although, it might also help that I had class completely on HTML and CSS in the past, so I actually know what to do to write necessary code.
I wasn't wild about sitting through lectures about being active while pregnant or making sure my kids exercise.
I find that extremely frustrating.
Until 3rd week is perfectly alright.
This specialization really needs to spend equal time on the programming aspect.
The course and the knowledge provided is OK.
Too bad, as I was genuinely curious of the topic.
The marking system was inaccurate, for example it deducted marks for submitting an assignment over word count when it wasn't!
But it became very tough for me to continue because the sound in the videos was not very clear.
this course needs much more evidences and examples to support the valuable information.
While I enjoyed this course and the topics covered, I don't feel like the course content matched what the course description stated it was supposed to.
Pros:Effort has been taken in putting up the assignments.
Cons:Quality of teaching is very poor and too fast to follow through .
- but there is detailed explanation of what A squared means in lesson two (!
Why did you have all of those people that are in the field of cybersecurity just read off a list of terms?
Material is very useful and interesting!The course introduces concepts in a progressive and comprehensive way so that knowledge is easy to be understood.
The discussion forums are also poorly monitored, unlike other Coursera courses; which does not advance understanding.
Very poor instruction and organization of topics, very poor explanation of core concepts.
I did not want to learn such things.
Personally felt this course have a lot more potential.
Great first week, terrible following week
This course has some great information and guidance for delving into the social media landscape.
The word "introduction" generally means something basic and fundamental.
Same assignments but more information would have been great.
The slides are the centrepiece of the course, as the presenters rarely stray from the bullet points and pseudocode they're comprised of.
I learned a lot during this course.
This course relies heavily on self-reading and theoretical knowledge.
Lots of theoretical information but very little practical information about what to do with people with Autism Spectrum Disorder
Two stars because I have found poor explanations of assignments.
It also seemed to be full of self - congratulations about what UPENN has accomplished with its research.
Exercises are however close to challenges you face in real life.
As people can read in the course discussion forums, students have been asking for months for improvements to the grading systems.
Unfortunately, didn`t enjoy this course at all.
I am sorry I enrolled in this course.
(This, again, is partially an issue of the class being so short; more time to review = the option to have longer pilots, rather than only accepting half hour pilots in order to allow students to review five different submissions within three days.)
Unfortunately there was no detail at all about how to backtest, where to get data for backtesting, where to find research papers upon which to base an algorithm, etc.
A great pity because the content on occasion is interesting.
The pass mark on the quizzes is around 80%.
Level of difficulty of lectures is not correspond with level of quizzes.
It almost seems like it was thrown together without a clear mission of what should be in the introduction.
It feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors.
Half of this course should have been condensed or excluded.
The instructor starts by talking about why they are useful, and then followed by one to two 10-15 minutes long video lectures.
too simple
I won't be continuing this specialization.
On the very last quiz, I was not able to finish the course because the answer for one of the questions was incorrect.
Better just use an audio-phrasebook and repeat it using the same time.
They ask for 1-2 sentence answers max!
This course is not as polished as most other courses on coursera.
The course was informative and some of the material regarding databases will be useful towards my current job.
This course covers a good amount of bayesian statistics.
The video lectures are not very polished, and I think it would have been better to have a few longer videos than so many short ones.
for Aperture, Shutter and DOF.
I am not sure if that i going to be covered in next unit but having gone though the basics in 1st unit, that was expectation in 2nd unit.
The videos are quite ok and cover a good part of what I think this course should be about.
The topics covered could have been taught a lot better.
The concept of this course is unique and pretty interesting, but videos are too short, basic and non-specific, they have vague connection with the rest of the materials.
Ref: "A Crash Course in Data Science" the content could be presented in a simpler way.
Cheri's presentations were not as engaging as the others and her slides were poorly prepared - often difficult to read and not necessarily related to the topic at hand
Points for trying though.
Also, no Boyer-Moore?-After passing all test cases for a homework, we should be able to download a solution with the correct implementation, in order to improve our own.
this is only a money making course.
Also, this course started too late after the other courses and I lost a lot of momentum in completing coursework.
The project I had no clue where to begin.
I think that a lot more that could be explained and taught in this course.
If others were interested in learning about the basics of music theory, I would not recommend this course.
Regardless, students did learn how to use VM-Ware to make a virtual cloud on a home network and control it via smartphone.
At the start of the course the lectures and sparse supporting material were only available in video format; not very conducive for detailed review.
The assignments are also very simple and automatically graded.
Yes, I noticed that the earth is spinning the wrong way in the "sun at an angle around the sun" graphic but who cares?
Particularly I think the video should be better made to present the spreadsheet content more clearly and i think there should be more emphasis on important points during the lecture session.
If you already know everything about the topic and just forgot some little things or you are very strong in calculus, this may be a nice refresher.
The course feels pretty shallow and it ignores all the interesting stuff like proofs.
The assessments are not relevant to the material covered and there are no collateral materials (e.
g., downloadable slides/handouts) available to assist in learning.
As competition in the online e-learning domain increases at an impressive speed, you should benchmark what I mentioned above and do something about it, or probably after 2/3 runs of your courses, people with churn for more addedd value offerings in the dimensions that I pointed out.
Good luck.
It's not that difficult to have a native speaker proof-read before publishing (I would be happy to do this for you, any job openings?).
Didn't teach more.
I found the course disappointing.
I found much of this material wasn't as applicable to excel analysis as hoped and didn't cover many of the analysis tools
As a stand-alone course, I would definitely not recommend it.
Nevertheless, the lectures are interesting and well taught.
I am a developer and know how to create advanced websites.
However, this course will be okay if you are working on some other field and want data management as an extra skillset.
I am born in France and I guess we learn this from our families.
The course content is great, but peer evaluation is simply useless and almost random.
This course is not recommended for those who have zero or little experience in the field..
Understand this should be introduction to Big Data...
Despite of been a interesting course I find it really hard to pass it.
The videos are informative but the notes are fairly lacking.
As an INFLUENCER who has been approached by many marketers in the past decade "to help them understand something" (etc) I can tell you, we do suss you out quickly and treat you appropriately.
Quizzes had errors in them that made passing them unnecessarily difficult.
Good introduction of what is to come, but nothing too provocative or thought provoking.
And give pop-up quiz in video
I would suggest researching every subject covered, to get a bit more depth, and moving through it at a brisk pace.
Nearly all the reforms that they initiated were countered by the end of the 20th century.
I appreciate this is the first time the course has been run, but this really felt phoned in and unacceptable.
You need to spend hours and hours just UNDERSTANDING what you need to do.
It is just a form of regurgitation of online articles from strategy consulting firms with Quiz's artificially made more difficult with cheap word plays.
It'll only take you about an hour.
I am not by any means saying that the quizzes are hard or simple, I am saying that they lack objectivity and go beyond the scope of the materials and try to put the student on a state of trying to guess what the instructor's opinion is regarding the question at hand.
The assignments required real craft however, and it would have been helpful to LEARN those skills in the modules.
For example, one assignment asked us to describe a character in a setting, while they were not actually there - say a divorced nurse in a hospital.
Four weeks were spent on this external topic while the more interesting discussion on using python with databases is glossed over haphazardly in the last week.
I am a big fan of this specialization and think Prof.
Poor presentation of topics, I don't recommend.
I would not recommend this course to anyone interested in an introductory linguistics course.
Also the assessment is not interesting and there is no much information in the teaching material in order to be able to do the assessment.
I am very disappointed with this Specialization.
But it doesn't worth the money.
I think they need to carefully look at the questions with the most incorrect answers and ask themselves if they've made a mistake.
Honestly, I find it very hard to recommend this course to anyone.
One or two concepts is not enough to gain an understanding.
This course is too short.
The assignments were not challenging enough.
I would have learned more if it was better aligned and there were some exercise in between.
Perhaps on my end there could be a cultural misunderstanding in how a quiz checks your knowledge of the source material?
Provided Unity scripts for projects don't work properly with newer versions of Unity.
Furthermore, if you miss a step in the video, your file may very well be ruined and you need to rewatch the video again to see what you missed.
Also, the course is extremely slow paced.
Yes, I know people who create drama, however, there have been no blowouts or severe problems.
I was most excited about taking this class (in fact, it's how I found the specialization as a whole) and I did not get as much out of it as I was hoping for.
The most useful part seems to be about the goal setting, and that is what I'd recommend to start with for most students.
This material could have been compressed into 1 week.
The information is good but is going too fast and I don't feel I have learned much from it.
Otherwise I found this to be an interesting course and I learned quite a bit from it, although it could have been condensed into three or four classes at the very most.
It very much feels as if they have adapted a traditional course on their own without the help of professionals who are skilled at designing online courses.
It covers theoretical part of "What big data is" and basic info about Hadoop.
The course seems more like a cut-and-paste version of Prof. Shiller's "Financial Markets" course from Yale Open Courses than a proper Coursera MOOC.
Absolutely useless random un-explained list of facts and advices that is thrown to a learner without any attempt to give a systematic approach.
It's just him explaining and explaining and explaining and explaining.
Quizs ask some questions that is not clearly mentioned in the lecture and some are with a little ambiguity.
This is not a beginner's course.
I was unable to complete this course, because the course required at least two years of programming knowledge prior to enrolling.
where things go wrong.
Javascript, CSS, JQuery is very vast and it is not possible to learn everything in one course.
This course was full of issues related to the installation and use of Pentaho Pivot 4J and Data Integration.
The lectures were not very interesting or instructive.
this course just for a newbie
What I expect from a Course are baby steps and clear guidance about good practices.
This class is a text high schooler student's nightmare almost to the point to be an homage to the boring economic class at the beginning of " Ferris Bueller's Day Off "https://www.
youtube.
com/watch?v=uhiCFdWeQfA
Could have been better!!
Seems to me the professor needs to study evolution a bit more or change his language a bit.
It's simply very uninspiring and boring to listen to.
I had to google the function to learn it.- They say to complete each piece of the final assingment after you finish the respective week related to that piece.
This course was difficult for me to grasp.
Most of the time, he didn't make any points.
Emulation is slow and almost un-usuable with plenty of boilerplate code required to do simple events.
I spent 90% of my time trying to figure out python through stack overflow.
I'm not saying that each course should be accompanied by an e-book, but honestly, if I wanted to learn about Bayesian Statistics from Wikipedia I could have well skipped this class.
The main reason I'm giving 2 stars to the course instead of 1 is the Labs and the Quizzes.
The first courses are great.
Unfortunately, the course that covered the installation (week 2 - "create your first basic application with android studio") got me lost.
The SDGs were agreed upon in 2015 and there are already ajor efforts ongoing to implement them.
Writing function in R really isn't that easy especially for an R beginner who only has little knowledge of R packages and functions.
As a captstonse course I expected this to be more challenging than other courses in the specialisation, especially the assignments which should have required to put in some real effort rather than simply executing pre-written scripts and uploading screenshots.
Quizzes often asked questions in a way that was not covered in the course material and were therefore quite difficult to figure out at times.
Not for beginners unless ready to spend lots of extra hours watching the videos several times and surfing on the web to get additional information
I think 'courses' that are fully setup like this should be opt-in not required.
I mean, it is "too many" new things in the assignment.
Points get belabored (I usually watched the lectures at 1.5x speed but I also have some basic Tableau experience).
I'm sure he's a brilliant man, but an adequate lecturer he is not.
Too much focus on remembering specific details and numbers, and too little focus on broader understanding.
Personally, did not like the pace of the course.
Videos are poorly done and leave a lot of useful details out.
The content of the course lacks in substance compared to the "An Introduction to American Law" course.
Not recommended for pros.
)The assignments and due dates are oddly crunched together (another time constraint issue, I understand), but the Instructor's videos seem to imply that we should be receiving feedback before proceeding each time?
In my case I thankfully started with the free model so I didn't lose out, but I could see others being dissapointed.
Bad experience.
I also feel that if you are going to offer transcriptions of the lectures, someone should proofread them.
CJ Taylor is an enthusiastic lecturer and the material was presented in an enjoyable easy to understand way and having finished the course, I definitely want to learn more about computational motion planning.
The problems I have with this course though are numerous.
Nevertheless I hope this feedback can be of any good.
But this course wasn't taught well.
There are entries in the db seed data that cause trouble, leading to intensive debugging and modification of given files that require a much more experienced programmer to figure out.
Angular 1 not Angular 2 which is disappointing but worse still, it teaches use of scope which is no longer recommended by the angular team themselves.
Could be vastly improved by using modern angular best practice such as "Controller As" syntax and teaching you to write code that is more "compatible" with Angular 2
(this is based on the unpaid material)This course should be scrapped and not offered as an unpaid course.
Some of the concepts are excessively focused in Asia... Also the LG interview videos seem excessivelly of 'free' publicity.
final project almost impossible based on lectures
I just finished this course.
Would love to see more advanced graduate level content included.
Course material is fine.
But the instructor isn't the most inspiring.
It's not bad information, but it could have been done in one week.
Quiz questions would then focus on the off topic information making it confusing with regard to what material to focus on during a lecture.
Can I suggest that any future version of this course includes the following:-include a video which presents the main aspects of the historical development of Buddhism.
It seemed to me like an ad or Präsentation for this high school.
However the quiz contains several mistakes and I wasted many hours.
The concepts discussed could have been easily understood in 3 weeks (at max).
Many technical issues in the quizzes (such as questions not showing up, being marked incorrectly).
References are not hard to find and post in Resources.
Not quite good but practical
Where the answer are some quite different technologies.
The course needs more involvement of the students by going more in-depth and adding some practical exercises.
Had the cloud computing specialization started with this course, I would probably have aborted it.
I do not feel I have learnt anything of substance.
Many of the assignment questions are poorly written.
Very repetitive content, provide only some abstract presentation of the technics used.
If you aren't familiar with cooking and nutrition this course is a good fit.
This is more like a one hour lecture than an actual course.
Although I'm very interested in the topic I am asking myself after the first view videos if I should continue or drop because my cognitive capacitity is for me to worthful to use it for the decoding of badly prepared and presented material.
The instructor did not provide enough instruction or reading material to complete the quiz each week.
The course creators tried to squeeze in many concepts in 4 weeks.
As for information in course itself, it was interesting for me to enroll and to be part of the course.
But I highly dislike that there was a feeling of that the lecturer is trying to remember any things right while the video goes.
I am sure he knows his material cold and I am sure that he is much better "live" in class.
I's not exactly class for the beginners.
But I cannot complete this course, because part of Dr. Alexander is impossible to listen.
Asked for more feedback for peers that found my final paper insufficient.
If he didn't have time for proper preparation, he should have found another medium for flogging his publications.
By and large, everyone who is from the US (I'm not) and who teaches about the US constitution emphasizes its uniqueness.
Very dry content and hard to retain any information presented in the course because of it.
However, I did indeed learn a few things.
Fail.
This course is where the material starts to get difficult, and the learning materials fail to provide the structure needed.
Only the link agilemanifesto.
org has real value in this course.
The course did allow me to just space through and then submit with no actual answer, but doing so does impact your final pass/fail.-I signed up with the intent to take all five courses.
It is a good brush up course but a lot of it was common sense.
The theory is excellent but the exercises are too difficult for beginners.
The amount of information covered in this course is just right for a beginner.
There are no lecture slides neither consistent addtional resources to grasp seriously the materials.
I will seek other methods to learn.
Which I rated as 5 and 4 accordingly, but this one is fail.
That said, I appreciate that as a software engineer, I might find this sort of thing much easier than most, but even so I don't feel as though the programming assignments helped me learn anything.
Overall, regardless of how interesting the material was, this course was very shoddily put together.
Quite repetitious in covering basic graphing, and very shallow in regards of clustering, SVD and PCA.
i really want to start with actually making a computer game not a paper game
But if your are not a beginner, you won't need this, so…
I still made an attempt to watch the course content, but found the instructor speaking more about what he planned to cover rather than actually covering anything of substance.
Quite disappointing.
I recommend to other students to read the Wikipedia articles about the subjects instead.
I think the ratings on this are misleading.
.
Multiple Choice Questions should follow the principles exposed in the 6th course of the specialization program, which seems to not be done at all.
The anwers to the exams are so relative or subjective, and that's a problem for those who does not domain English very well, just like me.
Assignments are basically handed to you where you only need to alter one line of text to get the right answer on what is supposed to take an hour.
Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python thru Rice U has content and weekly mini projects that really push your learning ability and after taking the courses, I felt like I really got something out of it.
This course barely scratches the surface of "Accessing Web Data" and does nothing to challenge your coding skills.
it's so hard for beginners in my opinion
So the only source was repository http://kasperdanielhansen.
github.
io/genbioconductor/ with html files.
The forum is not as useful as I expected nor as it is in other Coursera courses.
3.
The course is essentially a self-help guide focusing on the idea that cooking real food promotes health.
The Internet began as a text communications vehicle, not a medium to share graphics (etc).
I am learning a lot but I can not afford to pay.
But it does not has lecture slides that is better for students to understand.
However, three weeks of slides and theory and then only the last two weeks of seeing code hardly makes the course project-centered in my mind.
Very light in useful content
foreign accent is totally ok, but very poor presentation skills by lecturer.
There were also several instances where the percentages taught to us were marked wrong in the quiz.
Unfortunately there is no involvement academic staff so there is no assistance/support.
Headed downhill.
Most of what it talked about were the basics and what common high school students would know.
Definitely not IE Business School material !
Not hard, but exhausting and not interesting.
Combination of basic content on the one hand and highly specialised information / terminology without explanation on the other was not helpful to learning.
It started really well with the deduction and induction ...
Morely designed on slideshows, not effective.
I would have given just one star except the swirl() assignments are actually very good.
Extraordinarily basic.
This course is best for recent graduates.
Not really good translation in the subtitles
The final assignment gives you a largely complete project and just asks you to make a few changes.
It was certainly a very important learning, but very stressful to have to grasp NPL and do the project in a short time.
Learning NPL in short time in a DIY way without any help it was very negative and stressful.
bad bad course....
The assignment grading is either far too obvious (whether a required module was injected or not) or completely arbitrary.
Then it was really difficult to follow.
Content of whole program was focused on analytics.
I had to do a lot of self teaching using random resources and I simply didn't have the bandwidth to dig around as much as was needed in order to do well in the class.
When you grade your peers' work, you might notice that more than a few decided to plagiarize code from others.
The videos need to be redone.
this is not an introduction to R programming whatsoever... also it requires a lot of user reading from other sources i.
e.
There's a lot of great information in this course and it's presented in a very good way.
I learned little to nothing while taking this class.
Googling for answers and checking stackoverflow for code is a great way to get tips, but it doesn't teach you the core material.
I'm thankful I audited the course.
I was expecting some thing concrete.
Overall, great instructor, I had expected more "strategy" and "guidance."
Nothing was told about linear algebra, statistics, optimization.
Links to 4 year old articles, websites and TED talks that can be found on Google don't really constitute a course to me sorry.
However, could definitely expand the JS aspects a lot more.
That means in my point of view that the slides are not sufficiently prepared.
nice idea, but too short, shallow and with too few practical examples.
Also a review of some software out there would have been handy
It should be reviewed by either a TA or some kind of application than can verify what you've done.
(p.
s.
Don't want to be too down on it because I really appreciate the free content and the subject material is very interesting, but it could do with a bit more love and the practical application of the marketing concepts described in the course.
You've never built a house before and don't have the slightest idea where to begin.
What's missing is some principles of "tidy data construction" in the lectures.
I left a complaint and this is the response from one of the mentors "john f davis replied: all I could say is keep your personal touch in your GitHub and submit the nonpersonal touch version to be graded.
The Good:The idea of having the lectures in a Q&A style, two experts in continuous conversation about the topic has a potentialThe Bad:That potential is wasted on poorly planned lessons and course contentThe Ugly:Instructors run the Swift code that is written during the lesson and they get a wrong result due to an error in the code.
You hear about it but are not actually taught the right way to make one.
So are other remarkt / piffalls / do's and don'ts.
It was really boring, just reading the text in the presentation.
It can be made in 4 classes not 8.
If you just started JS do not take this course.
I could not finish because videos were stuttered - even with bigger bandwidth - and as a consequence I could not finish the course and the exercises in my limited free time (therefore, only 2 stars).
Therefore, the course is useful for Background Information on SDGs, but not to get up-to-date with the SDG process.
Needs to be more concise.
Nick seems very passionate and trying to reach a broad audience, but overly explaining topics is creating "lecture fatigue" for me.
Topline introduction
No worked examples.
It is just not a good course for a beginner, especially the assignment 2 is hard to understand.
Bill Howe has some knowledge about databases, but little skill in communicating it.
Hopefully "Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark" from the "École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne" (also from Coursera) is good (I know their Scala courses, which are taught by Martin Odersky, are quite good).
There are very few quizzes between lectures and the assignments are not very challenging.
Many of the videos, specially the ones at the end were extremely rushed over.
Contents are interesting and useful, even if the course deals with few topics.
I didn't use it.
Vincent
Unfortunately, the content of the course is poor.
This course will teach you a little bit of statistics and leave you confused with R. The first four weeks are very straightforward.
This is useful also for discuss with other students and how your ideas is viewed.
I think there is a very basic course in his entire length, with more reading lectures at academic or professional level not for a beginner.
I wanted to learn the methodologies of programming and how the statements in HTML, CSS and Javascript interact.
I'm working and I have finished some other courses which were a bit lighter, although longer in time.
Sure you need at least 5x more time to do a good course.
Who cares?
Course material was pretty good, but the lectures were hard to watch.
I made a digital prototype using the knowledge acquired from the first course, but as you can imagine, it is not enough to make our game ideas come true.- The peer review system: the grading is completely non sense, as I said before, the assignments are complex, so it is difficult to show our ideas clearly in a document, without the abilities to make concept arts or something.
This course has a lot of potential and I feel revising the next version would make it so much better for novice program managers
Interesting information, but the presentation of it is poor.
Just the basics.
Many quizzes had in-complete questions (no figures) and there was no corrections made.
I don't think I'll finish the specialization, it's too expensive for such a poor quality
As a physicist, I was very disappointed in his treatment of the important equations associated with the mathematics of music (mentioned as "too hard" to understand).
There was nearly no mention of rhythm and its importance in music, as relates to biology and/or emotion, and no mention of how those rhythms relate to heartbeat.
I am deeply disappointed, but I do hope this critique is seen as an opportunity to create a better course.
The scope of the course is interesting, the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine, but the contents and quizzes are very often off-point.
Yes, there was a small section where they explained crowdsourcing (lol) but interviewing as many people as you can seems to be cryptosaurus approach.
The course can be informative, but the presentation needs some work.
It was often unclear to me what was the expected outcome.
I know English isn't everyone's first language, but if we are paying for these educational materials then it doesn't look very professional for there to be glaring errors repeatedly throughout the material.
Finally, for the peer review you could just mark questions correct or wrong with no way to provide private feedback on what was lacking in a response.
But those are valid for all specialist functionsCouple of remarks:(1) The target audience seems to be the data manager, rather than any executive (C/ C-1 level) of function (HR) dealing with building a data science team.
I hope they add some lectures as whatever lectures are currently available are
Except for the LINEST function, which is very handy, BUT it's NOT TAUGHT in the videos.
Not as detailed as I would have liked.
Problem with quiz week 2
In most cases, I could have learned the Ionic modules just as well by reading the documentation and looking at sample code, which is often what this course felt like.
I am amazed that the 3 branches of US government were explained on the simplest level; this is a middle school & high school topic in the US.
Information strays between ridiculously shallow and unnecessarily deep (e.
g.
The professor isn't that great, and really difficult to follow (high speed, English pronunciation not obvious).
This course introduce you to some kind of good behaviours to apply to social media.
Lessons are starting to feel like not enough time was put into preperation... or like this course was assigned as a project to some students so the professor could make a dollar (like textbooks).
I donot own a Mac nor a iMac and hence I wish to opt out.
Apologies.
I've just completed the course subject to peer review grading.
The video lectures also didn't demonstrate anything.
This course is bit disappointing because of the way it has been presented.
Should cover a lot of dfificuties when the model assumptions are violated and should be for a longer time or having a second course about this theme.
Slides are read bullet point after bullet point without added value.
Instead include it for free with any other 'specialization' you can buy.
Also there is no slides of the material covered what I find not adequate.
The course can be summarized as: "OK, here are some tools that can be used: now read the documentation, Stack Overflow and some papers that we give you links to".
As a result, the lectures are difficult to follow.
To course got tougher every week while the lecture video is not cover everything.
Poor english, hard to follow assignments (instructions spread out over 3-4 microsoft word documents with no links between them).
It was really hard to complete the course as not enough peer reviewers were there.
The objective should be providing us with the basic knowledge, get us interested in this subject, and able to apply those well taught basic knowledge.
Nevertheless, I do feel the course was rather week overall.
There is no way you can possibly do this class in under 10 hours a week.
A lot of talking, little content.
very boring
Might have been easier, and a bit more beneficial, to just read a well prepared set of slides on my own.
A title like "Mathematical Statistical theory boot camp" would be better suited.
I would have expected much more from a course coming from Whaton.
I would probably enjoy that part more if I felt that the information that is supposed to be learned over three weeks was more information than 5 pages in a book.
There's plenty of "what," --- an overwhelming amount of what actually --- but not much "how" or "why.
I feel I would have been able to learn as much by just reading the slides.
CDN course is a bit more visual, with some maps and charts used during the course
Basically, it's a money pit that Coursera is keeping up cynically.
Very informative but very dry presentations.
I hope it will involve statistics analysis in the capstone project.
Too much of common sense stuff and not much in the way of advanced techniques.
After the first two introductions the course was not for me.
I think the lecture is pretty basic and general compared with the other lectures in the Marketing Mix Implementation course.
It could be done all in one day, definitely not worth 80$.
Test errors, no answers from staff on forums, poor narration at times, audio scripts that do not quite correspond to what is being said...
If you want to know why marketers have a bad rep?
Unfortunately, I did not find the course overly engaging and only provided very basic information.
So what I do at the moment: I watch the video and than go to Yuotube to find other videos that deal with the topics in an easier and didactic better way.
Examples of good cousres in my opinion are stats and probabilty course/ and the python coursePS "all of the data toolbox" course seem to have the same flaws.
Of course my knowledge level is low concerning programming ( I am a MD, so hardly scientific educated...).
Lecturers / tutors no responding in time, and the solution provided are questionable, which already happened in earlier courses of this specialisation.
The only video that engaged me was the very last one set in the artifact lab.
No coding practice after that.
What's there is ok, but there is only a few minutes of lecture material each week.
It seemed like the assignments didn't really follow the videos and such.
Worth taking though.
Assignments too easy.
The assignments were too repetitives and don't add variety or feeling of progression through the course.
And the mentors are absolutely terrible at providing guidance.
They also speed through it much like my old math teacher in college whcih caused 73% of the class to drop.
Low quality slides.
One portfolio piece at the end of an 8-month course does not seem adequate to me.
A lot of the lecture material is unclear and does not fit with the content I've learned from other BI books, lectures, and experience.
No consistency, from very easy web design fundamentals to advanced Javascript with no explanation videos to help over a series of quizzes and assignments in week 3 lesson 3.
The content was good, if a little outdated (hence the two stars vs only one), but the course design and delivery were lacking.
The videos were excruciating for visual learners (or really any non-auditory learners).
So, if you enrolled the Web Design Specialization, after the HTML & CSS's courses you will have solid foundation about those languages, you will also grasp the basics of Responsive Design course but you will have to do other JavaScript courses to became a Junior Front-End Developer in the "real life".
Just a quick view of the language.
I wish I could rate this course higher but I didn't enjoy it and despite being 10/12 weeks into it, I'm going to stop now.
This must be improved.
You could explain at least some existing heuristics when having so many control parameters to tune.3c.
I wanted more depth in a more targeted approach to improving my life.
This course is nicely organized and has manageable readings & videos.
However the classmates are extremely aggregating and track you down to give you low scores in order that they themselves may succeed.
The intro video and course introduction strongly suggested using deep learning in the course: did not happen.
The lectures were too wordy and the lecturers tripped over their words too often (which wouldn't have made it so difficult to listen if the lectures hadn't been so wordy!).
Based on the current review criteria, creating two filters would suffice to demonstrate ability to order and get full points for varying intensity for more than 1 filter.
I hope the remainder of the modules are better otherwise I will be extremely disappointed !
If you're brand new to music theory, this course won't help much unless you spend a lot of extra time learning the concepts using secondary materials, google, youtube, and your own keyboard.
Not a class for beginners.
It would be better if he used R while lecturing instead of just talking through the whole lecture.
I got more out of the swirl tutorials than I did the lectures.
Probably only suitable for absolute beginners.
In addition, an extensive list of additional resources (books, papers) is a plus.
I believe that the following sessions will be better than the first one!
Trivial course
I skipped a lot, and didn't finish it.
The course lacks for the practice exersises.
There seemed to be a lack of understanding of the material--even the jokes were taken from the book (without credit to the author).
Not well designed and the professor hard to follow...
I thought Penn University was better than this.
(Though again, why would you first show the commands and just after that explain what's the tool for and where to download it?
The material in the quizzes is not adequately described in the lectures or notes.
Although, it might be just me who thought this way, because in my language design means something totally different.- The course content: this course should be at the end of the specialization.
Very theoretical course they should add some hands on.
Unfortunately as a course designed to teach Rails, it is poorly paced and has a few issues.
I think I'm done with this specialization.
I found the video lectures very choppy and difficult to watch.
After each week you have to complete a quiz.
The material is sort of interesting but there is not much hand-holding.
probably needs lots of practice.
Wish u all the best...
Prof. Taylor's lectures were clear and easy to understand.
This course covers the basic ground about approximation algorithms and would be very valuable for a practitioner, but seems designed for people who already know the materials and is more theoretical than applied.
Lectures are very abstract --with a description of the problem and a formal description of the solution--, there are few examples with step-by-step tracing of algorithms --that is how the algorithm actually works to solve the problem--, and a significant amount of expertise is assumed --so much so, that you wouldn't need this course.
In the end, i am positive I got the correct answers using a horrible coding method and will never see the correct solutions.
Extremely basic.
Problems with the simulator should not be cause for compromising the assignments themselves, there are other ways to address those problems, many of which were employed by students as they competed their assignments.
The assignments were tough and they really tested your knowledge of python.
seem unnecessary, and too elementary to contain any real value, especially when the videos are so brief.
Having said all that, I DO think the people who made it are genuine, and have passion for comics, and comics education, and I'll continue to follow their efforts on that front.
Big gap in difficulty between assignments of first three weeks compared with the assignment of the fourth week.2.
The course was hard to follow and understand.
I don't feel like any new skill was developed in taking it.
I think the concepts exposed are useful and relevant.
Negative: I think it the course could be done in a much more compact way (the introduction and conclusion of each video, which is just music, take together around half a minute).
Most of the things discussed are generic and would apply to any project.
It's a bit ironic that a course about marketing missed its market.
is it the average waiting time?
Do you want teach us to use Processing or teach us to program in Java?
So much was not covered at all during the lectures that the assignments were extremely time consuming.
They are basically reading from a script.
The main problem is that the way the information is presented.
BEWARE: get a much larger background in statistics before applying anything you learn here in real life.
What I really missed was the actual practical aspect where you don't work with command prompt but an much more user friendly interface that is more up to date with current standards.
Hardly a website exists without it and it's clear that Angular will go places.
I realize the point of the lack of specific guidance was intended to encourage us to explore the "making" of multiple iterations of the images.
This was my least favorite of the course.
I am very sorry to say that the course is very poor in english (speaking), too bad you do not teach the course in french this could be useful for a lots of french speaking students and better for the quality of the course.
Authors are too greedy for the course material.
The teacher is amazing, and the content is interesting and makes me want to pursue Law.
This course is "1-dimensional" and not of high didactic quality.
Then there are quizzes and discussions with the topic of the week, doing the possibility at the student to talk about that and post his idea for assimilate concepts and reaching goals of the course.
Didn't like trying to hammer in recommended activities into my lessons, would be better to create new material and use that.
It's easy but these things made it artificially dificult.
At least it's better than the next one in the specialization
outdated, and the guy is really hard to listen to for hours.
Not very much in depth and does not offer complete lecture notes, which are necessary for answering the quizzes...
The continuity and smoothness of the first two Python courses have been lost.
This course is very interesting with well thought-out content that involves the student very actively from the first lesson.
The pace is frantic and the content is superficial.
There were many many boring moments, while management itself is not a boring discipline, it is very interesting.
Anyway I am glad I participated in the course.
Very shallow content - broad, but not deep.
In some ways good, but deeply flawed.
Positive: There are a lot of examples and interviews with people in the field that help to understand better.
The value of this course is the collection of reading materials that can be found in the same place.
If we are not allowed to work on something greater?
** support documents: way too many and not always relevant** quizzes: i don't think that asking us the name of a founder etc.
if you need to join to datasets and have orphans, or you have no foreign keys between two datasets and you need to use fuzzy matching.
Basic validation was also not covered (i.
e.
Does it really matter in which year some paper was written?
Interesting content but the bad English grammar makes it hard to get through and sometimes simply incomprehensible.
This course was not nearly as valuable to me as the first course in the series.
The app crashes and it doesn't seem to cooperate well with Safari so I have to lug around my laptop in order to get through this nonsense.
However the evaluation highly favors videos and it is not possible to pass te course without doing them.
The first 2 weeks were good as professor Peter presented with very brief and sum up the ideas.
It was dry and could've been more global.
You get stuck without knowing how to get to answers;- Some answers to the final assignment are not correct, you check the answer sheet, and the results aren't present in the test!OVERALL:I'd never recommend this course to anyone.
My feeling is that the course creator(s) did not fully prepare and scope of the course materials (i.
e., lectures, supporting artifacts, assignments) required for the available time alloted to each week's topic.
Whilst the presenter, Margaret Meloni, was enthusiastic and pleasant to listen to, the content was very sparse indeed.
The course seems to be useful but the tasks become hell.
But considering that we now have to pay 45€/49$ for the course you will expect more polished videos and quizzes.
Also, there were many that required more than one answer, if you missed one, you missed entire question.
Most of the grades are for peer reviews which depending on other students may never be completed particularly if your first try isn't perfect and you need to resubmit.
The course also requires finishing assignments while needed clarification and explanation is not always provided in the course videos.
Course did not meet any of the expectations.
I'm quite surprised to see the course get such high ratings.
I wish you luck for the future.
Most of the content is available on the MoMA's website.
Would expect more on modeling principles in broader context.
).
Too much time required.
But what I found frustrating about this course was that first the quizzes were often inconsistent with the lecture material, the TA's were less helpful than my fellow classmates (without whom I would not have made it through the course) and the final was an IMMENSE challenge that took over my life for about 1 week - despite the calculation by the instructors that it would take 6-8 hours.
For most of the topics I simply went to KhanAcademy and got it easily there and I was asking myself, why a topic was made so complicated.
Since I wanted to achieve a high grade, I found that the weekly assignments took longer to complete than described.
Sorry, but this is less than "fundamentals".
One of the absolute worst final exams I've ever seen.
As for the assignment themselves, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was a test subject with data being gathered in the back.
I was disappointed with the treatment of the main concepts.
I found this course less engaging than the previous ones in the specialization.
Either the course should not have been offered if no TA support was available or there should have been some notification in syllabus that this session would only have peer assistance with no support from the course staff.
Very basic, we need sequels
at least to work out what they are going to say next.... content is ok so far but delivery is tough to listen to.
As for the final exam, it would be highly desirable for UPenn to provide insight into how they would have solved the last part of the last question as my concern is that there is a whole contingent of people who did this course who didn't come away with as good a grounding on trajectories as they may believe they have
As it is, unfortunetly I can only rate it as a 2/5.
I spent 8-12 hrs on each one just googling and trying to decipher the programming jargon that most responses were written in.
While you can access all of the course content on Github, you are never actually required to use Git for any of the work in the course, and it only shows up as a few questions on the only quiz in the course.
Week 2 they cover Ruby programming and syntax.
It seems that all these types the course is based on are not quite scientifically proven.
The answers to the test questions can be improved significantly.
This should not be a course of its own.
I would have hoped for a more in-depth and scientific look at food and nutrition.
Yes, Prof Covach knows his stuff but basically what we got here was little more than a reading of text from his book.
Unlike the previous course in this sequence, this course provided little to no substantial information.
Mostly they just introduce a few concepts then point you at the Apple Swift documentation.
The course seems to have a staff of one man: the professor of the course rarely replies (even though he did at the beginning of the session) and all the work seems to be done by his assistant, who tries his best, but ends up not coping with all the questions asked at the discussion forums.
Most courses in Wharton's, U. Michigan's and Illinoi's specializations in Coursera, have more video materials per module, than your courses in totality... 1.5 to 3 hours per module in the three institutions mentioned in average per module against about 2 hours of videos on all your course modules combined.
They let you feel that they are just knowledge but you can hardly connect them with food, with daily life or with your health.
Covers only the very basics for project management.
Professor is difficult to follow, often repeating himself and adds fluff that can often be a waste of time
There is a huge gap between the week 1-4 and week 5, in other words during the first 4 weeks, you will learn about just the syntax and idea of swift programming but all of a sudden you have to write a program with over 50 lines of code.
I would recommend to offer more details and more practices during the first few weeks from this course before writing a complicated program.
Tone is unnecessarily childish ("Python is yelling at you").
While some of the information presented was interesting, it seemed oddly biased towards the perspective of highly educated foreigners.
I love taking courses where the instructor speaks at the right pace and keeps you involved.
Really far from the courses by NTU...
quite disappointed.
I have not taken statistics or trigonometry in many years so I struggled.
Not much deep
Also, there's a Google+ assignment.
The material was very interesting but the lecturers were often very difficult to understand.
Do not even dare to take it without first doing Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (excellent starter) and before reading "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville.
It could have been a great learning experience to have a more detailed guide through the construction of a regression analysis, but instead an assignment which was 40% of our grade was put together as an afterthought.
It's more a preview than an actual class.
I DID get a few great reviews, very thoughtful, very constructive.
but did not do justice to that also!
It rather should be called a master class on jazz improvisation.
Though I learned lots of other things I'll no doubt find helpful, I did not walk away with the information I need the most.
I am so glad I did not pay for this course.
The remaining modules should have gone into the concepts of IoT in greater detail and some high level technical info that someone who is just hearing about it can speak intelligently on it without having to develop my own dragon board (next course)
Concrete examples would have been super helpful.
My background is a science Ph.
D. with a lot of computational science experience.
The lectures: Clearly poorly planned.
The course focused so much in interacting with images instead of the HTML, CSS and JS subjects
Your piano teacher talks your ears off with music theory for several hours and then hangs you out to dry in front of an audience in a concert hall.
Some topics that are important, are obviated
I'm confused as to why there was so much emphasis on domain knowledge rather than a good, solid foundation of basic principles.
course starts to be already outdated
The video lectures introduced concepts without any context, making them difficult to understand.
Some of the lectures were boring an difficult to follow.
Had to switch sessions twice.
I didn't really care about the stories from the students or seeing the space for one whole lecture video.
The material is useful, but it would be nice to have a set of notes or a text to go with the lectures.
Brief, high-level ideas.
For example, the instructor talks about project management, public speaking, how to write a resume etc.
Wish they would have made it more advanced.
The course introduces some basic concepts but fails to deliver on the objectives set out in the initial module description by barely listing out most topics through a very narrow, linear approach instead of delivering an actual in-depth explanation and commentary on the subject.
However, I felt that in classes 3 and 4, Python was really an after thought.
I spent most of my time on them not coding the solution, but trying to figure out what was actually wanted and fixing bugs that were in the provided code that we WEREN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO EDIT.
While I really liked the first course I have massive problems with this course.
It is never "self-evident" for me.
Course is not for free and misleading.
too short
The instructor (I believe) assumes that all participants have some background in programming, and since I do not, I have a very difficult time following the examples.
Professors and TAs were not active in the forums.
The final project was too open ended and made me not want to finish this course.
Overall, I would not recommend this course.
knowing how difficult it is to stick to a low fat/high carb diet - which causes me to struggle with cravings, even when I am eating unprocessed organic seasonal local food - I hate to see a low fat diet recommended to people struggling with losing weight.
Then, we get to the quiz with questions where we have to apply real life examples to the structured learning and it's very difficult.
It's almost having someone reading the slides to you.
The course content and the assignments are too far apart.
R labs are too tedious for people with medical or science background!
More in-depth analysis would have been amazing.
After week 1, though, it was not a very interesting course so I considered trying to simply survey most of the videos to gain some more information, not necessarily for any more insight from the Professor from the University of Michigan.
I ended getting more out of the Apple documentation on Swift than I did from this class.
However, the instructors have received ample feedback of this nature and they do seem genuinely concerned with improving the course.
I think there is large space to improve this course to make it more accessible and learnable.
A few of the issues:-Very basic information.
Lots of statistical calculations and procedures.
And the autograder works really bad.
This course seems weirdly balanced between assuming one knows very little about statistics while also assuming one is intimately familiar with statistics notation and terminology.
There must be solution at the end or at least a check point where you can start clean for the next project.
However, the presentation/videos starting from week 2 really sucks.
Not enough material provided to successfully complete final exam.
The video's almost seem to scheduled randomly and a thread stringing everything together in a logical and purposeful way is completely missing.
In fact, one of the links provided simply directed the learners to a youtube video, extolling the virtues of the book wherein the required chapter was located.
However, disappointing that even when I audit the course, I cannot take the exams.
Very limited treatment of the subject.
Not made for the beginners.
Hastily put together.
The use og graphlab is unnecessary and adds a layer of complication which adds no future value to your toolkit.
especially the short haired instructor with constant hand movement and unblinking stare which is quite unnerving...
Rest of the courses in the specialisation were superb, combined with the awesome teaching skills of Dr. Chuck but capstone was quite disappointing unfortunately.
Very limited teaching and contradictory assignments.
I thought the course was oldfashioned, it doesn't prepare you to be a journalist in the digital age, where terms like crowdfunding, search ability, new businessmodels, apps and social media are key factors of success.
While I understood the content of the lectures, discussion videos, interviews, language informant videos, and required reading, the quizzes were far too difficult for a beginner course.
Unfortunately some of the presentation was so poor that it was impossible to work out what points, if any, were being presented.
in some cases I have used external resources to give me a way to achieve the correct result
Very little to do with Excel, mostly focused on statistics with brief overviews of how things could be done within Excel, but very little focus on actual Excel use and knowledge.
I truly hope we could have another instructor in the following courses or the whole specialization would be ruined and so would my interest in database.
Some information presented is plain wrong.
An ambitious sweep across the NLP landscape.
Instructor skims over the concepts.
We are not here to provide free consulting to make you feel or look competent or knowledgeable (as we would for real members of a community).
This is quite devastating for me.
Formulas come out of nowhere and the explanation of the conceptual theory is very thin.
Even worse, the subtitles to the videos are full of small typos and wrong transcriptions, sometimes changing the meaning of a sentence, thereby confusing the audience.
Is the problem solved now - cause I d like to resume the course again.
Ok, the platform offered makes things easier, but if you really want to learn machine learning, you can not be limited to a platform, acting as a robot just using pre-written functions in a black box.
Some interesting points of view and case studies.
The instructor's explanation is not orderly nor structured, and with a lot of 'noises'.
But I have to say that the material the coursed presented is not well prepared.
As a result it's mostly googling and copy-pasting code, which I'm very sceptical if solving issues this way will enter my long-term memory.
It seems more like a weekend lesson than a well prepared course, I mean, it looks that it had little preparation and too much improvisation, therefore, it should be a FREE (ar at least cheaper) certificate due the quite poor planning and execution.
I found only one week interesting and non-biased.
As a non-beginner I am finding this course frustrating and not likely to continue.
I thought this was very very basic
This is very indicative of the classes I had in college, where the class was "here are a bunch of whitepapers/books, read them, and you'll be an expert".
This course will be far more demanding of your time and willingness to fail that the Data Scientist's Toolbox.
This strikes me as a system that could be greatly improved upon!
The very large majority of this course will never be applicable to me.
Unfortunately, the course is young and there were too many bugs to get past Week 2.
I would need a few example calculations of similar problems to what we are expected to solve in the exercises.
As a result, my learning success is not very satisfactory.
The class itself is quite good.
I'd condense some of the commonsense aspects into other sections of the course and eliminate the 20-40 minutes of filler videos.
I would rather see the course continue to expand upon basic programing knowledge so that I can write the code by myself instead of seeking examples to cut/paste all the time.
The material isn't bad, and it does provide some interesting prompts to think and write about.
The course is very fast and the lessons are not enoght to teach in a good way.
A solid reminder to all to be active.
Very basic overview.
I did give it a few stars because I honestly did learn things I did not know, and I understand the value of the application of what was taught for modern businesses.
Reproducible research with doubt is important but videos and what it is discuss are not appealing and beyond that, what are worthen are the projects.
The quizzes tend to be glitchy, and have a maddening propensity to have users type formulas,
Outdated materials, theory is taught and then praxis is tested.
Programming assignments are not very challenging and the course could benefit by adding more content and challenging tasks for those who wish to challenge themselves.
My industry friends said it went too far for what I need in the real world
When I read that this would be a suitable introduction for anyone, I had no idea that what it would really take was a professional programmer (which I am lucky to have as a partner) to fill in the gaps.
Extremely misleading.
Again, there's a definite need for this course.
Often, what the lecture was titled and what was taught seemed totally unrelated.
I have followed 2 courses at the same time: this one and "HTML, CSS and Javascript".
The first set of quiz questions also weren't really relevant to what was in the actual lesson.
You will spend most of your time tuning parametersand deriving matrices that were never discussed in the course.
I really liked the peer review assignments and I think they put pressure on you to achieve the goals and learn from them.
I definitely did not like the multiple answer questions or the last assessment.
I have a hard time remembering what you said.
It took me nearly 8 months to finish the final 3 projects.
Especially the one about the marketing plan was not about plan but about presentation skills.
Low or no help from course instructor, community or google.
As it stands, I'm really glad I did not pay for this class.
I will continue to the next SEO course, because I'm hoping that it will delve more into the technical aspects of optimization, but I am not pleased with the format so far.
Its true that most basic stuff is covered to be fair, but the progression is very rapid.
As I work long hours and other commitments I didn't have enough time to dedicate to study beyond the time needed just for this course.
The way the content is delivered is not interesting.
In answering how to translate "South," the answer should be "nánbian," but when I selected this option, it was marked wrong.
In addition, the course does not seem to have been properly designed
Many promises.
really... strange.
I am disappointed.
Entire thing can be done in about two hours.
Some of the topics covered in the lectures are not covered in the assignments, while other topics which are not covered are.
The topic is really good, but the course does not cover the tools or methodology detailed enough.
If you use Logix as your DAW, perhaps you will learn where something is you hadn't seen before (although the videos are hard to follow as some things are happening off screen or aren't the focus of the video).
In the end, this course was very much a "self teaching" course.
extremely disappointed.
The quizzes barely tested what I had learnt and could mostly be solved by common sense.
by mentors in the forums-- those definitions and explanations should be included in the meat of the class, not as supplemental elements.
And no suggested reading materials at all either.
I have taken multiple coursera classes (Astronomy, Astrobiology, Calculus) and these are by far the most difficult quizes I have encountered.
More time and energy should have been spent on the technical aspects of the Pentaho Spoon program, rather than doing overviews of application pros and cons.
Perhaps another class on what foods do what in your body would be beneficial.
no substantive knowledge at all
I think it is better to combine this course in other courses where you need it.
content 4, thx!delivery 2interaction 0TOTAL (average) : 2
I also felt that a lot of the time of the videos were taken up by telling us what not to do.
Pretty basic course with a lot of 'dead time' not really learning anything about Excel.
However, the professionalism displayed in the course was incredibly lacking.
The actual content (video) looks great, but is unfortunately exceedingly brief, so much so, that it feels like this entire course could have just been a single article.
You could just skip to the quizzes without watching a single lecture and "ace" them easily.
The assignments are also a joke.
Explanation of concept was poor
Terms just pop out of the blue.
If you already know the topic well, you might gain additional insight from a pundit.
I find that these courses always help me a lot.
I am sorry about the 2 stars but I hope you see it as a room for improvement.
The good knowledge teaching should be like how much calorie we need per day?
It's not explained clearly; there's no helpful instruction; and it is very confusing.
I don't feel learning much after the class.
Most of the info are in the reading.
Monotone lecturing style.
The lectures and explanations need more clarity and better instruction quality.
The professor sounds knowledgeable, I have to admit.
I won't deny I learned a lot through this course, but I believe my learning curve can be flatten significantly if there is more class materials available.
Once can easily read 4-5 chapters from book in a single day and can complete this course.
The quality on the videos (sound especially) is often a bit on the poor side.
While some times it is the opposite.
The first three courses in this specialization are very good, but somehow this course are way below the quality of the previous ones.
Number and length of videos in each week are too much while the "practical" information you get are not enough!
All the details are "black boxed" so you can't see what's in the JavaScript functions.
I spent most of my effort trying to solve trivial issues with the sample code and dealing with the auto grader.
Had the course been taught and tested more effectively then doing the weekly assignments would less frustrating and time consuming.
Basically the course is good, but it requires much more work and research because of the poor way its caught and monitored by staff.
Good content
There were several technical issues (no submission button for peer-reviewed assignment, right answers listed as wrong and vice versa in the clips, etc.).
Of course you can learn it all from the Internet - I am taking a Course to get something I will not easily find elsewhere: a good teacher who will guide me through optimal approaches.
Do I focus on the proposed subject of the video or the many tangents about other topics.
In previous courses, I passed quizzes in one try.
For starters, the weekly problem designs aren't very good.
Intro audio for each video is incredibly poor.
Early course videos have too much animation; it’s distracting.
Video 1.3.1- At 4.57 says “Certain jobs and tasks that are not value added are more easily outsourced.
Nevertheless, there are some quite good take aways.
The assignments had no feedback mechanism so I could easily plow through them without any knowledge of whether I did them right.
Too little content for the price.
For example, there are things that the quiz questions refer to that haven't been covered in the course, but you can't even look them up because they haven't given you the necessary terminology to find relevant information about them on google.
I wasn't as challenged as I thought I would be with the Capstone course.
The last assignment was quite frustrating for the following reasons3a.
The course ended and I find myself not a tad upbeater or nourished, or knowing something useful that I did not know already other than about vegas nerves which really did not make sense to end user who are here to know what and how to do things and feel better.
Certificate is expensive!
Not sure this should be a course that is charged ....
on to the next one now.
But Barnes-Hut is too specific and is pretty far from everyday problems developers encounter.
Doesn't go much further then common sense.
Just like business courses, people love to label everything concept or process with some kind of nice sounding term to make it look professional or whatever.
Explanations of concepts are too complex for non-biologist who want to approach the Genomic field
I don't think I will be taking creative writing classes again at Coursera, as going through that broken peer review process and having one mentor being off the wall just wasn't worth my time and anxiety.
Only informative.
Its repeated several times that you shouldn't email the teachers with questions and that online questions should be of a certain standard, its understandable but its a bit patronizing.
A good grammar book is cheaper and more complete.
I would not enroll this course anymore.
JavaScript was very confusing as it did not teach me what each part of the code meant, including the syntax --- and hence I was unable to understand anything by Week 4, despite having listened to all the lectures and participated in the all the activities.
All in all a decent course, but nothing that couldn't have been learnt just by browsing and playing around with GCP trial.
A lot of formulas and theory which if attempted by the casual investor would quickly overwhelm him and reduce him to a babbling idiot with no investments.
One useful tip: Use a 20% drop in "Consumer Confidence" to warn you of an impending recession and sell everything; back into equity when the Consumer Confidence level gets back to its trigger point.
The course is very hard due to the difficulty of the explanation.
The feedback from the student reviews was erratic.
really basic course.
The topic coverage was good.
Honestly, this is my 4th of 5th course on positive psychology and this one will have to make many a fixes to any other that I've taken on coursera.
More readings than practices/exercises.
"That's just the way it is" is never a good reason for me.
All the parallelism is just obvious division of a one big piece on several small pieses, and perfrom parrallel tasks on it.
The instructor kept referring to different authors and books as if she wasn't sure what she was saying was true.
I have not been satisfied with the theoretical content
Provide any needed additional code in standard Python.
It may not be appropriate for a person who already has college education.
The final exam is ridiculous, really too easy.
It can be thought as a week course instead of a four week course.
I hope it will help to improve the course.
Basically it was comprehensive.
I did not like the presentation and lack of practical examples.
The videos do not work, the sound disappears and sometimes vision too.
boring
He tries to split the difference in going through the mechanics/mathematical theory and practical applications.
Content is not well adapted to a digital format.
The course was often confusing and the quizzes came down to a question of trial and error.
Also, this might be the first time they've tried making a peer-reviewed project part of the course, but they did a poor job.
While I did find some of the speakers and subject matter to be of interest, I had hoped for more from this MOOC.
Doesn't provide resources to complete assignments.
Telling students to "go to Stack Overflow" is a serious red flag.
Independent learning is an incredibly valuable process, but this course felt more like a series of challenge assignments to do once you've learned Pandas on your own from another source.
However, for me the approach in this course was very dry and I found the material, goals, and teaching style to be a confusing jumble.
Assignments do not correspond with video lessons.
Video lessons has a lot of teorical concepts that are not usefull at all.
There's a big opportunity to enhace this course.
No offence, but it's true.
The quizzes compared to what is asked in the project is too simple and thus not constructive enough in the overall learning.
Speakers add value to the discussion.
Also, the exams do not match at all with the information provided.
I was **very** put off by the professor's simply opening his book and trying to remember what he'd said there and then, in front of his audience, reduce it down to a videoed talk.
I felt as though I was just copying and pasting sample code.
The content is really interesting and useful.
First two weeks of the course were ok, but after that it became something like JavaScript clap-trap, oriented to playing with images.
But, the curriculum is not at all creative.
Great review of concepts to refresh lean and six sigma, and process improvement in GENERAL.
Expected deeper and more practical information (case studies, maybe a project in a module instead of a quiz, etc.)
I have some html/css background.
Chances are you get bored quickly and miss the one information that was NOT given on the assignment webpage.
In total, it is very sad that this course started so great, but the technical and organizational problems reduced the motivation so much.
Not much details.
audio.
More variety in assignments would be nice too.
very little interaction in the final project.
I wanted to learn the mechanics of machine learning from this course, but it is too complex, and presented in such an arcane manner to serve as an introduction, but doesn't go deep enough to really teach anything useful.
The slides are not at all helpful.
This course is poorly taught.
To give a bit more detail: there were 12 video lectures, 3 assignments that had to be done days before the end of the week to be peer-reviewed, and then I had to peer review others work, while also going through all the assigned reading.
Introduces terms for concepts you probably know, just didn't know it's a concept.
I am left feeling this course needs work.
great first week, I like Fran's First week video, with the puppets and very engaging interaction,the next following 3 weeks are total bummer, It does give some tips for character design (such as what is tangent, or some other design tips), but it feels like a bloated interview and not a class-like experience.
I would like the course to be more dynamic.
Course content and assignments were difficult to follow.
The staff was not very active answering forum questions.
The framework which initially looked hopeful is perhaps not the best framework, as much as is said about this not being "spectator course".
First learning only relying on videos is not very effective.
I guess this would be helpful when having to work with someone who is a drama-maker, although, fortunately, I have not had a situation yet with someone who creates drama.
Just kill this.
This course strayed too far from its origins.
For 10 days students went back and forth debating which one of the two equations that were supposedly doing the same thing but with missing terms were correct.
This course needs an easier way to peer review.
Not worth the price.
The book associated with this course was just like the course itself: shallow and doesn't go in any depth to explain the matter fully and rigorously.
Boring and can't make sense of the presentation / language and idiom use.
This course has great potential as it is an extraordinarily timely topic, domestically and globally.
Udacity’s "Intro to HTML and CSS" and "JavaScript Basics" are way better.
Very basic content.
Although courseware video is well doneAssigment are poorly designed and imbalancedFar too easy on end of each weekLast week final assignment overly difficult and poorly guidedThe sense of progress is very small after completing the courseBiology meets programming from UCSD is better designed on pedagogy and code challenges level.
Can't recommend not worth investing time or 50 bucks
This course may be helpful to people just starting out as social media professionals but if you're already working in this field, you will find this course incredibly dull.
Instruction needs to be short and crisp.
Very vague, abstract ideas in the lectures.
This course and its related courses are rough around the edges.
So far the course is just a tutorial for using Scratch and they're not teaching how to program that is the name of the course.
The focus on relational algebra is a great way to look at data manipulation in general.
The course is very theoretical, there's just one obligatory programming task.
I appreciate the effort of the professor and the University but I found this course extremely theoretical , research is a practical thing that a PR practitioner should know how to do, in practice.
So I had to resubmit.
spaced repetition) nor is there any definitive list for what knowledge should be gleaned from this course.
I think if I had seen a few examples, it would have been enough to understand and keep up.
So, more step-by-step instructions on the mechanics of formulas, would be my biggest recommendation.
But the professor did a superb job explaining the concepts, and showcasing some industry applications of the models.
Thank you for asking.
So no much value for me here.
Too much theoretical.
This course should not be a separate course.
It can be a part of other course.
The quiz questions also seem more involved than the lectures presented and can need some researching as well.
In same cases the video lectures even display the wrong title for the course, or mention lectures that no longer exist in this version of the course!The course has interesting parts (I was especially thrilled when I saw there were lectures about FRP), but its quality is way below "Functional Programming Principles in Scala".
Even some videos are missing.
The quizzes are very confusing too and sometimes I felt frustrated.
I really hope Penn could offer course in such topic for beginners!
I would have preferred if the course focused on getting the results(data) and keeping the statistical analysis to a few (most common) areas.
Too academic.
Finally, as some people already pointed out, the quality of the English of some of the instructor is not good.
I have very mixed feelings after completing this course.
You are lost without any clue.
So probably you can learn something.
Not to do so is shoddy work and doesn't do Coursera or Penn any favors.
In lectures they are talking about simple stuff and then in quizzes they ask you about details they didn't mentioned.
This course is the first course in the Courser's Java Programming specialization, however, it uses JavaScript to teach high level programming concepts.
The teaching aspect of the Craft of Writing is in the four previous courses, this one is basically write a story, get reviews.
The instructor does a very rushed job at explaining everything, constantly giving us tons of information and jargon that is not previously mentioned, and even the examples fail to give us insight at what we need to do and why.
Other than the lectures, no external material is given to help us decipher what the professors are saying, other than a few Wikipedia links.
A bit difficult in terms or using very complicated words....
Too sample , and I would expect more in detail.
I have been in IT for 20 years and expected a lot more in this course.
In my opinion "deviated" & stressed too much on statistics and model building (regression, logistic regression etc.)
As a native Chinese speaker, I find some of the lectures very boring.
Good lectures are clear, concise, and right to the point.
Good teachers make the learning experience effortless and fun, poor teachers make it like a torture.
The course offers no slides.
So many people on the course do not have English as a first language that the marking is often erratic.
I wish the lecturer had t suggested additional material on the topic.
Not a detailed walk through about the specific tool.
The touch on a lot of topics, but do not provide nearly enough information to make it worth staying through the course.
Which is not bad, just of other users information)
Plant-based diets work for some people, but if blood sugar levels, chronic inflammation and/or amino acid intake are issues that an individual needs to take into careful consideration, a high-fat, low-carb, diet with a variety of animal products is more likely to meet their needs.
It is not really attractive.
The final 2% I could have found faster via a Google search than by watching the lectures.
It is not substantiated.
Too mathematical for my liking; would have preferred more balance to this course!!
As someone with a very limited background in statistics, I found the course jumped very quickly from basics to extremely complicated statistical modeling with all the jargon that comes with it.
1 point out of 5 for professor Mike.
If you already know some programming this class is too basic.
The only data available was public data (e.
g.
I filled a notebook with about 40 pages of notes, about 3 of which were useful for the quizes.
I did not sign up for this course to be forced to spend hours in Google, trying to find how to do something, that supposed to be explained in the lesson.
Overall, the course absolutely lacks attention to windows users and is not appropriate for absolute beginners.
The course brings lots of information, but the assessments are not at all creative, so it becomes a lot of theory with little practice.
El curso trae mucha información, pero las actividades no son ní un poco creativas.
In my opinion people could learn the topic more efficiently by reading Stewart's book.
Also, Dr. Peng makes gross burping/drooling noises in the video from time to time.
I found this component to be useful, but it could have easily been compressed into a single week if not a single lecture.
Two stars for quality video production.
Boring
There is an entire video in week three, that covers material needed to complete the assignment the week before, for example.
The assignment instructions and grading criteria are unclear/incomplete.
I am afraid that this course is, to a large extend, a marketing tool for promoting the instructors' proprietary product.
Very basic and obvious things.
However, it lacked critical reflection and depth.
Apart from long running times, I guess that UAVs are not solving ODEs in real time on board, so I think is more interesting a more practical/real-time approach.3b.
This would help to find more information and help.
You might as well just read the book.
I felt difficult to follow the whole program, which might be also linked to my level of English that might not have been good enough, considering the technical vocabulary used in the program.
the instructor doesn't suit me... kind of monotonous tbh.
It really just touches a lot on different machine learning techniques and really just sets the stage for the higher courses.
He takes way too long to get the point across.
Some helpful things are mentioned.
But, where this course goes wrong is value for money - it is very superficial and not worth what is charged.
As noted by others, this is not a course for learning so much as an advertisement for the instructor's own pay software and their other Coursera courses.
I wonder if there is a better mechanism that can be used here3 - TA Support - The lack of TA support coupled with some concern about a history of errors led the students to believe that there was an error in week 3.
This should be a 2 month course or the course descritpion should be changed to make sure you have some statistics knowledge.
Add more detail.
)-As someone who is a paid adjunct I did not value paying for the course, only to discover I'd have to review other students' work.-As a professional I did not feel the need to be reviewed by others, or share (for free) any input.
The course is well organized but I don't think it covered all the basics.
Despite my arguably strong technical background I had to give up at this point since I simply cannot invest arbitrary amounts of time.
I took off one star for how basic, yet drawn-out the information is (it could have been covered in a single week).
I'm also pretty there is more to punctuation than the semicolon and the comma, although I didn't realize how complicated comma placement could be!The professor talks like she's on tranquilizers and it's difficult to do peer reviews when 90% of the class apparently doesn't speak English as their first language.
I learned some things, but this course should really be called "How and when to use a comma".
This woman chatters on way to fast and if you use the slower speed setting on the videos, it crashes every time.
There was some interesting information in here, and I found a few things useful.
I thought the material was presented at an overly high level and was not particularly useful, particularly in the second half of the course.
I understand the topic is massive, but that only leaves me baffled as to why there is room for 5 min videos in this course.
It's a very interesting topic but I had to rely on a text book to understand it!
Many a times I felt my interest waning off.
I ended up using wikipedia for the quiz instead :PI can't use much of the course forum since there are too many posts there and it keep crashing my chrome.
This course gets my 3 stars from the first 3 weeks alone, otherwise it gonna be 0-2 stars.
When going through the Theory course, I often wondered why the assignments are so abstract and theoretical, and I thought that maybe when we come to practice, we will be able to do something with our hands.
The course contents are pretty good, but the suggested time to complete each week's assignment is misleading.
I can read the slides myself (although I have to download it first, since the fonts on the screen are very small).
Some lectures are clear and guide the learner step by step - and then others suddenly assume a level of knowledge and sophistication that is at a significantly higher level and includes concepts that have either not been introduced or have been dealt with in minimal detail.
This course has less use for me as in my day job i create sophisticated websites
He rushes through the hard things and slows through the easy things!
The course was a bit disappointing.
Better care should also be taken with the quizzes - if one looks at the comments or questions posted by some learners, it is clear that we simply don't understand the question, or a question is answered correctly in essence , but the quizz expected more (or less) precision without stating so .
It's all about advertizing: Emily Fox can't stop but recommend Amazon services, and Carlos Guestrin does the same for his Dato's Graphlab Create, which is might be great in general, but absolutely useless in educational purposes.
They could have stated the audience of the course more clearly.
too fancy and the structure is not very clear.
Stating, as if it is a given, late in the course, that there are times when it is okay to introduce a moral hazard.
Practise quiz and assignments perfectly reflects course materials.
Also, professor Muppala is quite funny.
I was expecting a few more technical examples or exercises (mixed with their accompanying definitions).
Takes a lot of time to get to the point.
There are huge gaps between learning materials (videos) and assignments.
Most of us, get that.
There is not much to learn in these modules.
Can't connect on any level with the instructor.2 stars is for the course content.
Sometimes are the explanations in the chapters not sufficient.
It would be helpful to know the name of a proof e.
g.
Whenever she mentioned a reference I wanted to look at, I had to either hope it was on the course reference page (many of them weren't there) or try to figure out how to spell the author's name based on her pronunciation of it.
Either way, I didn't feel like she liked what she was doing.
These were good tips for people in a new business management position, but honestly this was all stuff you learn while socializing with people.
Now it wan't possible and i had to spend way too much time for simple things.
Also more practices would have been nice.
Also, I learned a lot of these statistics in college and the explanations provided in these lessons actually confused me about things I already know.
The course is uneven at best, with some modules providing insights and knowledge and others not so much.
I continue to review it and look up other resources.
There is not much information you would not know before taking the course.
I enrolled in this course hoping to find a balanced perspective about historical foundations for religions and other philosophies.
I would have preferred deepening of one aspect of this topic rather than such a broad approach.
It sometimes felt like the content covered in the videos could have been delivered in a much shorter time.
Although very interesting and very innovative in its presentation I had the feeling this course was an introduction to the Master program at the UNIGE, rather than a stand alone course.
But it has high level
Not recommended unless you absolutely need scheduled assignments in order to learn.
I think that this course was too basic.
Unlike the other two lecturers in this course, this module's lecture is very very bad.
For a intro level course to get a site up and running using Word Press, I feel like it is missing some key information.
The lecture videos contain a lot of code examples, but the various key notions covered are not explained and the assumption seems to be you will look those up in the API.
This course probably deserves 3-4 stars in a better, maintained form, but the entire specialization is not maintained, the lectures have no production values.
Tutor should consider a few more advanced and useful topics.
I had to read it twice before I got this point - we are inclined to believe that evolution is a lot like us - driven by some purpose - but, alas, no.
The material is OK but the grading is terrible.
Lots of powerpoint (just text, no images or visuals really) and the lecturer just underlined the words he was talking about as he read the powerpoint out.
Students are left alone with the material, without any answers to there questions on the course.
Peer review process subject to personal interpretation and leading to frustration for the students.
That's quite unfortunate as this provides a bad experience whereas the course might have been good without that.
I couldn't understand anything from video lectures: cannot understand enunciation not enough detailed, lack of examples related to the assignments.
The explanations in the lectures felt very robotic especially when describing the scripts.
Thanks anyway.
The assistant instructors (likely this guys students) are not as great and the whole thing is amateur night.
This course is in MATLAB, not ideal for machine learning, but adequate for a better understanding of intelligent system implementations.
Maybe the course is OK if you're a beginner in machine learning, but not good.
too many videos and texts.
It gets really confusing, not sure if it's just me.
Couldn´t finish it because assigmnets were not graded.
The course uses proprietary tools for machine learning and data manipulation, making it effectively useless!
Horrible quiz questions.
I wish the course had provided deeper knowledge on this particular subject, specially focused on The Americas.
Dreadful course.
Some people did it, and I can say for sure that I couldn’t imagine the real game.
Maybe you can have a look, not beneficial if you are serious about learning ML.
(2) With regard to management and organizing, I missed the "academic" level (organisational design) nor did it help in setting up data science (where / how to start ?
I think teachers should be available for questions, even if its only through the forum (which they are) Its understandable that there are a lot of students so direct emails might overwhelm but that's just part of the job, we pay for the course, we should also get support when its not working for us.
Overall I wouldn't advise taking this course if you aren't taking it as part of the specialization.
It looks like the authors looked for some real-life example or use case for Combiners and this simulation model looked nice.
The content of the course so far is interesting - and to be fair, I've only completed the first week of this course.
Unfortunately, the combination of multiple lecturers within one part of a lesson (often with highly varying accents, reading verbatim from lecture notes) makes the presentation of the course material come off as very stiff, over-directed, and hard to understand.
I had to analyze the tweet texts for the last graded assignment without using Spark framework (nor any of the other "Big Data" tools explored in the course).
I also found some of the videos by PhD.
Found instructor reading slides only throughout the lecture which was boring and less interesting.
Just a slide reading.
Could I just pass if there's no other submission to review?
Since there are already plenty of ways to do the things our objects were tasked with it seemed like a futile exercise.
The content is good and that is why I gave it more than one star.
First: University of Pennsylvania and we still have to deal with a heavy accent?Second: Couldn't tell if all the vocab gone over repeatedly was standard or made up by the prof.
Third: Stilted, repetitive and boring teaching style.
As a web developer, I found that I already knew about 98% of the information presented.
Not enough information is provided to pass some of the quizzes without extensive additional research into organic chemistry or other topics.
The material, however, seems mostly like common sense.
However you can not submit the Module Quiz without purchasing the certificate, which is quite annoying.
Very little learning for a 4 week course.
Another course, “learning how to learn”, has the best tests in that regard;- the modules are too long.
The lack of response to questions was disappointing and stressful.
Those advices mention in the video is common and that's it.
Quizzes aren't very well formulated and sometimes the correct answer is more of a matter of opinion rather than a hard fact.
More like "Not completely failing.."
Very interesting subject matter, however, sadly brought in a boring way, resulting in my quitting the course.
It sounds like every sentence he says is crucial to understand, which is hard to follow.
When the content is of interest, better to make it longer to improve clarity.
The majority of content is simply common sense, and things you'll know if you've spent any time on the internet in the recent years.
I am also loving the University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization, but since I have been wating for the next course in that specialization for a while, I did Hinton's course in the mean time.
Such as developers... (I am a writer).
Some conditions and some images are missing in quizzes.
Seasoned programmer or other IT professionals are likely to find this course really weak.
The teachers, while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields, fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon.
Some of the presentations sounds little vague and conceptual level like an Advanced Math or, Statistics class.
ProsConciseModular based learningConsCourse needs more auto graded assignments.
Lack of feedback in discussion forums.
Assignment language is not very clear.
Overall I prefer this course to the android specialization but not for the reasons you may think.
The last week's module is very poorly explained, a beginner cannot really understand it.
The syllabus is lopsided and, while organized, not enough thought has been given to the exercise workload.
The instructor sounded extremely comfortable and confident with her subject, and had a very calming and pleasant presence which helped establish a kind of "remote" trust.
More clear examples needed to make concepts clear
Found it boring and pretty irrelevant.
It feels like there was a rush to get the course out and that corners may have been cut at the end.
And as others have mentioned, several very important classification topics are conspicuously missing.
It's a makerspace at best.
I don't think I'd ever pay for a course where evaluations are conducted by people who understand the material no better than I do.
This is the second course in this series that I completed.
This course had too much content in one-run and some of the topic-assignments had too much confusing questions and answers which were hard to figure out made this course a bit a bad experience.
Most of the stuff learned in this course you'd be able to learn straight from the Unity tutorials anyway.
Forums were poorly organized and not well participated in.
There was no forum topic for the honors assignment.
Honors assignment appeared to require unix, which was not stated in the course requirements.
Honors assignment was due too early in the term.
I switched to reading it as a transcript but that generates as a .
txt file which is also very difficult to read as it's not broken into paragraphs.
As a MOOC, I realize that there could be any number of individuals registering for this course using false information and uploading nefarious scripts that could hijack my computer should I download something from here.
Very important materials are explained super briefly.
Felt like much more copy and paste without understanding why you did that.
How is it possible that I try to do something different and better than what I was requested to do and because of that I got bad gradings because it was different even though it met the projects requirements?
I had to fix several of the provided scripts to finish them.
But they are not integrated well.
There's no way to get help.
I expected more content.
Feedback from staff is minimal.
If you have any programming experience you don't need this course it doesn't pay off your time you spend for this.
Discussion forums are helpful only to solve assignments.
There are also quirks that aren't mentioned that other students have to point out.
Lectures are careless prepared.
That means I have to go through every videos and copy his code to my code in order to get the file.
But you need to pay to be able to answer quiz.
It worth it pursuing it if you are interested in joining the capstone project.
This course was more basic and didn't really focus on the many ways of visualizing the data to tell a story.
too complicated
I found a lot of the examples juvenile - 'wearing a robe to the office' or 'stealing things'.
I think that 's more appropriate to whom is already familiarized with the terms and concepts.
In addition to the lagging of 'so, anyways, uhmm...' or just silence, many of the videos are also quite low in quality - especially sound due to bad microphone.
Overall the information was interesting and useful, and I'm looking for Part II.
Assignment is unclear and confusing.
Quizes are too easy, programming assignments still have bugs, and grading procedures cause a lot of confusion.
Professor simply reads the slides to you for the most part, foregoing practical examples in favor of sticking to abstract concepts, and letting you figure out the details.
Could have been more interactive .
The ruby course that I studied from lynda.
com was far better than this
The course is more focus on the statistic and probability theory without giving adequate explanation on how to work on Excel.
I am now at the end of the course but I feel like I learned nothing but a few steps to running an analysis or two ( which I could have done for free through the Galaxy website itself).
As with all Coursera courses, there is no way to communicate with the tutors, which is vey important in such a specialised course.
It was clear instructor regurgitated material directly off of the screen, offered zero highlights to real world experience or issues.
This is not for beginners and should therefore by reclassified as intermediate and above.
Not a lot of new information.
Learn in this course can be frustrating, they will push to the water, you will need to dedicate a lot of time discuss course material with fellow learners, mentors, and instructors to learn how to swim to save your life.
The reading material is great and a definite plus is that it is free.
That was a bit lost on me, mainly because i didn't really appreciate why i should want to (I can understand many reasons, but none felt very close at hand).
Unfortunately I am none of those things and had to cringe my way through the examples, watching the videos at 2x speed.
The course itself is incredibly shallow, even for a survey course, and basically serves as an ad for one of the professors' own products -- Graphlab Create.
I am not happy that I wasted money on this class.
of using peer reviews to pass the class.
This class would do well to have supplemental or required readings and much more difficult quizzes.
I'm about halfway through the course, and I'm really struck by two things:
Would like to have seen more material using git and git bash commands.
I feel like I would have learned more and paid less money taking a course somewhere else or buying a book.
Zero experience talk, no real scenario's/examples.
unable to submit any home work for marks
I took this course for free, but I wouldn't pay for it.
Much expected from this course, but this course is not up to the mark.
I will say that the research and academic readings made available in the course were exceptionally helpful and full of great information, i just wished that that information was presented in a more engaging and interesting way, sometimes more organized as well.
The course is well done and well structured, however it's too theoretical.
I also resent being sent to raw Bootstrap documentation; if I could have read that, I likely wouldn't be taking the course.
It does not now.
The teacher was very lively and engaging, and I would enthusiastically recommend taking an online class with him, but the class is out of date and not what I was looking for.
I do appreciate the introduction this provided, for free, and plan to keep learning in this space, though not in this course sequence.
Questions are really stupid and predefined answers very unclear.
The tasks are very (and by “very" I mean EXTREMELY) long, tedious, boring to tears and to the point when you start to wonder if the authors are trolling the students.
This class isn't very good.
Finally the last assignment required to pass the class has bad directions and covers content not reviewed in the class.
If the instructor or the TA would help out in giving the assignments and implementation in matlab, then it will be one of the ever-lasting courses
This course wasn't well suited to me, being a person with a programming background.
They do provide a lot of useful supplemental material (though often pay-walled).
Initially, I was excited about this course, but I lost interest due to two things.
Classes are ok, but there is no support at all, no advisors to answer your questions, even if you pay for the course.
Sure I learned that I can change parameters within a synthesis program and thereby get various sounds, but that's about all.
Unfortunately you can't possibly finish the course with a feeling of success.
However, uniqueness isn't unique among nations; all nations are somehow unique.
This made watching the videos frustrating at times.
I think it is not worth 49$.
Explain to me the most common mistakes people make with each of the different type of networks as securities.
I understand that all courses should have an introduction and presentation of basic concepts but I don't see myself getting very far with this knowledge of research.
There were many times the professor seems to be saying that evolution is somehow willful.
This course was not interesting compared to the others in the specialization.
I feel like there should be more teacher involvement within this course.
Too many quizzes after very short classes and on topics of absolutely generic things.
Basically not much content.
But for a course that is supposed to teach you how to analyze data in excel, there are actually very few lectures that actually show you how to do anything in excel.
The information is comprehensive and very valuable, but the delivery is very lacking as a MOOC.
I've only taken 2 classes with Wharton online.
In such a way that the concept worked is very simple, but if you have no experience on the software or code you can have a hard time to complete the assignements with irritating details which are not explained at all in the lessons.
The instructors are funny and try to keep it light, but it certainly is NOT an intro level course.
Course videos don't seem to follow any kind of logic or purpose and tests are based on highly subjective content, but are not prepared to deal with the subjectivity of reviewers (i.
e.
Too many references to a book said to be not compulsory.
In the final exam right answers are not given.
The course gives you just a smattering of the subject, nothing that you can apply with confidence on the job.
Very generic advice although the interviews with children's writers were illuminating and helpful.
Probably a lot of better executed Machine Learning courses out there
I thought it was poorly organized and focused too much on trivia and not enough on motivating and contextualizing Ancient Egyptian civilization.
The module on image processing should be reviewed as after some point it becomes sort of boring.
Con:(1) I feel I spent most of the time learning graphlab.
For an institution like the host institution, this is odd.
I know it takes a lot of time to prepare this material, but clearly that last effort for quality was not done.
Too simple and lack of practice exercises!
Not very interesting
However, this course could be so much more.
and simply providing the answer as a constant value, in order to receive credit for particular questions.
Course was to easy and nothing new in it not as the description that it has algorithms 100000 times faster than google.
I think the content was quite interesting; as someone new to marketing, I was really looking forward to the lectures and exercises.
("You don't want to be too far to this side, but you don't want to be too far to the other side, right?")
It's like they're looking at a monitor or camera on the side, so it's like he's talking to somebody else.
So in summary, basic concepts and information are there, yes.
And the concept are so easy I am wandering if they need to be teached at all.4) The exam are just sloppy.
If you don't mind that, it's probably not a bad course.
I thought most of the discussions were "____ needs to do this, _____ needs to learn to do this."
Not in-depth at all, mostly summarizes movie plots.
the examples they use assume we know basic stats when likely most of us are a bit rusty.
Still, even the free access permits you to use all of the materials minus the major graded assignments.
I could have easily googled these terms and have in the past.
Some good content.
)Some of the autograder feedback is so terse as to be downright infuriating.
3/5Yes, for the most part, though the lecturer sometimes gets mixed up and uses terms like "class" / "object" the wrong way.2) Can I generalize from the material to other applications?
Unfortunately, there was no interaction in my iteration of the course, or any apparent involvement whatsoever, from any TA's or mentors.
Furthermore, some of the quiz questons seemed incomplete or confusing.
It's hard to get excited about a topic when the presentation is this dull.
Bugs in the new interface and quizzes weren't really addressed.
Try Open Office which has a "PowerPoint" type presentation software if you are looking to save costs.
For me personally: way to complex and brain rather than output focused
The content wasn't concise enough.
This might sound petty, but kuh-rooze-zel for the word Carousel?
Very short.
I got halfway through the first week before deciding to un-enroll.
I think I'd rather have a course that asks, why do we wear what we do when its made on the other side of the globe, is that the best for the environment?
This course is good but TOO FAR from the real content this specialisation look for (or at least, I was expecting).
Parts of the course feel like a "Getting started with Graphlab" tutorial.
Not enough pathophysiology or treatment details for me as a healthcare provider.
I have passed tens of courses on Coursera, and this one is by far the worst.
Not worth the money it requests.
I am confess that, as much as I was looking forward to guest lecturers, I couldn't make it past the first three.
I would have been upset had I paid for it.
There is a lot of reiteration and some texts are so similar with one another that more than once I thought I was doing again the same section.
I would highly recommend anyone who is new to JavaScript to take JavaScript class first and then to start this one.
It is too theoretical, and from very simple concepts makes rocket science.
Still interesting content.
The good thing is that it includes very modern approaches to data analysis and new packages.
Additionally, the quizzes don't seem to test for real-world BI knowledge, rather they test for the ability to interpret the instructors fairly unique views on some BI topics.
Short, superficial, and sometimes even condescending towards people with ASD.
2/5This module spends a lot of time on C before you get to Objective-C specific material, so you don't get much Objective-C.
The lecture quality should be dramatically improved.
Otherwise the Course was great and the information was definitely well put together.
too basic, wish they had more content
I want it to be more exciting.
It felt like an informal conversation between the instructors with one of them repeatedly calling different aspects of Swift "cool".
Far too easy
It seemed to move way to quickly without a good explanation of how to use the script.
I could see asking for money if you went into more detail information regarding each lesson, but just telling me what each term means and then pointing me to a website, then asking for 50 bucks is kind of cheap considering no in-depth information was ever given.2.
Mistakes during the videos are only corrected in its review.
The lectures were very informative and clear.
I like to get a certificate, but it is not necessary and spending too much time is a waste on my time.
As analogy - imagine a cookbook that says: in chapter 8 you'll learn how to cook pies, but here in introduction let me tell you how to add baking powder in them.
Setting up the development environment is sadly dated.
I strongly believe this specialisation cycle should actually take one or maximum two courses, not 5 (with the capstone).
Not much to do with the DragonBoard.
I concur with others of a similar opinion on this course:Assignment instructions/criteria differ from the grading rubric criteria.
I enjoyed that aspect.
And hope this course can add a little bit material on statistical programming or machine learning session in the future.
I think it is quite good and the assignments are also challenging but you learn a lot.
Anyway thanks a lot for the course.
It is my opinion that the course needs to be taken offline and redone.
Note: Apparently I took a prior version of CCC parts 1 and 2 so my comments on those two courses may or may not apply anymore.
Also, there's way too much material crammed into four weeks, leading to a lack of depth.
The instructor was not very engaging and by the end of the course just seemed hungry and ready to be done.
There are many, many 1 and 2 minute videos, these could've easily been combined.
Without a comprehensive background in thermodynamics (which I do not have), advanced mathematics and statistics, this course is extremely hard to impossible to follow.
Its not maintained by anyone, and the people taking this course had to find ways to overcome QSTK bugs to be able to complete their assignments.
And lastly: the exercises.
; what does interface mean?
Also, one of the required videos proved helpful, and a couple of the optional Ted talks were "must see's" for anyone involved in the non-profit sector.
It was problematic that there was so little direction with respect to how one might access the required reading materials that were not linked into the course syllabus.
Nice overview of Galaxy, but does not really provide enough information for a beginner to start using it without additional resources.
I had better things to do.
The way the tests accept the answers can lead to a very frustrating experience.
2 days?
Not worth the time or cost on it's own, unfortunately it's required for the specialization.
I had fully intended to participate until I saw that.
Especially the Technion ones.
Cannot believe charge me homework
The topics were covered very quickly and not in very much depth.
It may be worth enrolling just to hear Odersky's elegant lecturing at work once again, but if you're interested in the core concepts, I would highly recommend picking up a highly rated book instead.
I have no intention of taking any more at this point, not from these authors.
Content was good, but occasionally VERY hard to understand the lecturers' English.
Must do better.
A lot of calculation errors and incorrect answers
bad explanation and poor introduction
He, too, was not happy with what was in this unit.
I did not get the much needed support when my R studio installation failed or when installation of libraries failed with error messages.
Although i was deeply interested in this subject and would look forward to the revised version of the same.
As the name says this is just an introduction in Social Media, so if you are already using it you don't have much to learn from this one.
It is confusing and not well explained, and the quizzes are too short and badly written.
too brief to learn
If that's more successful now I would start the next parts of the specialization.
Thank you for an answer!
Otherwise, not very useful.
You'll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve.
Good intention but the programming assignments were much much harder than what was covered in the mostly theoretical lectures and the more practical but not as advanced swirl exercises.
This is not done by the professor.
No, I will not be recommending this course or any others by this Professor.
It can improve a lot.
Even if someone memorizes the details like specific names and dates, for how long he/she is going to keep it in mind?
Furthermore some of the commands they present are deprecated and cannot be used anymore.
Sometimes that is good, but other times a guide geared to the course would have been better.
The material could be exciting but the presentation is dull.
Visuals were not great.
I would consider the majority of the content to be common sense.
I didn't learn a lot from this course.
The material is nice, In this sense, I would have expected to 'default' to sci-kit learn and offer using graphlab create as optional.
GitHub has changed and doesn't match the videos so any information delivered doesn't help get someone up and running.
I just hope the team do not give up, but improve this to be one of the best courses on Coursera - it can well be!
As it stands, the quizzes had mostly relevant content, but the lessons were anything but engaging.
I highly recommend to start visual explanations of what you want to achieve instead of throwing formulars at people and confuse them.
// After week 2 I resorted to just reading the pdf of the slides and stopped watching the videos.
I'm not impressed.
It tries to cover too many topics.
The delivery should be improved.
This also happened with the SWOT Document...
which I don't think was even mentioned in the lectures at all in-depth.
For the price paid, I could have found most information on Wikipedia...
Some necessary prerequisite should be at least provided as reading materials.
At one point, I lost all my work because of this error.
Too little information.
Even though this course covers a lot fundamentals for introduction to algorithm, the course itself is not designed as good as I expected.
The broad stroke videos from week 3 kind of give you an idea as to what each piece of code is doing if your working from a template, but the assignment feels obfuscated when trying to build it from scratch.
A major issue also comes from a third party website they require for completion of the assignment (and that requires separate registration to use).
We were not given notice that this would happen.#disappointed
The most important part of this course is peer review IMHO.
The course material can not be downloaded and can not be retrieved or used as reference after finishing the course, unlike other courses I have taken with Coursera, but in other University.
This course is VERY abstract and I find myself rushing through the videos to get to the practice/quiz so that I can trial and error my way through the project..... hoping for the best.
This comical man makes me very annoy.
Lot of considerably complex and dry (accounting and statistics!)
The peers do not have a "higher" knowledge level to make an evaluation of the alummni.5) It is not possible to take the quizzes unless you " upgrade" .
Just my opinion - not enough information about R tests and program, what is this, basic details for testing and code, no details for Mac-users.
Designed more for a child learning about poetry for the first time.
He needed to put some effort and thought into understanding his topic from the point of view of an audience that is inevitably very, very different from the one he had in mind (if any, in particular) as he was writing the book.
It is fantastic that Coursera is open to everyone, but when your grades are based off of clarity of language, it gets tricky.
Also I think the videos could be better
Very poor teaching
If they intend to target a PhD audience, this is clearly a drawback as some of them might know the same as you do.
Its too easy.
In all honesty, if I didn't have prior experience with writing, I oftentimes wouldn't have any idea what was being discussed by the professor.
The workaround I've used is to print french translation or english transcription and read it, trying to guess which part suited with which slide ...
For a non-free course, it's not really professional ...
It was more of a description of UCSD's research than of the "future of the energy".
I feel that the duration (5weeks) for this course is way too long.
The material is presented thoroughly and the second piece of peer-assesed assignment is pretty well explained.
However, I think the course material proposed in the outlines should be more diverse, by adding complementary video lectures, research articles and book extracts in every week, since this was proposed in this way just in fifth week; course 5 of the specialization program is a great example of that.
The first piece of peer-assessed assignment may improve by being clearer and giving the opportunity to the learner to express his/her own ideas, instead of request a summary from this.
The course material itself wasn't bad, but the execution just seemed a little unfinished.
The explanations are not clear.
That's a waste of my time and yours.
In light of R or Python, doing statistical computing in excel is really time consuming and backward.
Here are the 5 things we're going to cover.
The title is misleading since "at scale" led people to think that large scale data processing platform such as spark and nosql databases will be central to the course right from the start2.
Requests for help fell on deaf ears, except for those of co-learners.
A small, but annoying, flaw was that the professors were simply reading text from their slides, for the video component of the course--with an additional word thrown in, on occasion, for good measure.
Practical tasks from hadoop are very easy and they show nothing (just how to navigate over hadoop file system.
This might be ok, but the difficulty of assignments should follow; instead, they can be relatively hard; newbie programmers will probably have an extremely hard time solving them, considering that many of the problems they will encounter are not treated at all in the course.
The course does not focus enough on what differentiates R from other languages: just a few videos on data types, *apply functions, and a tiny little bit of scoping (very unclear).
You've only got one day at work with your friend, so be kind enough to humor them with a very cursory explanation of what sorting is about, but you can't really teach them much in such a short time.
The title is misleading .
This course has a little to do with excel , you could get some mathematical information but I do not think you will master anything
I believe not enough foundation was given to make people use the Galaxy tools consciously.
In terms of how the course was presented, I liked it compared to the usual lecturing style; however, the content was below basic for someone in the field of health.
But then you get to the final project...
All of the sudden you're plopped onto a construction site with your hammer and saw and a pile of wood and told to build a house.
The main reading "eMarketing" was good but all video content and assignments were directly from the "eMarketing" guide by Rob Stokes.
There were lots of repetition.
There were several queries about the assignments on the Discussion forums most of which did not elicit any response from the teaching staff.
Toolkit is important.
What I didn't like: This course, as most of Northwestern courses, is excessively short in video lectures per module.
nothing interesting here.
The classes are not practical, and the voice of the teacher is very monotone, boring.
Not a lot of time is spent on any of the functions of F. Swirl helps but not a lot.
It did cover the topics well , however, in-depth understanding and newer concepts (for eg.
The course was ported to the new Coursera platform in a amateurish way without any testing.
Overall very bad use of the medium available.
Invest your time in reading "Deep Learning", its challenging but at least its got a very logical structure and style.
If I got stuck on a Friday night and couldn't find an answer myself, I had to wait until Monday to get a reply from an instructor or teaching assistant.
The contents and quality of the video lectures are great.
The quality of the supplementary materials (like the quizzes and the Matlab code) provided by TAs for the assignments are very poor.
The course feels as if its target population is lower-level undergraduates or the general population.
I think it is too expensive!
I like Mr Balch but to be honest I learned next to nothing.
even for a jump start.
this course needs more material and more practice.
The Sim's...
A pity!
Doesn't give much insight into data science.
So the best method to learn programming is to use step-by-step demos.
This probably means I can't get my cert until the next session starts - if I'm lucky!
There are very few examples to clarify and illustrate the different topics of the course, but what's worse is that the assignments are almost completely divorced from the instructional videos; the assignments and especially the final project are much more complicated than anything presented in the instructional videos, so there is no knowledge basis from which the student can operate to complete the assignments/projects satisfactorily or smoothly.
I am extremely dissatisfied and wish I hadn't paid for this specialization.
I would really appreciate it if there was something about this topic in a time management course.
Forums prompts should be shorter and clearer by highlighting a single key question instead of a bunch of these as happened.
I wasn't impressed.
forcing them to provide feedback instead of giving points arbitrarily).
However, the quizzes contain some questions that have no apparent relation to the content of the lectures, and some questions about details of the presented algorithms which are explained in neither the lectures, nor in the papers from which the lectures are derived.
It was OK.
I would expect an online course to be more interactive, have more videos, and more varied content.
how to start a data science project if all there is is unorganised data and the wish to do 'something' with it.
It is clearly a very important aspect of Data Science, but the assignments were more complex than the given course content.
After having completed some other jazz courses I realized that i had no chances to learn anything here since the theory is not explained sufficiently.
IMHO the video should supplement the written material, i.
e.
Very little thought seems to have been put into the lectures.
The saving grace is that the course is just 4 weeks and can be completed in a fairly short amount of time.
I don't like the fact I pay money for other people to "assess" my work when half of them don't even read my submissions properly.
Apart from being more reliable and less frustrating, I think the learner can really get more out of it.
This course needs to have better quality checks to ensure needlessly lost time is minimized.
The videos did not teach anything that was going to be on the quiz so it was like answering 5 questions at random using google.
At best case you are taking a guess and at worst you are learning bad habits or missing out on what should be in it.
Very basic stuff.
In an online forum it's important to actually address concerns.
Approach over-simplistic.
I have to say, I am disappointed in that I feel there is little to no interaction here between students and instructors/aides.
TBH this class's experience is not good.
Another example would be where the lecturer said that "stand-up meetings" mean no body is allowed to sit down?!
Also it was said that the other course specialization start soon but it seems they don't and I paid for the full package....
Instead I tried to load the files from my local drive, which worked, but not for the grader.
There is nothing you will gain from this course that you can't get in a single 1/2 hour youtube video instead of 100 2 minute videos here.
Vastly concerned with the esoteric minutia, ideas, and meanings assigned by others regarding photographs which most often aren't even closely aligned with the original artist's intentions.
A brief few mentions of how photography has changed over time with advances in technology and development of new techniques was mildly interesting, otherwise this course was predominantly meaningless.
I did not take any quizzes or otherwise have my knowledge tested on the material in the second half of the course.
Why is there no gallery here?
Perhaps some practice would have been in order?
Replys that avoid directly addressing concerns sound like automated messages.
Speaking of beginner level it is good until you are learning css in it .
the assignments where you have to project a logo, or cube, when the program gives you the location corners in a file, which will NEVER happen when you use your camera; finding that position is a pre-requisite of the entire program)
This will probably be the worst course in the specialization and for good reason.
If you love to see a couple of entertaining movies about robots and some interesting concepts about them, grab some popcorn and take this course, because, hey, it’s about cool robots!
It takes several hours.
The lecture videos are full of code that simply does not work in the real world and help from staff takes literally days to get(and not just over the weekend).
and the course is focussed on promoting "graph lab" proprietary package of the course sponsor.
Really dense and little explanation.
i didn't really enjoy this course
Too easy for financial spreadsheets
Feedback for the developed business model is missing and thus sigificant added-value cannot be captured.
The module needs to be shorter.
But sometimes I only got two reviews instead of three, and usually the reviews gave no criticism.
The success of an organism depends on its survival in the habitat, etc.
This is contrary to most of the other Coursera courses where you can.
I founded so basic, I didn't feel engaged to continued.
Material taught doesn't match material tested.
People were trying to decipher the wording of the questions, not learning how to code.
almost nothing.
is it a course.
so frustating after one week.
not details.
not what I expected for a machine learning course
Materials were reasonable, but the slides for the course were not made available, no one answered questions on the discussion forums related to the course content and the only additional resources provided were to buy a book from the instructor...
Not new to programming.
Some rambling videos that could really do with editing.
Even though the drone trajectory seems to fit perfectly the planned trajectory, you might not pass the exercise, and you would get some clueless messages telling you the final position/velocity is not correct.3d.
Quality of the course is also not that good.
Students are left to their own devices.
The testing in this course is horribly crafted.
I liked the course, but it was not very well organized.
I think the teacher was very welcoming, but the content was less than enough to answer the quizzes.
Its use is therefore limited for the practitioners that want a foundation on the free Python data/ML capabilities.
I would not recommend this course to my colleagues.
I was very disaappointed by this course, in fact a bit more so than by the "Unwritten" course that has run concurrently with this one.
Insufficient explanation of math concepts required to fully understand lectures.
Also, it was unclear why the focus was on CLASSICAL music, since so many examples come from other artforms (e.
g., Ai Wei Wei) and I'm sure the discussions would be richer if they considered popular music as well.
Should just be called 'Introduction of Java for absolute beginners'.
While the content of this course was presented in an engaging way, the assessment task lacks context.
Neither am I excited about starting the lesson each week because there is no real world problem/or data set I'm continuously practicing from.
Comparing to Andrew's ML course, this one is really bad.
Time for an update.
one week's assignment requires a shocking 10 peer reviews to pass but when I took the course, there were only a few submissions).
I had to resubmit my assignment due to a student that choose to give me 0's when the other reviewers gave me 5's.
It's a bit disappointing.
I was expecting a few more technical examples or exercises (mixed with their accompanying definitions), but I will check another course that is not so academic.
This course was not at all what I was expecting it to be... which could be both good and bad, depending on your own perspective.
Swift syntax is also very clean compared to Java syntax.
A detailed example showing the strengths of this language would be better.
For example, one quiz asked what type of question would "tell me about a time" be, and in the video it literally said it was a behavioral question, but that was marked wrong in the quiz.
Sometimes data is presented in misleading ways to make the harm from drugs look greater.
But most of them are simply useless.2) It's too long.
That would at least be worth 50 dollars, for some real world practical use.
the presenter's accent is constantly impeding instant recognition of what he's saying.
No syllubus or suggested reading material was available until the course started, which leaves little time to decide on the value of the course or to acquire the reading materials.
This course failed greatly to balance the workload by week.
),5) About this project, the instructions are messed up.
In the end, I finish it because it was my first specialization, and I was lucky enough to do the interesting one at the beginning, so I feel compelled to end it, but really, I am not sure It was worth my time.
The topics I think are still relevant but the tools are not.
There were some graded assignements that dealt with things I have never heard about and I completed it without even looking the lessons videos.
On the improvement areas, I however have a few to list.
Very disappointed that the assignments are not part of the f
Explanation is
week 4 was very good.
A grader that only tells you "your answer is incorrect" does little to help you learn from mistakes.3.
Now is 2016.
If you decide to take this course, be sure to do the swirl exercises so you get a feel of how the R functions work.
While this forces more independent learning, it also makes it so that this course isn't really much better than free online tutorials.
The mystery cases on which we worked during the course were never 'resolved' or explained in any way, which would have been nice after the effort that went into them.
Also one of the quiz questions was simply wrong.
I would only suggest it for getting familiar with the estimation "keywords and terminologies" or for someone who wants to brush up his/her prior knowledge in estimation.
The course is very much focused in the method of DCF, but there is a lack of information regarding how to apply it to startups in practice.
Terms such as intervention, package, therapy so many terminology.
The videos just gloss over the materials.... No comprehensive lecture notes or standard textbook and lessons are too squeezed.
Material is very basic for anyone with even the smallest amount of programming experience.
Not that helpful for me
If perhaps many types of structures had been emphasized or structures had been pointed out as optional, this would have been mitigated, but the time period is so short that there's no time.
Which version is followed here?
This meant that finding the solution was based on guesswork rather than considered thought.
I encourage you to have more links outside coursera and point out material where i could deepen my knowledge about the topic.
Also some times this course didn't explain differences between different ways of saying the same thing.
So many equations presented without explaining why these things work or how they are derived.
Creates a bit of a feeling of a kindergarten festival.
As a result it provides a shallow introduction to many topics rather than deep coverage of any one topic.
If you are in the 'game', you must 'play' it better...
I hope you will accept my critic as constructive and positive, not as negative.
Although I'm only the first week, there are two main comments I'd like to make.
Firstly, why are the lectures sub-divided with the ridiculous, overlong, and irritating introduction for each section.
Course lectures are good, but many quiz questions are out of syllabus.
They very very complex, to be sincere, none of the assignments I reviewed were full, I gave max grades to many because I think the person tried really hard to make it.
I did not enjoy this course as much as I did the first two in the programme.
The course is really just spitting formulae from the dissertation "Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors" by Daniel Warren Mellinger (easily found using search engines).
I did this "seven week" course in about 2 hours.
Each video is mostly non-focused talking, very few examples and so you don't learn much.
By comparison, the other class has a lot of videos, each video is much longer and goes into many examples.
If I already know what you will ask me, which kind of knowledge are you supposed to teach me?
The course should cover less materials or be longer to be effective in teaching.
Could be more clear about how to calculate period and latency.
I also found the lessons rather superficial, did not "dive" into the heart of this great civilization.
The first week was a bit dry but improved the following weeks.
Overall - I'd give the class a C+.
boring assaignments
Too much theory, not enough practical exercises and too few examples of how the algorithms work.
This course barely touches C programming.
Overall, this class does seem to be a good choice for a "refresher" course if you already have some experience coding in R, but be wary if you have little to no programming experience.
I don't feel this course is always very clear.
I can't imagine doing that to a student of mine, a peer, or even a stranger.
I'm taking this course series to learn the material, not to be tricked of failed on a quiz.
2.
So if the lectures don't stretch me, I find my money spent unwisely.
Discussion Forum provides some level of help but you are basically on your own.
Very challenging to come up to speed with Natural Language Processing techniques if you have never taken any class about it.
My recommendation to JHU and Coursera is to add a separate course for NLP where you cover all the basics and then have the Capstone.
However, if you dont have Adobe Ilustrator nor plan to buy the Certification, it is a little bit too short and basic.
very poor content on Java Script.
I've had to stop, sadly.
Very basic course without much in depth explanations or insightful matter.
I hope this course is worth the money i paid, I'm starting to regret paying for this.
The instructor is not very good when compared to the others that are involved in this specialization.
Not sure how I would make it better, but I felt like I was learning from googling more than from the course.
It's odd nobody on their end checked those the week the material was taught.
The videos were not very professional.
Depth of the subject was not there.
Very introductory and generic course where personal branding as a subject was merely cursorily touched.
Oracle VM is very heavy and slow to use on regular laptop.
However, the lectures are much longer than they need to be, and filled with unnecessary commentary.
Sure, you will see lots of really cool things -- like AngularJS, Grunt, Bower, etc.
I found the course videos quite dull and uninteresting.
There are some problems of the organization of the course.
This course feels like a bad news anchorman reading the teleprompter.
Poor.
Course crammed with unnecessary details (loads of CSS "decoration" properties that one may test on it's own), without focusing on CSS fundamentals, such as page layout strategies, float-based layouts, element positioning which, in my view, are discussed only very superficially.
I'll forget 90% of discussed "decoration" properties in a few days but when I think of CSS paradigms - a structure that can be later filled with easily forgotten/easily retrieved "decoration" properties - that I'll take with me "for ever" out from this course.... sounds empty.
Still slower than I would like at 2.0x speed.
the test is terrible and teacher is just reading the ppt.
I found that there were at least a couple of places that were ageist and overly simplistic in talking about retirement planning and there were moments that there was a paranoid anti-government vibe that I found off-putting.
If you don't have the skills to complete this course, you will not complete this course.
The whole course is basically a short topic based phrasebook being read-out and over-explained in English.
1 month is not enough for this course.
I feel there are many more topics to discuss for this course.
I have to play back rate to x1.5 normal speed.
While it is not very hard to learn R Studio (even for people who are not comfortable with coding), it is very difficult when people get stuck.
Very boring lectures, too!
Would rate higher if the videos were improved.
Useful information about nutrition, I would've loved to learn more about that.
Too many theory and reading from lecture slides.
As I said at the start, I really love Dr. van Lent's teaching style.
It may be a 5 weeks course with a more slow learning, because we see some tags in a second and it passes.
In many cases, the practice quizzes were less helpful.
It was little boring when this type of course should be super exciting
We are given inadequate information in the videos, and no other resources, to write a program.
Not very much learned.
I learned how to use the
Moreover, the teacher's voice and tone did nothing to make the content live.
a student forum might be helpful, too.
application of some formulas is not clear, leading to errors on quizzes.
Sort of a rolling homework Ponzi scheme.
Topics were basic but good, but I cannot understand why a physics undergrad with no screen presence and mispronunciations was asked to lead this course instead of the MBA professor who was advertised.
If possible can you please change the videos and also the script.
If you are like me, however, and looking for a course that will focus more on artistry and practical real-world application, then this course is not for you.
The main issue I have is probably with the Coursera structure itself.
And yes, I know it's free, and I know you have budgets, but 3 universities can't rustle up a graphics undergrad to help out and call it an internship??
It is necessary all the time to separate useful information from enormous amount of information about her private life.
I'm disappointed, I don't feel like I learned much!
Wasted time.
If you are looking for a challenging course this is not for you!
Seems more target on traditional statistics than machine learning.
The content was interesting, but the quizzes didn't relate to the lectures very often.
Almost a useless course - ML overview using KNIME which gives no insight whatsoever.
If the recordings worked, I am sure it would be a very fun and interesting class.
I only spent about an hour a week completing this course, and I believe that you can't learn something by only spending an hour a week on it.
It's enogh to write merge sort with several threads to get the main idea, which is proposed here.
Proprietary.
I am very frustrated by the disconnect between the lectures and programming assignment in this course.
Week 2 on streams in my opinion was a very strong week and well worth time and effort.
I create online education that is nothing better than Powerpoint and a talking head, lack of budget, but at least the head doesn't make people want to drown themselves in a melting glacier.
The interviews were boring and there wasn't enough content.
If you are seriously interested in writing, this class will have little value for you and I would recommend skipping it.
The course really needs some improving!
I struggled to understand the lectures and reconcile it back to the quizes.
I did learn a lot about the internet in general though.
I received evaluations that doesn't tell me much or evaluations that doesn't make sense.
I say this as someone who went to Duke and has taken similar classes at Duke!
professors caffo and leek go way too fast and are completely monotonous.
Unable to download certain materials and no spontaneous reply was made
Rather, this course is a general overview of what research is.
AND, the instructions are for MAC!
This was my least favourite course in the the Creative Writing Specialisation.
I didnt find it very usefulIt maybe useful for professionals just starting work but if you are in a managerial or leadership position struggling to manage work it didn't seem useful.
Very basic tips and tricks to manage life
The teaching team does not seems really organized : just a quick view of the language, no slide, just someone who is presenting code on screen, no real support on the forum from the teaching team.
This course feels rushed and skims over a lot of things without detailed explanation.
We are getting basic ideas, but going through all the information structuring the ideas too quickly, with NO examples / limited examples, which is what will teach us the most.
Some good concepts and stories, but lacking in specific techniques.
The course was a bit mixed in terms of its quality.
The lectures were very short, the contents are too simple and general, does not have the deepness and comprehensiveness for professionals.
There isn't any test and the lectures are very boring.
Overall, not really worth the money for a paid certificate.
I was expecting the capstone to be different than what it ended being.
One thing I regret from this course is the content of the video lectures.
Very poor and a complete lack of interaction from Mentors/Tutors.
Dry videos.
Apart from the book the courses does not offer me anything.
No new learning during this course.
Instructor was good.
I have switched session, but for the second time nobody reviewed my assignment for the second time!
Poor video quality, weak, ad hoc examples, not well thought flow.
To help you understand what I expect, I'm taking this at the same time as I'm taking Wharton's Week 1 Entrepreneurship program.
I would not recommend it if you already have an interest or general knowledge of nu
Very few amount of exercise and very small gain of knowledge from Capstone.
It is not a bad course, but it is very little informative.
(Part 1 was similar, but it was possible to upload the document to Coursera directly and peer review was a required part of the course, resulting in a grade.)
Not many assignments instead of the last one.
I sent notes to coursera about this with no reply.
While the content is good you really have to work to get through the presentation of the material.
Coursera usually has more credible courses.
When we were assigned an elevator pitch as an assignment, it might have been nice to have seen some examples of elevator pitches--what makes a good (or a bad) elevator pitch?
That shows that this is a poorly put together course.
Perch's Law or law of (the) excluded middle.
There absolutely HAS to be a better teaching method than "reading the slides of bullet-ed text that I'm also showing".
Too preliminary!
Course teaches Python Pandas in a very practical way and I'm sure now having learnt it I'll use the skill.
There is no written material available, so if you can't follow the lectures, poor you.
Blows right through a lot of fundamental concepts without a deep enough explanation or enough practice material (especially in the last two weeks).
*sigh*
Not everyone is capable of testing, evaluating and giving constructive feedback.
I expected that something new would be introduced to give it a bit more value.
It wasn't even helping your memory.
I hope that the directions given to me by the course attendants will correct this problem, however.
For example, in the lecture of edit distance, the realization of the matrix was not well explained at all.
Despite this, users cannot use Graphlab for commercial purposes, therefore rendering the software completely impractical for professionals.
Too much material, that moved too fast.
These courses require a better math background and far more concrete explanation, since the student has a passive role and lecture mode is on.
Good idea / intend, horrible execution.
It's an extremely basic introduction... which doesn't help in much for the next session (R Programming)
Moreover, I work for a small non-profit, and we have neither the funds or bandwidth to utilize programs like this.
While overall it is not a bad course, I believe a lot of people come here expecting very different material.
Instructor mostly reads off the slides.
It might be more useful for those who look solely at long term data and make choices "at a distance" so to speak.
It offers nothing to prepare you to actually do any real life HTML coding.
I feel that the course does cover adequate topic to improve our mastery of data analysis in Excel.
I started the course with high hopes, and i was beginning to enjoy the subject matter.
I"m very disappointed.
It is very well designed for total beginner of programming.
Too much ppt and theory, while little examples and real code
This specialization starts with a bang and ends very boring and outdated feeling.
Professors accent very hard to understand.
The "interviews" that often serve as a second lecture for the week mostly repeat the first lecture /average duration for both - 5 minutes/Almost no reading materials in english.
The translations in English isn't very good.
The peer review processes for the final assignment is flawed, since you will be given to review works in spanish and english, with no option to"skip" to an essay in a language you understand.
This course is mostly theory based and certainly not what i am expected!
Most of the video's hardly offer insights - they last only 2 minutes and cover a few of those definitions.
NOT ONCE did a TA wake up and step in.
However, I lost a great deal of time viewing incomplete videos and trying to complete quizzes covering material that was not addressed or only partially addressed in the videos.
This course, though fun, was not intensive at all.
Basically, all I learned were from readings and textbooks.
I think this information is very dated - Calories In/Calories Out, High Carb/Low Fat, recommending exercise to lose weight, vegetable oils recommended/animal fats denigrated .
Dr. Clifford Saron's lectures were interesting.
I'm looking forward to the next course and hope the material is all ready to go!
I found the distractors to be too similar to the answer, what is the point in having 4 possible correct answers?
The material was was too much for the estimated time given to spend on the course per week.
This questions required answers to be typed in Pinyin or in Chinese characters.
it was ok but 5ara
After about week 6, helpfulness decreased quite a lot..
It was way too theoretical, the concepts were not clearly explained, the tests had concepts that had not been explained and the teacher is not good explaining it, it is too monotonous
Very basic course... probably won't teach you a lot of new things
Personally I don't recommend this course.
You ask "Why did I pay $50 to hack on my own?
Nor do I find it in keeping with the claim this should be fun.
So I most likely won't be able to finish this course.
Concepts are very hard to understand, even with some background knowledge in statistics.
I wish I new it in advance, I wouldn't have enrolled.
Sorry for my English.
So many people looking forward to take this course and was very cold, robotic... full of theoretical and repetitive texts.
Interesting topics, and some good information presented on a variety of issues for many animals and situations.
This course in particular was ok, but lectures and application (projects and assignments) had such a wide gap between them I found that I was mostly teaching myself...
Mostly common knowledge
I think there there is too much time given to the esoteric of what makes plots pretty rather than the nuts and bolts of how to do it and the limitations of using Pandas and Matplotlib for real world data
They make so many mistakes in the video lectures and they also laughts in the middle of the course and they send a non-professional feeling to the students.
The correct option here is only to match all the answers and the "all of the above" line.
The course only mentioned the draft SDGs, which changed considerably later on.
The subtitles/transcripts are a disappointment :( .
needs more clarity
I'd learned more since I check Harvard Health Blog so often.
However, the course gave no information on how to type the Pinyin tone marks or Chinese characters into the response boxes.
(In the comments on this, the instructor said there wasn't time in this course to explain Node modules, but that he provided a "clearer" example in the Node.
js course.
I don't think your 5mn max duration really makes sense.
For a beginner's course it is way too difficult and time consuming.
Super boring & clinical presentation of the material.
Very disappointed - I will now look elsewhere to satisfy my learning.
It certainly wasn't worth the price.
If it was free I would have no complaints, but since it is part of a specialization, I expect more.
So I am a little confused as to how we are expected to answer (truthfully?!)
this course is suitable for beginning
The second course (from idea to startup) is much better.
"Mastering...".. really?
I wish this course would actually show me how to solve PRACTICAL business problems.
The 2nd part of the course is not enjoyable at all.
The contents are so thin.
Therefore I spent quite some time on grading, which I did not expect
A specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents.
Otherwise, you might find it is just to show off how how complex and mysterious is the data science.
It was too introductory.
The course was very generic and didn't teach that much.
No offense, but the professor could have made it much more interaction by making the better slights he would just read values without even using markers
Pace of course is also extremely slow, though it may be appropriate for novice students.
It would be better to have multiple small demos in a module for different slides/topics instead of just monotonically reading out the slides and then having one demo at the end.
Too many lab issues.
The material was interesting, but it lacked in sufficient practice resources for the mathematical portions.
subject matter covered at a high level without much discussion!
This course is pretty old considering how fast this field changes,
...
Good content but man I am struggling with the verbose, pedantic style.
Building on top of each other project has its negative.
Dr Moerman is passionate about qualitative research and does use some interesting examples to illustrate his ideas, some of which are drawn from his own research experiences.
For free, the course may be still useful as early introduction to strategy but as paid course, refrain for the time being.
My earlier review below.-----Delivery of the course - presentation, videos, sequencing and articles for each video are very well organized and executed.
The course has a lot of points to cover with few explanation
I spent on average 2 hours for each assignment that suggested 10 mins to complete.
This course seems aimed at non legal students, considering the very rare references to the legal instruments' articles.
We should be learning about Android for 4 more hours rather than reviewing code for other people for 4 more hours.
The thing I found most frustrating is that the assignments are trying to force a particular coding style on everyone.
But was less interactive.
I enjoyed some of this course content, but mostly did not enjoy the course delivery.
I am not sure that there was anything new for me in this course.
I do like blues and listen it very often, but this doesn't help me.
I expected a more in-depth class with details and analysis about the global energy business.
Good: The video lectures cover a nice variety of topics giving you a good introduction of journalism, ethics, and other important considerations for becoming a journalist.
Bad: The entire course feels hastily put together.
I know he explained why the actual music was not included but think he could have done more to provide links and stimulate listening.
Lecture quality is not as good as other sessions of the course.
So I think this system must change, maybe the mentor should do it.
If you want to do all the specialization, ok, go and do this course.
Does the specialisation need such a long introduction?
The course was great, however I think it should be more video content.
This course is pretty basic.
Excessively short course.
After AlphaGo proved that a computer program is more skillful in a complex game of GO than one of the top human players - it will not take much to the next step - strategical decision making on a corporate level.
I would have preferred to have a single, consistently good instructor.
This is not a beginners course!
It was very distracting.
The students were just left to themselves to try and interpret what the instructor meant, and what was the proper thing to do in regards to the peer grading.
I finished this course only because I wanted to get through the specialization course.
Besides that, I don't like the tasks.
The lectures were nothing more than a person reading from the reference text.
You'll find videos on the web that can help you with the subjects covered and do a better job explaining the concepts.
It's completely impractical, the most of the time I spent reading the description of simulation model, but the coding itself was just playing with 2D coordinates and some basic recursion.
A little bit tedious/monotonous course.
There was some useful content in the class but the organization was poor and there was almost no evidence of course design or use of the teaching techniques I expected to see from a major university.
Not all subjects in the quizzes were covered in the study material provided or in the lessons
I'm not certain that it has the depth necessary for those that may have difficulty though.
Only one assignment at the end, so you go through 3 weeks before being asked to code (this seems like a big mistake for any programming course).
So, I switched to another course on a different platform to be able to make the best of my time.
So instead of short interactive videos, this has slides with lengthy essential spoken word with it; hardly summaries.
Quizes are nice puzzles that need some thinking and math knowledge.
This was much less about the development of games as it was an intro to Unity.
I didn't learn many data science concepts in this class
The lessons are sometimes completely disconected from the graded assignments.
I did not find it engaging.
very slow and boring.
The info is necessary, but it's sufficient as a single week of content for a larger course.
There have been some undesirable references to equations, in terms of equating modeling to economic growth and investment.
This was fun as a refresher course.
These are key benchmarks in screenwriting.
Including one sequence where each quiz extended the previous one but if you there was no way to learn from your errors, especially an error in the first quiz.
For the peer graded assignments, there was one answer field for multiple questions, rather than one per question.
Very essential topics, but the instructor's delivery of content is inconsistent, glosses over explanations at time, "umms and arrrs" a lot, talks extremely fast at times.
Also, I do not need to see a tiny, grainy video inset of the instructor during the lecture videos.
its more a linux introducction, not the expected from the title.
They also went over Git and Github.
This isn't a class; it's a workshop.
It covers the basics.
Fun American English intermissions, that's about it.
The automatic evaluation system (the system for grade the submissions), doest't provide useful feedback.
They occasionally give examples that are too small to see in the video.
I have simply lost a logic inside this.2nd: Very difficult to get an idea: lecturer doesn`t try to simplify the content, even opposite - I had a feeling, that he makes easy things complicated for a reason.
The contents of this course could be interesting, but they end up being terribly boring.
My mistake, not yours, thanks for the opportunity.
I have to watch other videos in youtube to get a better grasp of the concepts.
Good thing is that this is an introductory course, and the codes are given.
Also, there are misspellings in the quizzes.
This class jumped around and didn't give full explanations and had questions on one quiz that we didn't learn until the next week.
Not very like this course... especially those videos are introduced by female speaker....
we dont have this kind of software, can't understand and practice it....
Knowledge is not only formula.
While I love Dr. van Lent's teaching style, I was somewhat disappointed in the course as a whole.
It should clearly state that advanced statistics is a prerequisite knowledge.
The videos did cover the basic theories behind all the methods for portfolio management however they were just basic theories with no explanation on how to practically implement them and then asking us who only understand the theories from the videos to suddenly try to solve the calculation quizzes especially those excel calculations without any practice on how to implement them beforehand.
The material is very interesting.
With all of the extra time taken to put the course together, I expected to get a lot more out of it.
On the plus side, I admire how he shares the Greek language with us so capably and combines art with his lectures.
Too difficult.
The third week which I think was the most important one have too many information to learn and assimilate whereas the first two weeks could be rearranged to start multivariate regression earlier.
However, if you have a bit of background in healthy eating, you may not get as much out of this course.
implementing simplified form of Hadoop map-reduce or something like that so I can use it after the course.
What is the good sample for eating or cooking?
Even at 2x speed, I feel Iyengar should further practice is presentation and redo the videos.
The lecturer is terrible.
Besides this glitch however this course was great.
Programming is a practical skill.
I have been informed that the course is being reviewed by the instructors for strengthening and I 100% agree with that direction.
Real Life intervened in that and other ways.
Jumps around, doesn't put anything into "real world" examples.
it is good course
I found that the portion of the class that taught story-telling was painfully over simplified.
Details here: https://www.
coursera.
org/learn/swift-programming/discussions/DBk-SJO2EeWNbBIwwhtGwQ
Sorry but although I found the topic of interest I found the delivery very dull.
had to leave the course mid way.
There are better Excel DA courses out there.
I don't like that one professor uses this course to push his startup by asking students to use graphlab.
Those memories were too ancient in my case :-(
Job well done!
The instructor's lessons are poorly organized, his activities offer little value, and the quiz questions and answers are poorly written with regards to grammar and depth of knowledge.
This course left me with mixing feelings.
I must say that this was the WORST online course I've ever taken and I've taken a lot of online courses (including YouTube tutorials by people who were clearly intoxicated when creating their masterpieces).
To begin, the recommended software options for screen movies and presentation are awful choices - not to mention "Prezi" is subscription service.
Far too advanced for a total beginner as I am, was really hard and very confusing.
I don't think I have learned anything new.
I know I wasn't the only one struggling to keep up with the teacher after week 2.
Speakers sound so monotone and dry that they leave an unenthusiastic impression of an incredibly fascinating subject.
I wish the teachers would go more into how to come up with solutions to the functional problems.
However, that is not the main issue of this course, as I fully understand that the financial profit for the lecturer is very important.
However for FREE?
; )I did enjoy the rest of the course though.
Short and easy to handle presentations and topics.
One of the questions even referenced a book that was never mentioned or made available.
very high level syllabuses, limited application description of BD, poor quiz and questions designed
The professor just read the materials through all the modules, and the course was really boring.
Final project almost impossible to do with material taught.
ELEVEN MINUTES.
It is OK to be relaxed as long as the course delivers content in proportion to what has been paid !
There is also very little in the way of practical application.
Doesn't look quite helpful.
I sort of wanted more, but perhaps it's inappropriate for me to ask.
This should not be its own course, as it would be pretty useless if you were doing it on its own without doing any of the other courses.
This course was little more than a haphazard, ambling preview of a tiny bit of Swift.
Pretty average and way too short/fast paced videos.
Weak, definitely not what I would call a "course".
Very introductory.
Otherwise, stay away!
HTML and CSS were GREAT.
I'm quite disappointed.
I do not recommend this course.
One can dwell in PID controllers for life, its a huge are and the way its used here is totally ancient.
Quite a repetition of Fundamentals of Graphics Design, the first course in the specilization.
Blah.
An equivalent to reading manual on internet.
This class is more of a Marketing 101 class than a digital marketing class.
For people that are taking this specialization without a focus on game design and/or without ideas... this course is going to be hell to finish in time.
The lecturer for Week 3 and Week 4 should resign with immediate effect and find a job at a school for lower class students where she can continue to brag about her industry expertise without being so irritating.
Many concepts are juggled with without giving clear, mathematical definitions.
the formulas shown in the pdf slides are a mess, not a mathematical summary, etc), and the level of the quizzes is very basic.
And the last two weeks should have more content.
The VM doesn't work out of the box sometimes for the hands on activities
I think a better example could be used.
Does not teach Excel very well while tryng to apply the basic usage instruction to not too difficult problems.
A lot of the content they cover isn't even utilized in the assignments of the course.
The week 3 assignment instructions are actually incomplete.
This course lacks projects to implement the skills we learn.
the course really covered information I knew but made simple concepts complex - that is just my opinion
While there is some interesting content, particuarly in the last week on design thinking, some of the course topics don't seem to hold together well, and the videos include a lot of monotonous talking heads.
There is so much detail and explanation about the statistics and concepts behind how it works, but there is hardly ever an actual lesson on the code used or needed to implement the algorithms.
Brian Caffo's lectures in Statistical Inference were good; in this course they seem to veer left and right rather than get straight to the essence of whatever subject he is lecturing about.
A more structured final project would have been helpful.
The course instruction is at 10000 feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will NOT teach you the skills required to complete the assignments.
I recommend the Machine Learning Course (from Bill's colleagues) at University of Washington.
A very lightweight intro to HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and a dash of Boostrap.
Furthermore, the assignments weren't graded on a timely basis, which left very room to collaborate and refine.
As a buddhist, I feel upset of this course.
It would better to separate consumer behaviour and market research, as different courses.
Also, too many type-in answers for quizzes.
The "in class" examples appeared to be completely hypothetical and were also read to the viewer without any video demonstration of how the presented information works in an actual class.
In addition, the written information in the videos was confusingly organized and had not been fully edited.
This course was not overly interesting, it felt more like listening to someone wanting to paint everything with a socialist brush.
Telling me to wait a year, get outside help and try again is not in any manner fun or helpful.
they will stuck somewhere and only audio will be continuing .
I have a doubt about such approach and this particular course as one before a capstone project (to my opinion it should be held after a capstone)
Most of the "gamified" practices outside coursera were good though.
Hinton is certainly a guru in Machine Learning, but I found him a bit boring as a teacher and often I thought he was explaining some details but failing to give the broader picture.
+ it is not free.
i liked most the additional material.
The second course is much better, nevertheless.
Initially I thought this was a great course, but my optimism quickly dissipated.
He has a clear outline, but his definitions are not clear and are very vague.
the lessons were too long in duration and i was really bored because the teaching didn't have anything engaging me to be more eager to listen and all the slides were with the same background and design and there were no pictures or animation or fun stuff to create some kind of diversity in the progress of the course.
THIS course is only good if you have basic knowledge regarding ,materials science and this course is highly based on research papers and research domain .
The instructor speaks too slowly and it takes her a long time to explain simple ideas.
Trash bins as a reference of a new strategical approach - misses a point that it is not a mass product.
And they are also active in answering questions.
Would have preferred more flesh (both implementational and mathematical) on the bones.
Very poor content.
It has a lot of problems, including: Not so many lectures about excel itself - most of the time you will be watching videos about statistic methods.
And these contents are not connect to the teaching materials closely.
Personally, when I take a course, I take a look at the assignment and then see what knowledge I need to have in order to complete the assignment.
There is hardly any input from instructor about genuine theoretical questions.
All the contents covered in these course videos can be summarized in a 10-minute video.
It seems that they were automatically generated from the videos, thus suffering with the poor pronunciation.
The teachers use mathematical sophistication that feels unnecessary, but to be fair, they do mention it on the FAQ as part of the necessary background.
He's sing-songy, trying to be interesting.
In the conclusion, Iyengar states that no textbooks are available for the field because it is "new", but an Amazon search shows several seem to exist, and many of the studies referenced in this course are years old, even more than a decade in some cases... so I think better materials for more organized slides must exist.
Indeed, they have a point: it was the first (and, admirably, the shortest) modern written constitution.
I could have easily done with slides than a lecture.
It is as if I dropped into a void.
I paid a decent amount of money to attend this course and very disappointed that it is simply run on auto pilot with no place to go for resolution, questions or help.
I would NOT recommend taking this course and would better advise you to find something in another online teaching program or course within Coursera that has at least a modicum of personal interaction.
A few things that can be improved:1- The video material was very short.
I am also dismayed by the lack of community participation in the forums.
I have to retake almost every quiz under her courses.
I spent 75% of my time to get the examples to work.
Topics were not taken in depth and enough clarity.
A few videos were not edited properly resulting in lengthy black screens after the presenters were done talking.
Not lot of hands on
Time is spent on focusing on the things to learn, and you get a lot out of it.
I am dropping out of this specialization and will follow the other one which I hope will bring good content (unfortunately the following classes are not from the same teacher but from the same university).
The class needs to be more accessible especially for non statisticians, I learned more from khan academy which got me through this class than the class itself
The explanation of roles is clear.
Just recently, Dato (the company that owns graphlab) was purchased by Apple, and you can no longer buy a commercial licence to the software.
In my case, I ran into several errors which I couldn't get help in solving by using the course Forum, as the end of course deadline was just a few days ahead.
I didn't buy into the class so I could watch ads!
Just some thoughts.
The power behind online learning is that if it takes you three views to understand it all, you have the luxury.
Considering the large variety of audience, I would recommend the instructors separate the comprehensive more in-depth knowledge into optional videos, in this way the audiences could decide if they want to spend time in optional videos or not based on their own needs, meanwhile the instructors could spend a little bit more time to explain the difficult concepts better.
Clustering topic is covered superficially, too much time spend on employing ggplot graphs, not very useful since making graphs is straightforward on other software, like excel, once you aggregate datasets correctly.
This course seems 'light' in content - too much time is spent reviewing case studies instead of discussing different ways to create documents that enable reproducible research.
It shows you some great functions in Octave, but I'm confused about all the Θ₁ and Θ₂ stuff.
While it is evident that each of the Roosevelts had a significant impact on their respective time in history, saying that it was a Rooseveltian century is going a bit too far.
The assignments are highly dissociated from the course material.
Interesting subject, but not much content and assessments are way too short.
The Professor's explanation is monotonic and he uses textual definitions rather than simple explanations
It was difficult to me!
I had a non-English-speaking person NOT pass me, a former English teacher, for no other reason than he misread the assignment.
Maybe the reason is in all points I have just mentioned, but I didn`t enjoy this course at all and it was the first time I didn`t enjoy something connected with web app development.
The exercises are not very interesting.
Basically, too much theory and too little practice.
In my opinion this course does not fit to the specialization well.
Seems like it was for experienced musicians, eve though the goals of the course hinted at it being for beginners as well.
I would suggest additional videos explaining the implementation in matlab would be helpful and would throw more insight to the maths.
Very interesting subject.
If I were at UW, this is not the kind of course I'd want representing my university in a public setting.
which is not every one's interest field .
Disappointed.
So it just leaves the "graduate" overwhelmed and kind of spinning in a circle.
This required a lot of work with little gained.
I have gained some theoretical knowledge about problem solving and decision making techniques, but we weren't given enough practical examples on how we should apply these techniques at work.
Now I'm in them mist of it Paid for blue host.
Best wishes
Some of the assignments seemed overly complicated and irrelevant to the topics discussed.
Aimed at those needing to get services -- in a spectrum of family living.
Please let someone who can speak English fluently teach the course, please.
I found the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning course gave a much better intuition and understanding of this subject.
I didn't learn anything useful!I just didn't like this course at all.
There is absolutely no supervision on this course.
Definitely not for a beginner.
Wish there were more visuals, and assignments to do alongside the professor.
I have a full time job and a family, I am not some young undergraduate with copious amounts of time to waste.
Some significant overlaps in content on the videos.
In Order to support this, assignments didnt had clear objective.
It all was too high level and never really got down enough to earth.
2 stars because the theoretical part is ok but programming assignments are waste of time.
However, the tools that come with the paid version are not easy to use or well explained for the lay person.
There are some website errors.
It would have been more useful if the full course is taught by the 2 of them that can actually speak good.
material should be refreshed some already outdated
If he shared his passion for the subject with us it would be more enjoyable.
I need more practical example related to mentioned theories and concepts in lectures
Hello.
I was actually very excited for this course, yet it disappointed me.
One more point is that, the contents of videos are not that enough.
Kind of hard to follow.
As a guy who takes and make his own notes, I found it really difficult to put together a sentence he was saying.
Mess with table and field names.
Very basic information.
And I am 30 years, not16.
Assuming that they will make major improvements for the next round and noting that Coursera's infrastructure is excellent, don't be scared to take the class.
I do not know who generates the quiz questions but they seemed to require a lot of mental gymnastics for a multiple choice quiz.
Too difficult to follow by people new in the programming area.
Often, the input format/arguments are designed to take redundant info.
That should be made clear up-front in the course description.
That's information that you look up when you need it, not that you quiz people on.
If you just want to LEARN about UX and human centered design, then it's a 4-5 star course.
His presentation in English is honestly quite hard to understand.
If this is what you are looking for it may be worth your time, just be aware that the "production" (quality) of the videos is among the worst courses I have taken in Coursera.
The most important benefit of this course is the fact that it exists.
This course could be ~1/2 as long, cover the same material, and be a MUCH better course.
Other small problems include some poorly edit videos (there are a lot of examples of simple stumbling in the videos that should have meant they do another take), very short videos (maybe a person preference, but the number of <2 minute videos here is annoying, especially when there's a 5-second standard video at the start and end of all videos).
The reason I'm taking this class is because I have a hard time motivating myself to learn on my own, so I need something that will really push me.
regarding the service industry as stated at the beginning of the course.
I felt like the test-candidate for a new course.
From my past experience, I know it’s not easy for people to take suggestions.
Cyber security is hardly covered in course.
The Spark courses from edX are way better than these.
The case study approach is a great idea.
But I wish the instructors were more candid about the tools that were in use.
Nice idea, but too many technical difficulties.
I was hoping this course could easily be done in the evening hours.
If Coursera would change the title to "Responsive Web Design" instead of "Information Design" I'd give the course 4 stars.
This course was too messy.
Very basic and not especially much fun or challenging
But, if this is not your objective, do not waste your time.
This and Intro to financial accounting.
Additionally, the assignments are not functioning properly and it creates much confusion.
(And my family is Dutch with all the offensive humor that comes with it, so it's not just a matter of the sense of humor not translating)I'm re-taking Statistics with Calculus online at my local state university and frankly, I can't notice any benefit from taking this course first.
to much talk
I wasted half a day on this.
Compared to other classes that I have taken on Coursera, it has rather low production values.
I didn't get much out of it
The class was a helpful intro to pandas.
The first week was ok , but we didn't spend much time coding.
I learned a lot in HTML and CSS under this proff but not a lot from this course.
The content is important and the course goes through a great extension of the NLP topics but the methodology is bad.
As others note, there is zero reading material.
I do not feel that this course is ready for publication and is overlong for the material presented.
R is a good to know tool, but so many of these process are automated now.
A topic such as missing data is naturally very complex and I wouldn't expect a short course on Coursera to be able to adequately cover it.
More interactive assignments using the parser would have been great.
The lectures get you through the basics in a clear, understandable way.
But the auto-grader was really a bad idea, that got the lecturer into a lot of trouble for very little gain if any.
It seems to me that peer-reviewed assessments, with proper instructions, are better suited.
It is just not working for me.
Why not label it as an intermediate or higher class?
I know I could have contacted them if I had a question, but I didn't because it was so easy.
This course offered a lot of great information (even if it was a weird combo of factual/opinionated) I was frustrated by the fact that this course is OBVIOUSLY geared towards the upper middle class/rich instead of the the everyday blue-collar family.
If you read the course contents - you already get 75% of what is presented in the videos.
Besides, the fixes that would need to be made on the instructor's side are minor, but when working without those fixes, things get infuriatingly frustrating rather quickly.
There are errors in the code supplied by the instructor that need to be pointed out by students, scripts sometimes don't work, explanations are sub-par when explaining things such as $scope.
Also, several of the musical sections seemed to be in the wrong place.
I hope you will find a way that works.
This course is not at all beginner friendly, really hard to follow the assignments and the lectures if you do not have a programming or R background.
I haven't been able to answer a classmate's request to review his work & worse, I haven't been able to print off my own work for reference & this is a REAL project so I need to be able to do this.
You can just read the required textbook to get all knowledge and examples.
In particular you can see that it is a bad course, if you compare it to the previous 2 courses in the specialization.
The course only contained a single project, which although fun, is not enough for learning a new language.
All in all, it is a price worth paying for the amazing knowledge you gain.
I found Week 2: Binary Classification really confusing.
I have been waiting for over 3 months for the 1st assignment to get regraded.
In the future I suggest the creators of this course stay away from peer graded assignment as it puts students in a position where their grade depends on others and not the knowledge the student acquires from the course content.
Considering this is a technology course, you would think this would be addressed.
The concepts are good but the delivery is quite dry.
Some of the activities were repetitious but I guess the craft of writing is but there was a sense of the course tapering away at the end with a proposal letter to a publisher with very little exemplar material being provided to assist.
Not the greatest Python course in the world.
There are a number of very broad stroke videos on Rails, as well as several brief videos covering a number of third party libraries or tools sometimes required to build Rail apps.
I was very disappointed in this course which held much promise.
i wish there also had been a section on how to recognise different illnesses in chickens and demonstration on how to humanely kill a chicken for example.
I enjoyed the course for what it was but i wish it had been taught with far more depth and breadth
Was a little too basic.
Extremely dry, academic style presentation, could use a LOT of work to make it appeal to others in the future.
The material could likely have been covered more quickly and allowed for more time to be spent on more tangible, every day information that might help those that are not already teachers.
Lectures are totally useless for the assignment,The course is really good until week 4 when it deteriorates very quick.
The videos and documents are not balanced with the quizzes.
The videos and lectures were fine, but there seemed to be a lot missing from this course.
Pretty let down and $79 waste
On the other hand he goes into unnecessary detail and then quizzes you on it even though its not relevant to the course (typical bricks and mortar education type BS).
It was very hard for me to learn I am not good at javascript
If you're sincerely interested in learning IXD and creating a high quality portfolio piece, this course is moderately helpful toward that end, but you'll need to supplement it with lots of outside reading and in person coursework to really get where you want to be.
doesn't tell you from the start that you have to pay for it.
Not very useful.
Most of the time the instructors are reading off a script, and everything feels fake.
I believe having a set of cases that get reused in some form over all lectures would be very beneficial for -at lease mine- understanding the topics.
I found listening to the instructor just read notes became very tedious very quickly.
Just a lot of talk and nothing practical.
Positive: Readings and references allow for an additional study of related course concepts.
Negative: Course is excessively short - both in number of modules and also in resources per module.
While this course might be suitable for somebody new to this topic, it was not very useful for me.
Not new to MOOC courses.
Dr. Singer is a fascinating person to learn from and I am glad I took the time to pursue the course.
He speaks much more for an audience of grad students.
a) There clearly was a huge amount of criminal behavior that contributed to the crisis.
No access to quizzes or evaluations as auditing participant, which is a shame since most of the Coursera MOOCs allow access to evaluation material under the auditing modality.
Thank you for you time and for everything you did.
As an introduction, I did not find that there's need to talk about the hosting and the other things related to this topic.
However, even though it’s an online course, they barely use any teaching method besides very raw slides, some dry mathematical proofs and someone speaking about the content.
Your courses have very reasonable quality, but fails completely in quantity.
It is a course with great content and a lot of potential, but the way how it is delivered can be greatly improved to make it easier to understand and more engaging.
The delivery adds nothing to the content, especially as much of it is simply the presenters reading lists also shown on screen.
One of the most important aspects of multitasking that was not covered and that is really needed is how to multitask in a situation of "housewife" type of work.
And why are there super-specific questions on quizzes about things like what specific funders require in a grant proposal?
Definitely could be more systematic and clear.
This is a complex subject and the prof is trying his best, but there are times the explanation is not sufficient.
It is like learning calculus from the math instructor that thinks some of the steps are so obvious that he can skip them forgetting he has a PhD in math.
This would have taken seconds to check had the person who wrote it bothered to check their work beforehand.
Thing is, the tasks provided in principle weren't that hard, they were actually kind of too easy.
faculty read the script and struggled with pronunciation, fluency and generally engaging presentation.
Some of the material, like the lengthy historical review of Edinburgh's vet school, might be good advertising and interesting, but does not fall under the scope of 'what it takes to be a vet'.
Didnt find it very interesting because of language interpretation issues.
I was expecting more tricks how to apply this in practice.
The course content was not very appealing.
Sometimes the code examples in the slides contain mistakes.
The volume isn't consistent, even within videos.
to tackle the problem is to read someone's third party monologue about how to make your reviewers happy.
Slow, never to the point, repetitive, presentation and communication outdated.
The video materials were very poor, they did not cover all the aspects and the explanations were very brief.
"We will not provide 101 teachings/readings."
Instructions were very unclear compared to the rest of the courses in the specialization.
Like other Coursera course i found it boring whatever text on slide i learnt but nothing interactive and practical.
Disappointing
I had a lot of experience in classical music but I was puzzled with what goes on in this course.
This course is a first time programming class using Python.
Throughout the course, with only a few exceptions, I lacked the feeling I was learning something.
Some matters were just given formulas and there was a lack of practice.
Examples given were not well thought-out, for example HR was said to be hard-set because it was "outsourced" which doesn't make sense.
I would not, incidentally, rate the course at an intermediate level.
My advice is if you are a novice, take the free course first to see if you can complete it.
Then return to him; maybe.
It is a nice introduction, but the material is barely worth a one week orientation lesson (I have completed it in about 4 hours with watching all the videos, taking detailed notes, and completing the quizzes for 100%) .
Not the quality i expected.
The lectures were short to start with, but adding more examples and passages would have helped.2) Xylophone is perhaps the worst instrument to use to teach this course, especially with the camera facing the front of the xylophone.
The email reminders from Coursera about assignments, etc... kept me on track and kept me in the class.
The mutation confers a fighting advantage, perhaps, but it has no will of its own.
(2) Classifier block diagram shown by Professor Guestrin is good, clearly distinguishing training the classifier and the subsequent use of the classification (prediction).
Where are they from?
I tried pinpointing exactly what the problem was and I came up with following:There is too much talking and not enough going on visually.
But there are a bunch of quizzes, which are sometimes quite off the lecture material and you have to research a lot to get all of the questions right.
Course moved a little too slowly
Don´t pay or this course, find some other course free or other paid course with better reviews.
The videos I liked were mostly the office hours ones and the one with the interview with Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove at Park Avenue Synagogue.
instead of going with basics they teach you to manipulate images .
The content is really great....
However, you can buy the book for $15 and get almost all of the same information — in sum, the class is essentially chapters from the book, the movie and a bunch of links to websites with relevant content.
The course seems to be a course in Scrummerfall, i.
e., a mixture of Scrum and Waterfall.
All talking, don't even have slides to assist with the presentation of materials, also seemed to have focused too much on the European Union/Convention instead of the Common Law itself.
It is too basic content, I can't imagine an specialization with material that basic.
Paid for my web name and it looks like I'm going to have to pay someone to finish it.
The content of this course is interesting, I liked the examples, and the material gave an interesting overview of different aspects of machine learning.
But in an online class, I didn't feel that kinship at all.
I'll make a disclaimer that much of this review is about how I personally felt about the course, and about how it wasn't right for me.
Really very basic, anyone with an interest in the subject is likely to know most of this already.
Not meant for a complete beginner.
Out of the four courses of the specialization, Managing Talent is the weakest
However I learnt useful tips!
the language was pretty turgid.-he could have just provided a PDF of his paper / notes for us to download.
It should be noted that Pro Tools First (the "FREE" version I downloaded) is a DETRIMENT to learning in this course and will effect your grade negatively.
And did I mention the lecturer doesn't even look directly at the viewer?
But, thanks for the teacher all the same.
It became very difficult understanding what the instructors said, either because the placement of the mic was not very good or the instructors were not speaking very clearly
Anyone who pays for this should get their money back.
it is good thing to learn
I ended up just reading the notes as videos were slow and took too much time.
I would have liked more detail, but I recognize this was intended to be a high level view so I'll live with that level of detail.
The Capstone itself (Option 1) is very interesting, but there is no really graduated evaluation.
It's really frustrating.
what is the difference between "number of distinct countries mentioned" and "number of countries mentioned in tweets".
The course need more improvement in the case of videos and always updates
It was a good course.
I like the case-based approach--this course gives a nice albeit shallow overview.
It is really not for beginners.
The videos were good.
Good info but kind of dry
Instructors have rushed to present course material .
I found most of the information irrelevant that added little value.
You can acquire a broad set of skills interfacing with the Raspberry PI but Google is your best friend.
I'd say this is more of a refresher course for intermediate/advanced users who are out of practice.
His students should leave the class more informed than when they came.
Unless you're lucky and receive a response from a mentor or someone with visible background in script writing, the reviews don't amount to much, because very few enrollees seem to know what is going on enough to provide a meaty assessment.
Maybe start with some eye-tracking on someone completing the course?
Hubiera sido genial que se puedan dar los exámenes, y ya el pago por el certificado aparte.
Very monotonous atmosphere.
I'm several months into this specialization.
When you do this in addition to working, it becomes a chore;- the assignments: instructions are tedious & confusing.
After spending so much time and efforts it should provide a certificate .
In that case, I began wondering why I was taking this course, rather than just reviewing the many free html5 explanations on the Internet.
Further the very general response to the submitted page of html gives me no help when I am simply told something isn't right and I should review the lessons--again.
Too simplistic if you already have some knowledge about a healthy lifestyle
The professors don't even disclose that there are two opposing historical schools: "New Historians," whom Palestinians reference; and traditional historians, favored by most Israelis.
For whatever reason, error messages kept coming up as I was trying to complete the assignments.
Not a good title for a class.
For example the lecturer's speech interrupts, changing words and thought-flow.
He lacks enthusiasm.
My recommendation: if you are interested in the topic, take this course and make your own mind up.
On week?
An example would have helped and the rubrics/criteria for grading should have been shown beforehand so students would be guided what points they would consider when making their piece.
A bit basic
Despite the pertinent content, the way the instructor gave the classes could have been way more intuitive.
And, in one area, instructor had to go back and fix something but didn't bother to provide guidance as to were to go and do this yourself.
It's often more difficult to maximize value to customers when personal incentives may not be perfectly aligned with customer (student) objectives.
As online students typically are neither, I'm surprised the course content wasn't better managed.
Very good lectures and examples.
I mean, it's replicated in the next classes, and it has silly questions in the practice quizzes.
Way too basic.
Video is of poor quality, instructor distracts you picking up his glasses from his nose every 5 seconds, reading outdated (you can suggests books from 2000 on Digital topics) and last assignment is based on a website that is not longer online.
The material is quite short: only 30 minutes of videos every week and no interviews with "real-life" managers.
The additional articles to read most relate to blue-chip companies that succeeded: Samsung, Toyota, Netflix, Google, and of course the obligatory Apple mentioned in every Strategy course on the planet.
The paste of the lectures is too slow.
I would like to say this course sucks compared with my sql course no matter how it is structured or how the instructor conducted the course.
When introduced to a new data set, what are some approaches to understanding that data?
Really disappointed with this course to the point I'm quiting -in spite of having paid for the grade-.
I would not pay for the course until I had passed peer review as odds are you never will.
I was really wainting for a course like that but, with all due respect and aknowledgement to the instructors, their is many ways this course could have been an inspiring and exciting journey.
The final project was especially difficult as not much was explained - I had to read the forums to figure out what I was actually supposed to do.
Useful only to new professionals, I learned nothing new
Suggest divide Week 6 into two sessions: Neural Network and Nearest Neighbor applying neural network results (ImageNet 2012 was mentioned and not explained.
I'd prefer if the videos were the source of knowledge instead of stack overflow and the forum.2 - As an experienced programmer but being new to Python I found it difficult to load the data.
ANOVA is used without any explanation of what it is.
I found myself searching online for other sources to understand the concepts.
The student needed to have a good foundation of statistics and high levels of math to be able to follow the class.
Provides a very summary overview of a very important aspect of data analysis.
I had to take Statistical Inference from Duke university to pass this course.
Too much work in a week.
I would have rather had links to supplemental readings that the materials were based on.
What does that even mean in an online course.
Very disappointed in this course.
I am not very happy about this course, I think it could be better if subjects would be deeper.
Most of them consisted of authors chatting with each other.
In this course each module had about 20 to 30 minutes of videos per module.
Interesting concept.
However, in my opinion, there is sometimes a lack of :- practice especially for the coding part (entire courses are exclusively theoretical)- explanations (during the courses, I have heard several times this sentence : "don't ask me why", which is disappointing in my learner experience and frustrating not to get the answers I was expecting.
without commentary beside.
I've paused repeatedly because I find the whole experience needlessly clunky and frustrating, and I rarely feel like I've learned much at the end of the assignments.
Interesting material, but its presentation is haphazard and incomprehensible.
Don't have the certificate to certify that I've undergone the course.
I bought the entire series of classes, but need to retake this one after I read some more from other sources and have had a chance to digest what's here.
The number of videos could be a lot more.
The entire 4 weeks could have (and should have) been condensed into 1 week.
In at least one video, the instructors had not fully deleted the sentences from a previous version of a slide.
What a waste of time .
I felt like this course was too repetitive.
The body is also better able to synthesize glucose (or utilize ketones instead of glucose to fuel cell function) than to synthesize amino acids, which are more easily obtained in the correct amounts from animal sources.
It either passes, or you get minimal feedback.
The answer is a mix, without identification.
So I wish we focused more on developing high fidelity work - in addition to the need-finding, user research, sketches, short weekly assignments.
There are steps that are missing at times which require you to scour for help.
There is a large difference between the skills acquired in the video's and the skills needed to fulfill the assignments.
While the instructors may be well versed in their fields, I felt the course took too long to get to the meat of the issue.
))The teacher often makes me confused as to where he got the numbers he is plugging in the formula or what answer the formula gives.
But I take it as a challenge and I intend to finish the course despite all of that.
I found much of the content to be interesting and timely.
Angular JS is a crucial component of all of the internet.
Some problem statements are ambiguous and not very clear unless you read more than one time or take a closer look at the examples.
I can't understand why this guy is trying to teach me if he doesn't know how to code?
However, I do think that a lot more could be done to improve the value of this course even if that means changing the scope of the materials.
Quizzes you were left with the task of answering questions based on models never seen or explained spent most time trying to make sense of them.
Received nothing!
I found the case studies (where you had to imagine a real life situation and select a decision) useful - there was one of these per week when I think there could have been more, perhaps three a week.
And it's free so take it and check out the others in the series.
His extrapolations as flawed as those of the EIA.
Teaching is more than just saying the facts, you have to explain things, lead the understanding.
I wanted to like this course, but (and perhaps it's a mathematician thing) the teacher just kept doing stuff without explaining WHY he is doing the stuff.
By week 5 you are just plain bored.
The transcripts are no better and also contain many mistakes.
The grader functionality is bullshit.
I found difficult to navigate within the course and the style of the course is not very modern.
The professor is reading long texts.
The final project did not require use of the material in the course beyond the first week and a half.
That said I have serious concerns about the quality of execution for Part II of the course, which was much inferior to part I of the course.
In general, the lectures themselves were up to the quality of part I and are well done.
Some of the features covered in this course I researched on my own to create the final development project in Course 3.
I'm not sure if the material presented in this course warranted a whole separate course (even if it only was one week).
This course gave me basics, but the learning was very stiff.
Effort were mostly wasted as little learning has been retained.
Also the materials are very pro-american culture like this link http://mentalfloss.
com/article/65218/10-myers-briggs-type-charts-pop-culture-characters Not very helpful and inclusive.
I believe I could have completed this course without ever taking the first two classes because the assignments only required slight modifications to existing code.
I had hoped to get more information about how America is seen by the (foreign) masses.
There are not too many help from the mentors and the peer assigment in week 4 took me too much time and had to consult a lot of external resources.
The reading materials were much more so.
Ok course.
When I am taking a course from Wharton school, and from adult learning perspective, more is expected than simply small lectures and few activities.
Best to take this course after trying Swirl, Data Camp, or Code School.
I think this was a poorly structured online course.
OK. the main professor clearly knows his stuff.
Too Fast.
Too short, too simple, too theoretic.
I found of little interest the slides, partially interesting the swirl exercise, interesting the programming assignment.
I would like to have a longer course with more practical examples.
Too qualitative, too much theory, narrative.
Needs more specific examples of how numbers are manipulated for e.
g.
Short videos, and few of them.
He does not define these terms, nor allude to them ever again.
The lessons, as they are currently presented, encourage rote memorization and rob the students of actually applying the concepts/code taught.
Also, I love the idea of this specialization.
Content is good though.
Some of the knowledge is useful in life.
in some assignment a required step was only explained in the following week (Centering variables).
Assignments review depend only on peer review, when peers in most of the time don't read through assignment completely or open attachments leading to poor grading based on 'missed information' that are actually attached in submissions.
Also this course along with the rest of the courses in the Data Analysis and Interpretation need some more focus on using SAS and other data analysis tools and the way to present results in a more appealing way.
I am not connecting to the instructor at all.
It is a good contextual introduction if you never heard of "search engine marketing", "cost per acquisition" or "click through rate".
Princeton and Stanford offer much higher quality and presentation on the same topics.
The problem of this class is mostly one assignment: The statement of problem set 3 is very unclear while the feedback from the grader is too little to improve anything.
Good course, but NO Statement of Accomplishment certificate
This course needs major improvement.
Assignments are not well prepared: forms are not helping either people accomplishing the assignment, or the people reviewing their work.
We have to go back and forth to review the question answered in both cases (when filling-out or reviewing), and sometimes notation criteria are not clear upfront.
Please review the assignments and improve them, because it was really frustrating.
Information presented was too basic.
It lacks steps of what actually needs to be done to achieve SEO.
It focuses on easily teachable and repeatable lessons that teach a certain, standard way of doing things.
They are only useful from people who have no background in finance.
This course lacks a level of professionalism.
First of all, thank you for the course, as it enables students to get a bit more up-to-date and knowledgeable in the topic.
On the other hand, unfortunately it's not worth one's time as it didn't deliver very good quality, nor on its promise regarding "The Big Picture".
Pros:Easy to understand.
Self-paced.
Objectivity and positive overall message.
Cons:Overall quality and clarity of the lectures is not very good.
However there were a few requirements for the graded portion of the assignment that they don't even tell you about (expected return values under certain situations) until you actually run the grader.
He said the swirl is an optional part but he does not realized what he shows is much worse than swirl.
For my taste most of the information is far too specific and tied to one scenario.
They won't teach you make well formed HTML documents, complete CSS files or learn to program in JavaScript.
The presenter in this course is hard to follow and does not have good slides.
No practical examples.
This course can give you hands on advice on how to manage a sprint that solve a design issue.
You're on your own to learn the material and you won't get timely responses (if any) from the staff.
The students' answer on the blog are not answered from Coursera staff
Hello, I learned some new knowledge about entrepreneurship, and this course was helpful for me.
And I have done the "talking to the camera" thing and it can be deadly for presenters.
I would not recommend this course for anything beyond casual reading.
Also found the content slightly ambiguous, you might have to do some trial and error and might be surprised at the answers in the quiz.
It was very confusing and the questions were cryptic
Some of the videos have summarizing points, which is helpful when taking notes, but they flash on the screen briefly, then cut to a closeup of the lecturer, then cut back to the summery points so quickly that you can't copy them down and it becomes super distracting.
The quizzes are a joke.
Would be much better if more real-life examples and scenarios were used in the lectures to convey those abstract ideas.
Interesting course.
The course offers just a simple running of (interesting and useful) code, but doesn't put the student in the situation of thinking and creating ideas and code.
This is definitely not the way to learn Python for Data Science if you are a busy professional software engineer.
The review in the next course covered most of the same things.
I had no problem giving the quizzes with the lectures.
It took 3 hours for each segment of the first week... not 3 to 4 as was stated.
They are very short and therefore I do not need an introduction/closeout for each individual one.
Additional knowledge gained was very little.
For example, Must Use the Four Forces Model when evaluating Strategy.
Lectures are very monotonous-sounding.
I was hoping to come away from this course with a richer understanding of Ancient Egypt.
Felt somewhat light on substance.
This in turn made it difficult for me personally to actually connect the weekly information presented with the overall meaning and the objective of each module.
A bit difficult to understand the language for non native speaker.
Weeks 1 &2 were worthwhile.
I I already have a decent foundation in coding and took the course with the idea I could get a refresher on Java.
Very little new and does not include more complex sensitivity analysis for corporate valuation
Android studio feels more like a toy than a complete product.
As a supporter of equal opportunity, Duke University should take disciplinary action against Professor Rodger.
However, without the certificate it feels like all my efforts have gone in vain.
The lectures waste a good share of time as in places they barely scratch the surface of what is further required to be implemented in the assignments.
I can hardly say I feel I have learned any valuable stuff, especially in contrast to the first course when I had a feeling "I am growing with knowledge".
Here, I was able to follow lectures' instructions but I did not fully understand why I was doing this and that.
As these courses are supposed to be for interest why do you need 80% to pass?
Not as I expected.
When it came to JavaScript I couldn't follow, so much information was missing and lessons were not clear anymore.
Stylistically, pedagogically and content-wise - that's a much, much better Data Science class.
That approach really helped scaffold my learning.
I hope you'd consider revisiting this course's learning plan - or probably just state on the course info page that this course is more suitable for a refresher course rather than an introductory one.
These themes felt very surface-level and redundant.
I am a bit frustrated, as the course is built around this amazing tool: IBM Bluemix, that gave us high hopes of extracting super useful information, but it is impossible to use.
Incredibly frustrated by the peer grading system.
ANOVA and ANCOVA are mentioned in the description but they aren't explained anywhere.
and not so purely academic.
The programming exercises should not be optional.
I just realized that you have to upgrade(pay $49) in order to submit the quiz and receive the feedback.
There is no questions that the instructor of this course is an accomplished mathematician, I just found it hard to follow his lectures as he got deeper into various statistical aspects of the course.
I know you have a person in front of a white screen, and a few visual effects such as floating words and diagrams.
It's not really a 4 week course.
(3) Neural network quiz in Week 6 is excellent.
Would you have learned about solving equations?
This course tried to cover too many things like theory, practice, research, experience and so on.
Both the presentation itself and the in-video quizzes are unbelievably obnoxious.
So if you do not want a certicficate, I recommend this.
I learned nothing and felt no challenge whatsoever, in fact, I felt as though I was rehashing information from a 9th grade English class (no hyperbole).
Sorry, I am not satisfied.
This way you can see what notes are being hit, held, and you can see them from a pianist's view.
The material was good, but because of the two areas above the teaching was not as effective.
To fully grasp the theories underlyind in the lectures, slides would be determinant.
All assignments build upon the code written in the exercises in all previous weeks, so there is no way to know if you are starting off with correct code.
Maybe the hardest is that there are few exercises during classes to test the given information, so the grading tests become really hard to pass.
Whole specialization is actually one full course split into 4 tiny parts.
The course could be 1-week long instead of 4.
This was made even worse by the fact that some simulations took a long time to run which made iterating guesses very slow - and doing this on a time limit is just pointlessly stressful.
One of the assignments had the solution already in the source code as the instructors had forgotten to take it out.
The final assignment wouldn't even run out of the box without fixing bugs in the provided code.
(2) Course is better in the front end than in the back end.
Please improve this Specialization to encompass more depth in the course material or lower the price.
Other than swirl, it would be very helpful if there were basic optional exercises for those who have never programmed before.
The words are put so slow that it puts me off too sleep at times.
Having only video lessons is really heavy and time consuming.
JavaScript has a bad reputation, and sloppy teaching with respect to best practices is very bad.
There are very long locally-hosted readings (so they're hard to print and you can't add them to an offline reader app), and the Reading section for each lesson seems to be a bibliography (rather than actual reading assignments), because there are no links and some refer to "Selections" without giving page numbers or, in at least one case, a multi-volume book.
The assignments were alright.
On a few occasions, I had to back-track through the videos to find something I missed.
Teaching concepts that are not valid anymore.
Very very difficult.
However, I am missing the occasional bird's eye view, like how did we come to these conclusions and where do other team leads (maybe from different cultures) vary from these rules.
The total content in this course would make a nice introduction segment to a full course.
That shouldn't be possible.
Finally our questions were almost never answered.
Some misunderstanding by introduction of scrum (e.
g.
The course does cover the main subject concepts in fair amount of depth and with decent rigor.
Very basic knowledge
what steps need to be followed to complete each question.
The assignments and quizzes are also poorly written and contain spelling and sloppy mistakes, which doesn't make sense because the material isn't new.
This makes the certificate virtually worthless, although you can pay for it.
No much staff in it
Unfortunately it seems as if they ran out of time to design it properly (despite extending its start date several times).
When politicians and their pawns develop a course should we be surprised that the answer is always more government intervention?
reading/text exercises directly paired with each lesson) really hampers this.
It needs careful reviewing and more user-friendly features being introduced by the organisers.
I didn't like the professor's teaching style.
For example, what is the point of giving you a single 10-minutes video on how to do regression in Tableau if you don't even know regression (which is AT LEAST a one-term course in graduate school, and only after several other prior basic stats courses)?
For a practice course I found that was full of theory
While explanatory about the Arduino functions and structure, It should have been spread into more weeks so that it could cover more.
I'd say this course could be good for a specialization in business market analysis, but not as advertised.
I also found the cartoon classroom questions to be very annoying, almost as bad as fingernails on a blackboard.
It stops being about music and suddenly becomes a discussion about liberal social issues.
Inadequate student and teacher participation on forums, leaving students to figure things out without assistance or collaboration.
If I only knew that this course was not an instructor supervised course, I would have been willing to pay extra money just to get a professional to assess my essay and provide me with feedback.
The source should a good CV, but also has to know how to present the message.
The time spent attempting humor could have been spent on teaching, but instead a lot of time is wasted by speaking down to the viewer like they are a toddler.
Enjoy the course!
Somewhat very disappointing to me!
There were some interesting elements there but also a lot of redundancy.
I expected more.
7 hardest assignments.
more about the study of terrorism than about terrorism
Some flaws in the grading forms.
The video sound wouldn't match up in places, and the brief questions inserted into the video would come prior to us learning the content to answer the question.
I'd expect something more practical, e.
g.
Too easy, very basic
Think of it from the point of view of somebody wanting to listen and read at the same time.
Ill give two stars cause lectures are way to boring to follow.
very basic
Felt like the teachers weren't putting much time into preparation - felt random and disorganized.
I get this course since I really want to learn on boosting.
There are none.
Disappointing.
Gives you needed basics on HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the rest of the specialisation.
Content of the course and presentation was great.
Expected more!
This course seems patched together.
However, I think the professors need to work more closely with online instructional designers to make the entire series more palatable for online learning.
Let me illustrate this with a historical counterexample.
Around 75 years ago, a Canadian dentist visited my home country of Switzerland, where he examined the health and diet of a population in a secluded mountain valley.
Pretty boring and quite hard to follow.
Sometimes, doing things exactly the way shown in the video with additional fixes by both the professor and students, it still doesn't work.
I was quite disappointed by this course, after several delays the course stated months later than originally planned.
This course means well but the lectures in the first half of the course are not good.
I dropped out in first week.
Not quite the excel actually relevant to industrial requirements.
However, the information I received, at times, appeared more descriptive than informative.
As I mentioned, I know HTML well, but it was described so complex, that it was difficult to link my actual knowledge to lecturer words.3rd: not international student friendly.
The reason for the low rating was the 6th module, and the fact that I felt very ill prepared for the syntax of creating all the operations in Spark (building out the Jupiter notebook).
And during that time when you wait, you need to keep this ongoing "laundry" task in your head, so that you don't forget to take it out later on time.
Takes approximately 2 hours to complete.
cannot continue with the in-dept material but have to wait until next week (and payment ofcourse).
I finished the course without being very clear what I was asked, and I lacked more feedback when one of the tasks is wrong.
This was the paper I was most looking forward to in the Interaction Design specialisation.
Some of them ask you to "use more than one word" to respond.
That would have been much more helpful as presumably it would have had some structure to it.
Only some slides to read through, no real exercises but constant reference to the standard project management book.
Very rushed, incomplete examples and gaps in content.
This course is NOT free to submit test results.
This course started out with an ambitious goal for a MOOC in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project.
Hope the 4th one course will be better.
Phoning in it is an apt description.
The Assignments: The first assignment with Twitter was fun and interesting and gets the course 2 stars instead of one.
However the hands on assignments give great insight into understanding the basic concepts of game design and narration.
I notice that a lot of courses like these in US colleges are incredibly glorified.
Wasn't much of a class about responsive design, only one of the four weeks talked about responsive web design.
Useful in many respects, but the uninitiated to the field need more time, slow increments in project difficulty and more thorough, step by step explanations.
The accessible required reading assignments were thought provoking and topical.
However I completed the entire course in 4 hours.
Plus he didn't answer the questions that he asked.
This is a hard subject to teach myself.
The capstone project doesn't fully utilise d knowledge from earlier modules such as Machine Learning, statistical analysis, regression models n etc.
If you are wanting to be a sound designer, perhaps you would learn the vocabulary for sound design but not much "how."
The content was very shallow.
This is clearly not the right medium for Prof Clifton.
The content though important was not taught in a way to engage the student.
I think it is a very basic course, or for people who have very little previous knowledge.
Not as polished/comprehensive as the previous courses (especially week1, week5 and week6).
I had high expectations of this course, but must admit I'm pretty disappointed.
I liked the content that was presented.
The other sections just contained too many confusing, unrehearsed diversions into esoteric topics to be of much use.
Suitable neither for absolute beginners nor as a stand-alone course.
I learned more from reading other sources while taking the class than I did from the lectures.
Unfortunately- 2.
Words were added to the image during that time, but all in all there were 26 words of text on the slide.
The assignments were hard, not because of the contents of the courser, but for understanding the context of the method being implemented (what each variable meant and how it was expressed).
Also, there should be a range of submissions that could be right but having higher or lower scores depending of how long it took to find the path, or how long the path was to reach the goal.
So bascially what I got was a bunch of added on expenses and still no web site.
Assignments were marked inconsistently.
Lecturer reads off slides and gives very little supplementary information.
Is a good course to audit/browse for free but may not be good enough against a verified option.
Professors try to explain it in few lectures 10-15 minutes each and then they expect you to write couple of programs and to make some project from scratch in few days.
This course should be labelled Intermediate and Statistics should be listed as a prerequisite.
I was just very unimpressed and skipped through the program as quickly as I could /rant
A peer grader would be nice for the final project.
On-line courses can undergo continual improvement.
The part of course from Prof. Sytch and Prof. DeRue was really interesting and important.
All the modules but last are really interesting and informative.
Felt very much like an exercise in writing-by-numbers.
This course is not set up right, the assignments ask you to do things that aren't explained until the next weeks content, its kind of discouraging.
showed me 4 videos and no course instruction, am bummed really wants to take the course
going off on a tangent on how you should never take charge of somebody else's soul).
But it is doable.
They usually consist of 1-3 questions with two answers each and once choice so outrageous that they don't take any thought at all to complete.
Also plenty of references to information from other courses ("Previously we learned" "Remember the example").
Dropped the course, not that I didn't understand it, but rather it was not worth my time to play "catch-up" on my own.
I didn't know how to make cashflow assumptions.
Spend your time and money on a more valuable course like Fundamentals of Computing Specialization, which is awesome, and is about the same price as of this writing.
This course offers no challenge, little content, and the assignments let me down.
It is not enough even to learn Data Science.
The lectures are fine and the book is great, but the assignments have a lot of technical problems.
I saw two main issues with this course: 1) dated lecture videos, oftentimes with R code that can't be replicated using up-to-date packages, and 2) lack of thoughtful design: example after example after example after example doesn't really teach you anything.
-- but don't come into this believing that you'll really learn them, because that is just not possible with the time allowed.
Too much breadth and insufficient depth.
The exercises and quizzes are too simple to solve.
The course did touch on the important subject matters at hand, but since the textbook was so old (practically outdated by digital media standards), it missed or made little mention of so many innovations and best practices that are now the rule for digital marketers.
Unfortunately it's very poor material and lecturer is not expirienced yet enough :(
Sample spreadsheets could be improved in many ways and any attention to detail would do this course much good.
The final project asked us to do things that hadn't even been mentioned in the course materials.
There are no slides for the lectures, the instructor mentions chapters of a book and does not provide the materials to students pursue a more effective way of studying the materials.
No emotion.
Also, instructor jumps from one lesson to another without enough explanation how did he reach to the solution
The biggest problem is that this way the grader won't be able to give you meaningful feedback / hint of where you might be wrong.
Though content was good, but i found myself looking things up because of his somewhat neive explanations of difficult concept.
Nothing against her, she certainly taught the class and met the objectives, she just speaks too slow/articulates too precisely for me.
The autograder's idea of helpful feedback is similar to "Incorrect value.
Maybe there are people that find this stuff easy and understand it right away.
I really like the quizes.
I expected to learn advanced excel techniques, not to be required to know statistic models to apply.
Give them some stacks of paper to sort, then shown them what a correctly sorted stack looks like.
"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing" unfortunately applies to this condensed intro course.
I didn't get much help when I asked if he had altered the bs files or changed his specificity in order to get them to work.
Amy Blooms assignments were so complicated and obtuse that they were hard to dive into.
In the end, I gave up following along with the videos and built the app using my own research.
This class' information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course.
Lots of unnecessary information included in each video which make them long and boring.
Some of the videos didn't seem polished to the point that it made me think it was not the final edits?Also, from other Coursera courses, I really valued interviews and summaries that highlighted the key points (vs a summary of the topics convered).
Finally, the module quizzes didn't seem to highlight the key points, but instead had questions specific to not-so-important details (e.
g., which agency created the MB campaign).
If you have the time and resilience to search out support materials and frequently peruse the Discussion threads, you will be able to find what you need.
Hard to follow with a lot of technical intructions right off the bat with inadequate explanation, a lot of "read more about this at <insert URL>."
The main issue of this course is that the chaos in the symbol used in the second programming assignment, the lecturer cannot even main self-consistency in the symbol used.
I loose lot of time by learn with others supports than Coursera.
Even if I notice and appreciate the works to produce these supports by the teacher, I'm not a big fan at all.
clear teaching but too much basilar introduction
I never used MAC, so I had a very hard time!- Very few examples real examples are provided;- You learn math concepts, not Excel skills!
Hey look!
Content is not excellent, the trainer is just reading a text while slides are passing trough the screen, no examples, no analogies, no explanation whatsoever, I wouldn't call that a training.
Also, 59 dollars is far too expensive for such a short course.
Very basic and the lectures are short in duration.
It is more of an infomercial for American Gut than an actual course.
a nice "entry level" course lacking a forum discussion... was not even able to report some issue with videos and no explanation provided with quizzes results :/
- Assumptions about the student are not clear, before starting the course.
Instructor examples are not practical in all contexts.
Jump to dijkstra in very second week, without clarity on major C++ concepts and examples, is too much an expectation from the student switching from C to C++ for the first time.
Confusion with deadline for assignments.
too many lectures during later week courses, as if the effort is to crunch everything in that week and complete the course.
If its spaced properly with examples and problems over few more weeks, it would help.
Pretty sloppy effort.
To make things even better, accessing the quizzes is imposible unless you pay for the certificate.
All this I have learned by trial and error myself, and I completely missed the info of WHY using THIS tool and not others.
about cleaning.
No matter how many times I re-watch the lecture, I can't understand much.
Is is a User interface or is just a specified variable which can be changed in the program code?
Unless you are already in the industry, I do not think anyone can make anything impressive to be worth pitching in front of the audience.
A very slow and dull course.
A more commonly used library would have been a much better choice.
I didn't learn much new concepts or working tips that I didn't know before taking this course.
Pity
"Off-lecture help: If you take the course for the same reason I did, then thank your favorite god for the moderators in the discussion forums (mentors).
I'm on week 3 and I'm still not sure of how to make my assignments in a proper way.
For example: the final assignment at firsts asks you how to engage with your audience, and then you click next and the SAME question is now asking you how you distribute content.
I've had to guess a lot of things, video explanations were not up to the level of the assignments (I don't look for easier assignments but broader explanations).
the last week assignment on crowdsourcing it's cool but for example Mechanical Turk take 48hrs to validate you before you could start, so if you start the assignment on friday you'll barely make it and if you had time until saturday(because you work) you are doomed.
Very much low details and the course instructor has very slow pace when he is teaching on the board that (aaaa,aaaa) is very irritating....
I learned a lot about deep learning.
Good lecturers, though.
Yes, this course contains topics that are nice-to-know, but they are by no means essential or useful.
This course is great, but Brian is certainly not a good instructor.
There are some key areas of improvement:1) You should build more examples in the lectures.
The first and the last week propose basic, but self-explaining inputs in an uninteresting manner.
Great explanations provided by Prof. Waterman, however for the price of this course (in my view quite expensive) the materials available are quite poor (e.
g.
But I would have been just fine with fewer graphics if it meant more worked-through examples.
The pair review it's really not the way to go.
A better way to teach/present this course is by infusing actual, real world examples or cases throughout the lessons instead of just listing a function and talking through its corresponding activity/response.
Assignments are not always relevant or clearly explained.
If I had a say in what should be in this intro it would be one video end to end of setting up the tools.
The course fees are not particularly transparent.
I got bogged down by hex colour requirements and other ancillary requirements.
Things are not always intuitive.
No TA, staff or instructor presence during the whole course.
Example week 6 - c video how to send a ROAR from the app to the internet)
His English is quite unsuitable for video lectures!
I do not like this course being tied to a commercial product.
Too long, too diversified, too much usage of technical terms; heterogenous content.
The course is sustained by the reading material alone.
It could have been done much better specially the lectures.
Pretty hard to Keep track but the content was good.
I probably need to be a bit more focussed next time.
It is not BTW an "age thing"; I am older than he, I am sure, and do not ask that presentations be entertaining - just that they be engaging.
This is a very basic course on food and nutrition.
The course is very preliminary.
The material was appropriate and interesting and well presented.
Lots of random topics talked about .
but nothing in depth.
The course was still useful and with new information but I really found it lacking cohesion with the overall specialization and with its own content.
Tools are fantastic, but it's important to be utilizing them properly, otherwise I end up feeling like I'm wasting time.
OK content but too slowly presentedpainful experience to go through all the lessons
Also, requiring learners to upgrade to run an autograder on a quiz is ridiculous!
But...
The quality of the code is bad.
More importantly, only a very limited subset of the course is covered with the suitable and valuable video lectures.
Especially the last of the three-week course consist mostly of reading material from an external website.
The exercises after each of the three weeks are at the lower end of what I have seen on Coursera and the lecturers should consider putting more effort in creating useful questions for formative and summative evaluations of the learning progress.
In summary, smart lecturers present a very interesting and highly relevant topic, but they put to little effort in creating a compellingly online course.
This class is not challenging at all
I know I'm under-utilizing them at present, and there's good stuff there.
In spite of claims to the contrary, the Lexalytics and IBM Bluemix videos did feel like extended infomercials.
1 star for the course, the video's are longer than needed because the instructor could be telling his stories in a more structured way.
Had big expectations for this one... really one of the ones to look forward to after working through the beginning of the specialization, but for some reason, it seemed any prof or even TA interaction was absent this time around like in none of the other specialization coursed to date.
Much of the lecture and exercise focused on providing direction than actually teaching.
Interesting, and probably a great class for someone looking for the basics of marketing.
Great start.
She didn't seem interested at all in what she was teaching.
Could be better spread out over a longer duration.
Combined with the required file for each assignment, this course can easily be a torture.
And some algorithms are not even told in the course and you need to implement them!
Affirmations are most times not justified at all ("incremental prototyping will yield a feature-rich and robust software").
I was really hoping to complete the data science specialization, but I have found the first couple of courses to be not very cohesive.
If you are a math whiz who excels in algebra and can do complex mathematical equations quickly on the fly, then this course will definitely benefit you.
There are very few exercises, and there is minimal feedback on those exercises.
Yet another good course that is ruined by a peer review requirement.
Very poorly designed course material.
In some cases the 'best' answer chosen is absurd.
They weren't difficult but their reasoning were never explained in the course and it made the code a little more awkward than it needed be to pass.
Week 3 is where the major pacing problems occur.
If you haven’t covered some concept, don’t assume your students will understand it by magic.
A good teacher can make the learning experience effortless and fun, a poor teacher makes it like a torture.
Also - again in my opinion, I didn't saw a consistent approach to the materials, neither the examples given made any sense.
I didn't finish the course - I'll watch the cs193p lectures from Stanford instead.
I've only gotten started, but there seems some assumptions made about how much we know and how quickly we can pick up these new terms and ideas.
Concepts and variables are often introduced without even mentioning what they refer to.
He repeats many things through out the course and he tries to teach by asking questions all the time.
I have a degree in economics, magna cum laude, so clearly I'm not dumb.
Further, the content in the lessons does not even show or explain what is expected from the learning.
I spent the majority of my time exploring the discussions to discover what I was supposed to be doing and the rest of it on Google teaching myself the concepts that were not taught in the course.
I managed to solve all quizzes in the end, but it was some kind of a frustrating and discouraging process.
Its like mugging things for quiz.
The 5-8 hour work per week are a joke, I never needed more than 2.5h per week.
Infrastructure - probably.
Plus the little quips where he's pretending to engage with the viewer made it feel like a kids show.
Course seems to just comprise 1 or 2 minute long video lectures and then direct students to vast amounts of online reading material.
Weeks 3 & 4 were very thin, not really up to expectation based on first course or even first two weeks
Some of the algorithms are pretty cool but overall the course is not worth it.
Its planning is best summed up: “Just show them a memo, have the participants write one, and boom, success!” That one small, peer-evaluated exercise is not worth the fee.
Downloading individual files to computer and plugging into your project without overwriting your own work is a nuisance.
In particular, there are a couple of them that you can't barely understand.
Normally I prefer Lynda to Coursera for the assignments and the quizzes, but not in this case...
This shouldn't be necessary with pre-recorded lectures.
I guess an Intro level course is going to be broad and shallow, but if you are going to have assignments that require implementation then that should be better supported by the material.
I think a screenshot of the expected answer for the more advanced questions (first few rows+columns) would help a lot and save us a lot of suffering.
)And by the way it takes half a day to cover all 4 weeks material (listened through all videos, installed the tools).
Just 2 instructor standing still in front of camera and reading from a file in flat voice.
The interviews with the published authors was by far the best part of this class and I enjoyed listening to them describe their writing lives.
The android development platform is more or a less a mess compared to ios.
This course was more like a glossary.
It seemed like each section/module did not feel like a cohesive package, with each one building upon the last.
For example the different kinds of publishing were described but no time was spent on how to evaluate publishers or how to decide what might work best for the author.
I would have benefited greatly if there were more examples of how to calculate the models, including the calculations part of it.
Which are these materials, and where can they be found?- the slides could use some diagrams here and there, as the constant text screens are monotonous and make understanding harder in some cases- the course does not settle on a balance between breadth and depth of information.
Wasn"t great.
Nothing but following the lectures, hardly any quizes or assignments where you have to work things out on your own.
The homework is not very clear and you need much more time to do it than it is said.
I really just need the [meat of the video] part.
The content they were responsible for covering was why I signed up for a paid multi-course specialization.
The final project is a bit of a disaster as some of the reviewers are unable to unzip a generic '.
gz' file and you can end up getting 0 points from those particular incompetent types.
This course is not challenging at all.
The course would also greatly benefit with exercise material so you get a better feeling of calculating these things.
Much of the class was about parts of building sites that aren't relevant to building a responsive site.
It is okay to present that to the students, but you should also mention that while they are there, it is usually not recommended to use them and explain what would be the recommended practice.
I have taken courses from other sites like Codeschools, Codecademy and Treehouse and left Coursera for later because I believed that getting a certificate would require me to have some expertise, but so far I feel kind of disappointed with the Full Stack package.
I am hoping it will get better with the next modules.
The teachers are easy to like, but the course content is very lightweight and will mostly teach you terminology with no real understanding.
The worst part was the assignments, which could all be solved by a little copy/paste: I didn't learn anything useful by doing them.
In the final week, the dictionary of state names is counterproductive in answering part one (some state names are region names) and one can either get 100% or one fails the course (as one question is worth 50% of the grade.
Instructor and mentors added not value to course.
I found the course rather difficult, with respect to the other courses I did on Coursera.
Overly academic
Great information, however, the professor who is clearly a specialist just stood and read the lectures.
Very basic, rather simple
The problem is: some of your audience will know and will notice, more often than you might think and you will end up looking like an idiot.
Sorry to be negative here, but I think I owe you, my co-student, at least a warning: do learn more stats elsewhere!!
The lectures can also benefit from a recalibration, because the lecturer speaks way too fast for newbies and speaks fastest when explaining the most complex concepts.
Please review your next courses in the specialization not to be parts of your previous course but to have new materials...
so many recommendations that have little 'science' behind them, and which have not produced good results for 95% of the people who have used them.
They tell you a number of pre-required packages you have to install, including ones you had installed from previous assignments, but they leave out others you will need and leave several development environment issues you end up having to work out on your own.
And where as the week 2 assignment was almost overly hand-holdy on showing you where in a ruby file structure to implement your code, week 3 hardly offers any guidance on where or how to implement your Rails structure.
The course must rise above only a few definitions and rough concepts.
The professor explain you complex concepts like entropy or binary classification to continue with an excel worksheet.
I can only imagine how novices may take to the lessons.
I don't like pay to submit courses.
The presenter emphasizes every other word and talks in a very unnatural manner that makes it very tiring to listen to, and the in-video quizzes are far too basic and take up too much time.
They can request multiple answers but have single question boxes and/or the reverse.
It is sad.
I expected much more information in videos.
We need to wholesale changes in how we think about our society if we want it to be sustainable; not, we have problems over here and here and here, and if we put this bandaid on it, that might fix it for a while.
Instructor seem uninterested, and the constant hair flipping was distracting.
They were boring and basically repeated everything given in the readings.
While the content of the course is interesting and useful, the delivery desperately needs improvement.
There really is very very little material in this course.
Didn't provide much info beyond the basics of git.
The content is OK, but that's about it.
Too short lectures;The study material is not properly defined, only entire books to read as reference;The tasks/tests are all literal parts of the books to complete, no understanding of the subject is motivated, but memorizing and tiring reading of books without proper directions.
This is widely discussed field as subjective and objective career success.2) In addition to SAME - better instruments/scale those are easily available online.3) Some better links to career related articles from Harvard/California management review or organization dynamics on the topics covered.
Less lab exerciser only theoretical introduction
For example, he said, "Evolution happens for a reason."
It's a real shame because the syllabus correctly addresses a gap in most data scientists' skills.
i.
e.
It is not very clear.
Not enough implication from the instructors in the course.
There IS a difference.
For example on week 4 the exercises do nothing with futures even though there's 6 lectures on them.
The course has a lot of interesting material, but I believe that a few points may be improved:1) Exercises with Matlab are not programming ones (except for the PD controller).
I enjoyed some explanation in videos and fun teachers, but in general, I'm really happy I haven't paid for this course.
But the effort that Berklee put into it is nothing compared to what they give to students, on their official website.
My suggestions:** videos: pace is way too fast, and without much visuals and a clear structure/plan, hard to fully grab in one view.
The presented material wasn't coherent for me, I didn't walk away with knowledge of functional design principles for larger/complex software.
Again, I wish the teachers would explain explicitly what is needed for the programming exercise.
If you think this is an introduction to Java programming language you are wrong.
What do you want?
Forum didn't help either.
Material does not map well to the quizzes.
So I had high hopes going into this course.
Lecture videos: I cannot begin to tell you how many times I fell asleep watching the video lectures.
I was expecting an intro course for beginners... this was not it.
The course is interesting, but I doubt that anyone would pay to attend this course.
Most importantly, I do not believe the course leaves behind an effective understanding of the material that would allow you to apply it.
Additionally, I was graded negatively by some reviewers without reason, as happened in other sections.
It was too easy and very basic.
Way too general..
If I wanted a reference guide, I'd just pick up one of the various handbooks/books on the markets that list R codes and their functions.
The end of course project literally being just to make a Github account and download R-studio could be quickly covered in the first week of the other courses.
Most of them can be both justified or refuted.
This was really basic information.
All of these areas were only touched on in very minor ways and with little learned.
The pronunciation of the lector was more than awful!
Even inept and cheesy graphics would be better than nothing.
One: the quiz questions are often opaquely worded.
Processes where they say things like "Requirements combined with processes are the backbone of any successful software project."
And the lecturer basically is reading from the power point
Not up to the standard of the previous two courses.
Secondly, this course did NOT cover CHILD NUTRITION, it covered general nutrition.
Poor concepts exposition with a bad teaching method.
(And one trip through the forums will illustrate that I am not the only one.
I live in the US and have graduate degrees in public health .
It would also be helpful to rewrite (or at least include a reference back to) the equation being used in the example calculations instead of immediately filling numbers in.
The course a materials are interesting and with significant value, same comment on the teachers, this would be perfect if the third party(the VM) is working fine, I can't say I'm happy about the course where the frustration is probably the right word describing my feeling right now, wish me luck for this week, I might pass might not ......
Recursion over lists can be a nice mind exercise but please don't use it in real world, there are way too many stack overflows, unneeded context switches and cryptic code already, don't add to it.
The statement of everything in both PA1 and PA2 is also very confusing.
Bad or superficial explanations.
Mr. Campbell's presentations are quite boring and consist of a handful of phrases repeated over and over again.
Definite downgrade from previous courses, especially from the first three.
Instructors pointing at virtual points on screen does not help at all.
For pay quiz feedback is not part of the MOOC education movement.
If it is not shown up to be graded by other students then you are left grade-less for that assignment hence leaving you unable to complete this course and you cannot receive your certificate or completion letter.
My peers with programming experience confirmed that there is too wide a gap between the content delivered in the video lectures and the demands of the coding assignments.
If I wasn't already familiar with statistics, I would find the lectures and course book difficult to follow.
It is too high level and not many examples or assignments.
Enroll in!
Its a teachers guide.
However, if you're taking this course to learn Tableau, I would suggest not paying for it.
It wasn't all that helpful nor engaging.
Poorly executed.
Lectures were extremely good, but assignments and graders were very low quality and difficult to decipher requirements from.
The speakers are not engaging and it just looks like no effort was made in preparing this course.
there was no home works
"To do this and that, would you use technology A, B, or C?"
They are covering the similar topics but this class has fallen short on most of the subject.
Lecture time is very little.
Only take this course you have to.
This is the only course in this specialization that doesn't seem to belong with the rest of the material.
It's supposed to be a course for beginners.
I did guesswork in almost all the quizzes after week 2 which further adds to my disappointment.
I think the Robotics specialization is better off without this course because there is little or no value addition here.
lectures on projective transformation).
The assignment guide is very unclear in some parts.3e.
I expected we would get some data set we would use to apply the analytics skills we learned.
There is too much noise.
They course instructors should provide more information to begin with that it is essential to watch the videos and read the course material almost before the new week starts because of the fact that groups needs to be created and discussions and research with teammates have to be coordinated.
Teaching seems unprofessional and disorganized, technical issues are common, and the discussion forums do not offer much value, as you cannot discuss your code with your peers, and the forum staff are more than often unhelpful.
For example, Israelis recall that Palestinian founding father Haj Amin al-Husseini was a Nazi agitator in Europe and bequeathed an anti-Jewish ideology (Netanyahu even made a speech about this in 2015 that was covered internationally).
No technical staff around to help, only one or two examples of how the math works, and a general poor explanation of the concepts.
This course is not for beginners, and I recommend you steer clear if you do not posses at minimum a bachelors in mathematics.
Please include exercises for computing the ratios and the valuation methods.
While the topic is interesting, the materials are poor and the lectures are not particularly insightful.
HTML and CSS classes were great, but JavaScript classes were very confusing and difficult to understand.
It is much more like a pratictioner course.
The concepts are not very clear.
It jumps in with overviews but contain some high level items you won't understand until later in the course and it really doesn't give enough context to be meaningful at the time.
I found the lectures a bit uninspiring.
I'm disappointed with the peer grading system but even more with this kind of attitude from a "mentor".
:-\ I think that it's geared to too wide of an audience, so we didn't get as specific as I was anticipating.
Good as overview, but pretty shallow.
Students repeatedly pointed this out only to get directed again to the non-existant link.
It is a kind of introduction course as it was mentioned on course info, however it is very basic.
If there would be follow up courses about the same topic it is a good start, otherwise that is not a learning based lecture.
Thank you for your understanding.
Deniz Ozalp
The lectures are very basic, but that makes sense for an intro-type course.
I thing this course should have one or two more modules.
A lot of the concepts in Stats Inf - although simple when you think about it and used pretty much every day - I felt were difficult to understand at first.
The lectures tend to be a bit boring.
To me is unacceptable.
If you're looking for a physic course to build the base for Mechanical Engineering, highly recommend this one.
Course needs an update to materials and either teach AND test theory, or teach AND test praxis.
I felt the initial splash screen was a bit time consuming, also lot of the knowledge felt like more bookish.
I can get much more thorough instruction from Code Academy for free or low cost.
This course is not well designed, there are multiple mistakes in the videos, assignments, etc.
Would have loved a more engaging format.
Excellent material, good organization and presentation.
Then, if you really need the certificate, pay and retake the course.
Much of its content was enthralling, inspiring and very useful practically.
Lacks explanation of "why" through all the videos, simply giving you information to remember "If you do this, this will happen".
Interactivity with JavaScript was too quick and short.
As the course is currently designed, you either get 100% or 0%!
Questions seem geared towards school children.
Lack of examples, sometimes it is not easy to understand what lesson is about
Powerpoint slides were never offered in this course even though they were supposed to be.
to make your point due to technical limitations (can't paste charts or screenshots).
Sometimes verification does not work.
Support is sometimes very good, sometimes useless, depends with whom you chat.
Either there are serious limitations with this iteration of the Coursera platform or the course authors did not understand how to properly implement this.
Finally, in the session I took their was no active Teaching Assistance presence.
I I felt the videos with Tiffany were unnecessary and a waste of time.
It's ok. Reading the top three books on time management would take less time and provide far more insight and inspiration.
1/5This course is super boring.
The capstone project is interesting but requires far too much time compared to the other courses and to what is announced.
Also seeing how many students misinterpret the assignments, it makes me nervous that they are the ones grading mine.
Very very basic course.
The videos provide you with tons of information, but not much of them are well-organized.
There's room for improvement, aspects are unnecessarily convoluted.
By reading off a script they are forced to "hand-wave" and do not explain concepts covered completely.
The only thing I liked about this course were the problem sets, which were interesting to do.
Very very entry level information.
But useful techniques nevertheless.
From week 3 onward the assignments were badly worded, and that distracts the learning.
I really think the instructor is an intelligent man, but I'm not quite sure he understands how to teach well.
Not useful, learned very little from it.
Lots of detail.
The presentation in some of the modules is perhaps an example of how not to do it, reading fro a script in a monotonous voice.
waste of time.
Lots of cutting edge mathematical and computer vision concepts, but a serious lack of support.
Not worthy at all.
Not as useful as I thought it would be, but maybe I should have read the introduction better:)
This was painful.
Coursera may wish to review whether it continues offering this course.
Fairly disappointing compared to the first week of this course.
We typically work hard, the organization of this course my you to suffer.
The Assignments are more of Trial and Error and not very helpful.
Video interviews which are part of the curriculum are mostly not useful.
First of all, let's note that the course covers quite more advanced topics than the previous 3 courses in the specialization, so some extra difficulty is to be expected.
If no examples have been covered, how can a quiz-taker be expected to create the proper tags?
The MatLab work is interesting but barely explained.
can't wait to rate this course!
Having to pay just to take the quizzes for an overview course is kind of a joke.
If you're looking for a very light overview of some introductory psychological principles, this course is for you, otherwise, don't waste your time.
For the same price, Analytics Edge at EdX is far better choice for practical machine learning.
I had to buy Matlab.
This is a core course in the specialization.
The quizzes are out of the material's league
Please put that up front in the course description.
Maybe my expectations were too high.
Also, each lecture comes with an additional spreadsheet that needs to be studied.
Course would be much better if it gives real tips and techniques rather than constant repetitions of the same information in different forms.
A few of the assignments have been weird, not so good brief and hard to find out how to do it correct and well.
When I managed to correct where he'd left me in the dark, I found that my class assignments failed to override the bootstrap defaults.
- but I'm not, there's no programming at all.
I shy away in disgust form this untyped IDE-unfriendly monstruosity.
loops appear in earlier weeks).
I took the free option.
This course is not as good as the ones that are part of the Digital Marketing specialization.
Making this course quite hard to follow.
Disclosure: English if my first language.
Hope this helps!
Can only be suitable to those, who already know the subject well and can use some additional facts that are randomly presented in this "course".
One review was a single word, "nice."
There was very little actual content in this course, and I can't say I learned very much.
Poorly structured.
Bloated.
Discontinuous content.
It also ends up focusing more on music analysis than music theory - while there is a relationship between these 2 approaches I did not embark on this course to become an analyst - as a practising musician I wanted to understand more of the concepts behind what I do and hear.
Profoundly knowledgeable, but very soft spoken Professor - was difficult to maintain interest and energy especially in this remote learning medium.
Decided to table this course for a while and revisit when my learning attitude is calmer and more in-line with his communication style.
There is no real accountability when it comes to grading work, as work is peer graded and students grade capriciously without regard for the criteria laid out in the lecture.
The content is generally interesting, but not presented in a cohesive way.
Not the best course of the serie.
Just a random slide put in as an afterthought.
Instead it is sort of much higher level except that the instructor fails to stay at the high level and will suddenly go deep - but without providing the detail so that someone to whom this is new will be totally lost.
The questions were out of order, the videos and lectures were terrible and dry
I might revisit programming assignments again once I have more time and more experience with the application, just for the sake of completing the course, but I kind of find it silly that I need experience with R to pass the course intended for people with little to no experience with R.
The actual educational aspects of the course are interesting and insightful but the requirement to grade the work of others makes this course a chore to get through.
There were some real technical problems in this course.
This was an interesting course, however there were bugs and errors in most of the assignment materials, which really impaired the learning experience since much of it was reduced to debugging the course organiser's code... Also the 3rd and fourth sections, including assignments, seemed to be rather small and to cover very little material, with little or no supporting material.
All the above basically means that passing the weekly assignments takes longer than you may assume.
I have followed several other courses ( also Python in Coursera set up) and this one really disappointed me ( I'm in wk 2 out of 4 now).
I know this is just module 1, but the content didn't feel valuable for the most part.
I understand there are some limitations in working with such a large and diverse group of students, but peer-reviewing is not productive or particularly helpful, and I expected more interaction with the professors for a capstone (especially one that comes at a cost).
There are transitioning economies around the globe in dire need of start ups and the overall entrepreneurship spirit of Silicon Valley.
I always felt like coming back and learning more with the other two lectures but with this one I had to force myself to complete the lessons.
Not exactly sterling knowledge transfer, from instructor to student!
It is very easy and somehow less impacting on real business problem.
So I'll start with the positives.
I would sacrifice the fancy real-time visualization to save some time.
No adjustment was made to the due date.
Requirements for the final project are vague and confusing and I am not able to submit the final project by the due date in about 2 hours.
What strategical decisions did it involve that were not related to marketing?
peer-reviewed assignments for such a short course.
I, on the other hand, prefer learning by doing.
It's just droning on and on about concepts and how they work.
Yes it's important to learn what these things do, but it's much more important to put them to practice.
The lecturers are speaking very fast.
Am waiting for another 8 hours before I can reattempt the quiz.
Personally, I feel that this course assumes the student is automatically an expert in statistics (simply due to completing the first intro to statistics course).
For the third Course in the Python specialisation this is a very basic 6 weeks.
We took a data set and further complicated it by abstracting into various object classes.
Really long running times to test if the parameters work fine.
You never even see anyone draw to my recollection.
The 'work' in the course feels rather 'phoned in' at times too.
Learners are left behind shooting bullets at the sky hoping to hit a star that might fall over with some hints.
Very heavy focus on charts and graphs....
so there's a lot to it but very little you can sink your teeth into unless you have a very specific type of management in mind.
Feedback from course participants is not very valuable unfortunately.
Please stop reading from the screen, it looks ridiculous.
This just wasn't the right course for me.
I was disappointed by this Course maybe because I had a great expectations for it.
Also, I have non-trivial experience with Stata.
As for myself I felt that I was wasting time and money.
I don't feel like it was worth my $39, and would love to see this class completely redesigned for future learners.
Even the assignments were a re-hash of the ones from the first course.
A large part of the content each week was simply reading a presentation which you could get from a book.
This is also true when looking at these students' games- when half of your grade depends on your clarity, these kids are ultimately at a disadvantage.
This is the poorest Coursera course I have participated in.
The assignments feel like tedious filler an a lot of the questions in them are very poorly worded.
I spend tons of time on google search, reading docs and go over other people's post on various forums in order to find the right way(sometimes optimal way) to finish the assignments.
Somehow general.
Epic fail.
Should give an example on how these math skills are used in data science.
They were hard for completely the wrong reasons.
This course is the first one in the Data Science series to lapse in terms of the clarity of the lectures, and the sense of cohesiveness of the material.
Great that non-native speakers are trying to write in English, enriching the canon, but in those circumstances a pass/fail system seems misguided.
This course is informative and introductory.
I'm not even sure how the smartphone components fit together, or what they actually do.
It would be a really interesting course if there were more examples, such as how smartphone components work together or a deeper comparison between the iOS and Android systems is used when discussing the development timeline of each model, instead of pure cognitive knowledge being read from a slide.
Maybe these concepts are explored further in the other courses for this certificate, but as a stand alone introduction to smartphone technologies the information is poorly imparted.
Mere two peer reviewers per submission turned peer reviewing into a kind of lottery.
I found myself learning almost everything for the programming assignments from the pandas package documentation and from Google searches that led to stackoverflow.
very boring lectures, the professor should not read the slides, but actually try to speak her own words, because this is causing lost interest and as a result less attention paid and less knowledge received.
I will switch to other "not recommended" packages in the later parts of this specialization.
They should put the disclaimer for Graphlab Create in the specialization page so people can be aware of this.
Besides, the sound of that Giraffe toy is really, really annoying.
Although the topics are great and very interesting, especially because I am a teacher who face many of the situations mentiones, the videos are very hard to understand and I needed to put subscribe all the time.
Ilkay Altintas, who is the main lecturer, is a sweet woman, but lecturing from a manuscript is not her strongest side.
A large portion of the course is just copy and pasting code that is provided to you.
No structure for the course
Honestly didn't learn much from this course.
The course did not discuss the pros and cons of each type of visualization (e.
g., pie chart vs. line graph vs. column chart etc but of course more complex because we are using tableau) with the type of question and answers you are looking for.
If future revisions to the course are made, consider including a cheat sheet with the notation, parameter abbreviations used, etc.
Leaves a flat and unrealistic image of the subject.
?In Summery: The content in the lectures are a good but shallow overview of journalism, but don't expect to be challenged to do anything but fill in ovals and regurgitate questions.
Not too much to learn here.
This is too high level for a machine learning course.
A good intro to the tools required for a Data Scientist.
abstract and uninformative stories about some photographersbut not about the profession of the photographer or the technical side of the workThank you for the opportunity to get acquainted with the course
The course material is interesting and moves at a robust pace and I do think they have made an effort despite the fact that much of it appears lifted from one PhD student's dissertation.
This is the second part of the Robotics Specialization and compared to the first part, this course was very weak.
Good course materials and the assignment itself is pretty good, but the grader is buggy, not informative and wasted a lot of my time.
No more practice or example to help the learner understand or apply that concept to their writing.
As I said before, a more practical approach would be more rewarding.3) Quizzes were sometimes based on intuition, or topics outside of the course, rather than topics learned from the lessons.
On the other side, the TAs were highly involved in the course.
thinks it's a cool course.
but am getting it getting the concepts of the functions.
presenters would read mathematical definitions verbatim from the slides and move on.
Why?- the tests trip you on little bits of trivia, as opposed to assess your understanding of key concepts.
I got more out of the books I borrowed from the library in the same timeframe.
I feel like I learned a little bit, but don't feel like it's information I'll retain for long since I have no idea how to use much of the information for my purposes.
All questions remained unanswered (except by other students), and frustrated calls for help and advice were ignored.
The too big to fail are bigger today (by a large margin) and interest rates are too low (remember the search for yield was the motivation for the creation of the exotic securities which blew up the system).
Instead, the quizzes usually have questions that make you gofer for irrelevant info, made to test if you've gone through the reading.
I didn't think there were many solid pointers...
and not much that was original coming from the instructor herself.
The course tackles an interesting topic: why do we enjoy music?But there are two problems with this course:1) It fails to provide convincing evidence for its claims; the evidence is circumstantial and flimsy.2) The lecturer is, how shall I say this politely, monotonic.
It felt more like a beta version.
It helps you build your essay-writing muscles gradually.
I would have liked information on how to better utilize the information I get from Twitter, Pinterest, and Facebook's built in analytics tools as well.
an easy one
Very basic even for people with no DS background.
Issues with quiz having passed and results showing as failed.
Poor video and audio quality.
This course is rather superficial, it sadly did not provide practical tips that go beyond common sense.
The course is for people having advanced knowledge in embedded architecture and knowledge.
it has a lot of nice information about the brain and ways of study, but this whole course is a way of procrastinating.
I feel like it could have been summed up really much better into written text and finished at a much faster rate.
The lectures' videos are available intergrally on youtube, whereas on Coursera there are some parts that are missing.
You need to simplify it a little more
For example, programming a rimless wheel or a SLIP template.2) The course has a strong emphasis in theory.
Lectures are poor and assignments are well below average.
I did not enjoy this one.
It was decent, but it was not a five star course.
Good introductory type course but when there are issues a student is having that no other peer can resolve, the instructors are almost NEVER available to assist.
Most of them are not readable - many fonts, many colors, some with complicated pictures, some with no information at all.
Good material, let down by instructors.
Due to change from xcode 7 to 8, important parts of these lectures are outdates.
Rather than addressing with marketing and messaging, they should encourage the instructors to improve the course.
It wasn't even always clear what the numbers on the template referred to and two of the numbers were missing.
When the heck do you actually start programming?
If you have ANY programming experience, you might be better with a more advanced course.
Since the lecturer sometimes is unclear - this is problematic.
It sure would help to enter this course with a certain background of probability.
Sorry to say, but for me as a non-native english speaker, most videos are hard to follow.
At present the course is mediocre to bad: its educational value is low: transcripts are disgusting, they are not proofread, omitted pats of sentences, inconsistent English, they almost completely obscure, disrupt the sense of the presentation.
The presentations are sloppy and vague.
Given the flaws with the current session, it seems that the provider just wants to reap some easy money from students attracted by a current and interesting topic an a well-known name (Geoffrey Hinton).
Sorry but he puts me to sleep.
I can only infer that this course's target audience is rich pregnant women who care about shoe shopping and celebrities.
This course was actually quite helpful for learning Chinese, and it provides fascinating information about Chinese culture.
This is a part of the data specialization; from afar, I would not be interested in Machine Learning because of this course.
Too many concepts were crammed into.
The course materials is consistent and very well informed but, as mentioned mentors/tutors since course began never showed up to clarify some frequent issues with Matlab codes and input data.
Felt disappointed!!
The course is poorly organised: There is a project on week one that requires knowledges of week two.
The last assignment of the course is, compared to the others, more difficult.
Probably I am biased by just having followed edX's Minds and Machines.
No one reacts on the forum any more.
The instructor occasional made mistakes or was repetitive.
While I agree part of the experience is having to search and figure things out yourself, this goes beyond what I would expect.
The lectures are too brief and do not go into details pertinent to the main theses of the course.
No functional examples are provided in the lectures and the real learning content is linked out to web resources.
Professors very hard to understand, and videos don't have the best editing.
Also extremely math heavy, lectures being just math formulas, without a lot of real life applicability (ex.
It's a good topic.
As someone with little programming experience, this course was extremely challenging and I don't think the information taught was enough to successfully complete the course.
Good course but I dont like how you have to finish each module within a week it would be better if you could finish everything in fourweeks
In my opinion part of the reason I found it difficult is that the material is not explained very well.
The content of the course is good.
I give up.
Not exactly an astute observation that we couldn't glean anywhere but this course.
Honestly, my 4th Edition copy of "The Screenwriters Bible" is five times more helpful than this course, and it is about six years out of date.
The excercises should be set up to be more comfortable.
Main issues I encountered in the course:- many videos end with a suggestion to "refer to the suggested materials for more information".
The Course Material and Content is good.
Referring people to the Bootstrap docs as reference defeats the purpose of an instructor.
Other coursera courses provided an excellent balance of content and courseload, I'm disappointed that this course wasn't one of them.
Most of it is life skills that you simply pick up over time.
Yes, it's often told in an overview-style explanation what a function is doing, but something in depth that tells you how to write working javascript functions is lacking.
The quality of the explanations also varied in their quality.
Emphasis is placed on the student's teaching themselves and learning through experience with no attempt to actually understand the learning process or rest the course design on a scientific basis.
And maybe it is me, maybe I was not born to be a statistician.
There was too much focus on the conceptual data with very little emphasis on practical application of the material.
Quizzes had no connection to the lectures either.
Not beginner friendly, might be good as a refresher for grad students
If you're weighing whether to attend an in-person course or program or go with this specialization to save some $, just know that you'll get what you pay for.
The instructors often speed through significant concepts and are generally unable to explain the concepts clearly to someone who does not have a major statistics background.
The assignments are challenging but also very exciting.
Excellent!But I couldn't complete the course without payments.
Somewhere in there are some good ideas for making healthy food for kids but given I'm probably of similar politics to what they're pushing and I found it obnoxious I think they're alienating a lot of people.
there was 1 concept taught in the first lesson that of density.
All the information discussed were already present in the slides.
Video lectures are really bored, bad presented and almost useless.
Big difference in difficulty between the math-heavy codec theory lectures and the other material which is quite basic.
I didn't learn what I would've expected and all of the assignments blurred into one another
Quiz questions are unnecessarily complex - which (IMHO) will discourage / turn off those who are new to this subject matter in completing this course.
I'm not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren't used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them.
Lastly, there were many mistakes with grammar and spelling in the written portions.
The course is really trivial.
It will be too hard.
She struggles through the entire presentation which is just super distracting.
I really need to learn data warehousing for my job and I have no problem with learning by doing.
The stress should be somewhere else.
Some more advanced learners will also find some tools to be out-of-date and some areas - very Google-focused.
And I hate the last one week.
Informative but did not really feel like it was of any use.
Some questions, referring to budgets and site layouts, required skills that weren't learned in the course.
The course is good for those who have no previous knowledge on the subject and wish to learn the basics regarding Egypt, its gods, mummies etc.
In a class with such a short span (1 week), it’s very important that everything works and any questions/concerns are immediately addressed/resolved.
Please consider making the lab instructions available for download (say, as PDF files).
Sadly, even with faster speed, the lectures are also poorly structured.
Please, study Aaron Allston works before inventing other words).
Test are cool.
I decided to completely ignore it and develop my own strategy, which turned out to be far simpler and easier to implement.3f.
Video lectures did not provide much information.
I didn't learn much beyond what I already knew before I started.
Erroneously defining fiat money early in the course.
Compared to the first three courses in this specialization this course is very unstructured.
For example in this assignment you only build a relations between classes and marker on a map for only CityMarkerMap.
java class and in the next module you implement LandMarker.
java and so on.
There is no any Discusson forums in there.
The quizzes and assignments are out of order with the materials being presented - the questions on each come from readings and lecture content that have not been introduced to the audience at that particular point in the course.
The exercises are unoriginal and do not require much creative thinking - often it's enough to copy & paste code from the lectures and change a few variables around!
All of them are "implement this.
Some good information but very much a political course, not much of an economics course.
Only few starting videos give new information and techniques, the rest 80% is quite useless.
so i couldnt finish the course.
I was disappointed by the Capstone.
The last assignment is a time-waster and really poorly designed.
There were numerous quiz questions that I think they just had coded wrong on their end.
Looking at the discussion boards I believe my sentiment is shared.
This course is not prepared as well.
And the peer review assignments are mind-numbing.
Unfortunately there are a number of areas that need work:1 - Inconsistencies and errors in the material.
I wonder if those new to these topics learnt anything
Nor can one see one's answers to quizzes once done., nor standard answers provided.
Part with Map reduce is just slightly touched, not explained in details, without examples.
Otherwise it could be very promising.
This whole thing is about exposure, not deep understanding.
Want to learn the guitar?
This course contains too few solid content.
It provided great "lay advice" with little to no research base.
Absolutely not apropriate for very beginners.
If you're interest isn't mainly in Tableau, I would recommend the course.
Good lectures, but no exercises or assignments.
annual report, executive interviews, etc.
1-week does not seem enough for a Crash Course
Can you imagine?
As it is, no more than a 2/5 is possible to rate this course.
Too much information is just omitted or taken for granted.
Uncomfortable to watch and also a very outdated layout of the course, feels like a bad 90s American talk show.
I felt abandoned by the faculty when I was trying to work out the programming exercise.
I don't know who finally passed me, I think the peer review process is a shambles, and it lets Coursera personnel out of the process of doing grading and opens a can of worms with an incompetent peer reviewer having the power to not pass me.
Un-enrolling.
Not recommended for medium or advanced users.
I would not pay for the certificate unless you need one per se.
I found that modules 1 and the communications part of module 3 were useful.
There is not much guidance or support from course organizers, which makes this course not very educative.
Really disappointing.
I feel this would have made more sense after an introduction to the material.
I also did not like that the free version of the course did not allow you to complete any of the assignments, as this has not been the case in my other Coursera courses.
The content is covered after you already had to apply it in an assignment in a previous lesson.
With scikit-learn as a great open source package, the only reason (I suspect) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose.
Many problems and mistakes found in the assignment programs and I felt a lack of staff assistance on helping solving them.
Too much of it has to do with the changing of colours.
The videos were so terrible in explanation, clarity, and relevance that I ended up going to YouTube to watch the topics, and other websites to read the content relevant to the subjects.
We hear what we heard before.
I would not recommend this course.
It is two hard for beginners, or the lectures should be more detailed because assignments are hard.
The Module Overview and Module Recap videos are sufficient to serve that purpose.
Overall, I learned the basics and will probably take the next GIS course because I like the Coursera framework, but I think this particular course could be much more condensed.
Might be an instructive course but the guy who presents it is really creepy.
So much disjointed information....
There are definitely better courses out there.
It was quite difficult to go through transcripts of interviews because they were interrupted by the interviewer.
I have gone through 7 courses on Coursera and finished them with the biggest pleasure and great results.
Months of delay and poor content.
In my experience, this course has a huge gap.
how much food equal to 1000 calories?
What the teacher said and complemented with the lectures didn't match with the question answers.
I didn't learn a whole lot -perhaps it is because I'm not coming into a professional setting as a newbie anymore?
It isnt basic.
Sometimes I wondered if Tucker was really knowledgeable about the domain that he tried to teach in this course.
I'd only recommend this course if want to learn about CAPM, Sharpe ratio, and 'event profiling'.
A basic course but not for the ones who don't know anything about java or android.
Very basic overview of personal branding.
And the whole design is really destructing!
It is ironic that a course about virtual instruction is one of the worst online courses I have taken.
Great course, but it's misleading.
There was no feedback, so as a learner it was hard to grow from errors.
You will have to Google your way through this class because the provided instruction will not contain answers to the quiz or exam questions.
Very basic course.
Of course the course isn't responsible for this, but an appropriate name would fix that.
Throughout the course, the quizzes were entertaining - but the quality of the questions is questionable.
It is not possible to participate when there are technical difficulties like this.
The lectures glossed over topics that where only minimally supported by brief supplementary lectures provided by the teaching assistants.
Another example is how email marketing has moved to rules-based and triggered workflows.
2nd time trying this.
I am sure if you are familiar with the content or an expert programmer looking for an overview of a new language then this would be perfect but you do need to understand swift before starting this introduction to swift.
The lessons felt very unstructured, unplanned and ad hoc almost like the people presenting didn't know they were being recorded, this meant that the examples given were contrived without consideration to the suitability to present the concept succinctly and would require anyone but an existing swift programmer needing to carry out additional reading which rather defeats the purpose of an "introduction to..." course.
A little scripting and lesson planning and preparation of content would have made the difference between this excellently produced and edited course being awkward and an effort to attend into a really useful reference for beginers of swift programming.
To summarise, the obviously expert technical knowledge of the speakers and the quality of the editing are let down by rushed lesson content.
It was not a fun experience trying to change around my code to figure out what the autograder wanted.
I don't recall anything '...
for Android' about the coding.
Some of the lecturers are so bad at speaking that it's painful to listen to.
I understand that this is a project centered course, however I do not feel like I walked away with a solid foundation of what goes into creating synthesizer sounds.
too basic, the 4 courses of this specialization could be just one course.
A very good and thought provoking course.
It is a re-run of an archived course and sadly a number of reference materials that had been on the dashboard are not reposted with it.
There were some good nuggets of info, but there was too much filler to get to it.
I felt like to much basic info about marketing especially traditional vs digital advertising.
A lot of reading material is unavailable (link does not work or it is behind paywall).
I also found the videos lacking.
From the title I thought this would give information about the "global energy business" but the focus is generally on the US, except for portions that discussed location/ use of global resources and demand and supply levels globally.
But you end up having to figure out a lot of that either off site (in which case you are not learning from the course) or by modifying a copy paste of some of the templates/scaffolding from the course GitHub content, in which case you don't get a good reinforcement of the material.
In the end I wound up getting a certificate, feeling like I passed despite the course rather than because of it.
I'm very disappointed in this series.
Only very very basics.
Very basic collection of concepts.
I found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on.
Hope the next course in specialization "iOS App Development with Swift" would be much better.
Too basic and superficial.
(Final Grade 91.4%).
I could barely keep myself engaged.
Unfortunately, this is a far less useful course than the companions in the specialization.
The course information is very interesting but covers the material too briefly.
This course is way too basic, so basic it doesn't even cover some of the essential basics, like explaining what the Box Model is in CSS.
There are some link to websites where you can learn much more and which are not even written by the professor.
There were a couple times that the instructor was inaccurate about a some of the concepts he was teaching.
Just some common things.
This course covers very interesting topics, but there are some serious shortcomings in the lectures.
too bored
I found it difficult to make it through more than 15 minutes of content.
I gave more than 1 star because the links underneath the slides contain some valuable information, so if you can be bothered trawling through the slides you can gleam some knowledge there.
Hopefully the creators of the course take on board the many negative reviews and give a major overhaul to the course, to bring it in line with the quality of almost all other content on Coursera.
The "why" and "how" of most modules fit to the meaning we are forming (up to week 5 -the point I am leaving this class) is not evident.
Very formal and difficult to follow.
Surely what a modern day presentation needs is a modern impartial historical analysis of the subject.
Suggest replace it with standard Python as the standard tool for this class.
There are errors in the video's and without the help of the UCI help forum it is hard to get the assignments right.
I expected more discussions in the videos with variance between visual, heavy calculations at a slower pace and high-level applications.
Videos are to short to understand details and goals, what I will learn, how to use mathematic formulas?
It requires you to use a lot of personal information - I did not do well on a peer graded assignment because I didn't give out enough information about what my teaching level is.
That being said, it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given non-programmers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers.
But it's not.
The video lectures were videotaped a bit strangely, with Professor Fine often seeming to talk to an invisible person on the right or the left of the camera, instead of at the viewer.
Final assignment is too difficult to do for beginners.
Second, the section about joining a community and then faking your way to gaining credibility by posing as a newbie etc--especially by marketers--is highly reviled by many SM communities.
I miss a proper buildup from the theory to the practical exercises.
It is probably because I don't have Adobe Lightroom software.
However the quality of the lectures are pretty low.
Anyways, paying for verified course is subject to personal value derivation.
While I had rated earlier for the above reasons before the course finished.
I wanted an introduction to Python for someone who knows a some programming already.
Just confusion.
Would NOT recommend and definitely would not pay 79 USD for.
interesting course to support previously knoledgement or improve it.
The assignment guides are written with very poor grammar.
I had reported to resolve the issue but nothing happened the issue persists.
I like the professor...
but the activities and projects always had errors and issues that weren't easily fixable.
The course has many mistakes, especially the quizzes solutions.
I think the time could have been better used doing a deeper dive with Klout and SocialMention.
A tough score, which I have mixed feelings about as there was good stuff in here too.
People evaluating others performances, themselves don't know how they are suppose to evaluate.
the subtitles sometimes don't accurately represent what he's saying.
An evaluation is always tied to the value it provides in relation to the paid price.
On the plus side:1) It provides an interesting historical perspective of Search Engines, their evolution and the evolution of the algorithms and their purposes.2) Rebeka May talks slowly and clearly.
If you want to know the array of options of the various tools in the Tuxedo suite (and don't want to read a manual), then this course is for you.
I passed the course and had a good understanding of the material, but I suspect that the folks that did, made it through that last question in multiple random fashions.
The slides contain a lot of paper references that seem to be of high quality (that's the reason I'm giving it 2 stars and not just 1)... but the course itself is bad: it covers many algorithms, but so superficially that you learn nothing; and there are not enough programming assignments to really allow you to get any intuition on the concepts.
I would love to see this be turned into a 5-course, 30-week specialization in itself (and the professor sure looks like he has the knowledge to fill these 30 weeks)... but as a single course over 4 weeks, it's not good.
The solution checkers for the Matlab assignments were very brittle and wasted a lot of students' time.
I appreciated the concept of learning a platform in which I could conduct bioinformatics, but I feel the course did not provide adequate guidance and information.
It seemed more like a courseload for a full time student or perhaps a part-time student.
I am glad my employer paid the tuition and not me.
Would like to use the time to learn more machine learning/predictive technique, etc.
If you are at all serious about learning to program, don't limit yourself to this course, or it's pacing.
Extremely clear presentations by the researchers, but loses 2 stars for relying on assignments based on Google Docs which did not load properly and resulted in me not being able to complete the course.
Nor are the answers something that could be inferred from the lecture.
It is a pity, because it is such an interesting topic.
The material was already covered in the first course - Fundamentals of Graphic Design - and nothing new was brought to the table.
A skewed view of philosophy from an enlightenment perspective.
I had to do a LOT of self learning
What kind of things would be a good idea to include?
Excellent lectures, let down by the difficulty of the assignments.
While the tutors clearly know their stuff, I found the assignments really quite challenging and of limited educational value due to the mixture of new concepts introduced by the lectures along with new (to me) mathematics or CS that also needed to be grasped.
I'm an experienced professional programmer with the EPFL 'FP in Scala' and FRP courses under my belt, so I thought I knew what to expect but this was much more time consuming than I'd thought.
The information presented on the slides really does not summarize what she is saying at all and I constantly had to refer to the transcript to get the information I needed to write down.
The assesment questions for this course are also quite poor and a lot of the time need to be further researched online.
Really superficial overview, I suppose it's good for just familiarizing oneself with assigning the appropriate model, but to shallow for any real carry over to the real world.
I would have preferred if some qualitative and qualitative risk identification and assessment were taught, and also solve good examples of risk response methods.
The course is not for beginners and WinForm lovers.
Very rushed presentation.
I wish I could at least read the assignments if not get reviews on them in the audited version.
I also did not like the video set-up.
After completing this course I feel that I don't really know Swift, but I can use it.
A very enthusiastic teacher, but the information was difficult to follow and some of the assessments took over 4 hours to complete.
The topics are of interest however the course content could be presented better.
I wish the Chinese characters were provided for all the vocabulary and example sentences taught
Suggest removing this course as a free-standing course, or revising to allow the data/lectures to stand on their own.
Leaves out so much of basic stuff.
I spent more time on other websites and YouTube videos and in my DAW's operation manual as we were often told, "Go to your DAW and figure out how to use an XYZ."
But the price you pay for the introduction is too expensive.
The idea of having support with the videos does not work with this course.
The content was potentially interesting but the delivery was slightly below expectations, in my opinion.
But the audio quality was not so good.
I did not find this course as good as the other parts of the specialisation.
In summary, the topics were interesting however the organization and supporting materials were lacking making for an unsatisfying learning experience.
Now I'm so dissapointed.
It gives a lot of formulae without proper explanations.
Its difficult to follow.
Very general content.
It has ended but I have the feeling I still have no good idea about what is world design for video games...
Explanations were not that engaging.
I think Jadav Payeng ("the forest man of india") has done more for the environment than all the attendees at all of these environmental conferences do.
She is just reading off the slides instead of providing more examples and scenarios to help student comprehend the material.
By the end of the course, you do start to develop the "hacker mentality" the course writers want you to develop.
It is mostly theoretical; very limited examples.
In order to do the course within 4 weeks I would have had to order a Rasberry Pi before getting to these lectures.
bunch of information, but the videos are tedious
The quizzes are also useless.
In fact its good.
This seems like something that is inherent to approximation algorithms, but is only asked in the exams/project, and is not even mentioned in the lectures.
It is odd that a course that concentrates so vehemently on speech tone, as a segue to music would be taught by a monotone and mostly unenthused professor.
Many bugs, lecture content does not cover topics required to complete the assignments, assignment instructions are not written in a clear way.
interesting information but TOO many LONG lectures that were VERY repetitive.
A submission too complicate to learn chinese-Three submission is too reasonable.
: the videos stop all the time and this makes it harder to follow what the teacher is saying!
It would have been less distracting just to have the slides to read.
I wish this course had been designed and taught to the standards I have come to expect from Coursera courses.
This will be an excellent course for undergrads and high school students but not much in depth knowledge and learning strategy for higher levels of education.
Teachers show mastery on their subject matter , though their presentation style is not genuine and naturally animated, to the point that it may feel boring.
There was very little lecture material and the course felt thin - as if it were 2 weeks of material stretched over 4.
Bias towards the American healthcare system and deathly boring.
The content of the course was good.
However, I did not like the presentation of the material, moreover such a topic would need to be covered by a longer duration course.
I hope I could give 1 start but to show respect I rated it 2.
It is good but for an introduction its too long.
Bad learning experience.
There are parts that are seemingly there to pad out the lessons such as Task Runners.
It was just a torture listening to him!
I'm just not sure there is enough hand holding over the difficult bits for someone brand new to coding.
After having taking Cloud Computing Concepts Part I and 2 (which were excellent), I expected a continuation of the very deep level of technical material.
Hope you can change your approach in the future or I don't think your courses will have traction.
I'm not against that per say if it was entirely free, but charging for an advertisement is ridiculous.
Also, considering there is not video the course seems very non-interactive.
The way it is organized could be greatly improved.
I think statistics you need to take in person.
I found this course too advanced for my level of familiarity with statistics.
Maybe that's good for teenagers and Millennials, but not for me.
Mobility poses severe cyber security threat and syllabus is talking about MDM which is for compliance and cyber security.
Which online school has this policy?
This course should be revised.
Please Get A Professional Presenter [or at least competent.]
It shold be very very concise.
The project was no better.
I think a different type of real world object should be used, perhaps one that is not easily stored in a data frame.
That section did give some clear opinions on why Swift should be chosen over Objective-C for new development.
general and shallow, not very informative, could be inspirational for those haven't cooked in a long time.
The Quizzes are written in a very tricky way.
Lots of overlap in the videos, not a lot of information on C++ features, too few hands-on activities with the features taught.
I have a background in biostatistic and epidemiology but I'm still having a hard time understanding lecture.
that's not enough for proper learning.
The first interview sounds "staged".
Teaches SQL with MixedCase namings, all-named constraints and other non-standard syntax.
At times the lectures slides felt like displaying the subtitles and reading off them.
This course basically treats you like an extremely slow-learning retarded individual.
I had signed up thinking it was for native English speakers, but it was more of a English 101.
In fact, one of the most challenging assignments in this course was building a journey map, something that was mentioned in the lectures, but not gone into in depth at all.
There are a lot of different sources where you can find tutorials and such for learning a new language, and in this course the material was... good enough.
I think this course is for 4th graders.
After not being able to pass the assessment, I've fallen behind on the course and I'm too busy to catch up.
Could have been presented in a better way.
The course could be improved by cutting the repetitive materials, avoiding the time-consuming drawing on the slides and be more precise on the wording.
The course material did not cover what we needed for the weekly quizzes (particularly in Week 3 & 4) and the final exam was immensely difficult.
It is better to go through good tutorial over R base plotting system and ggplot2.
So much time is spent on how to calculate stuff by hand, without even mentioning how it translates to excel.
"Lesser" Vehicle is also considered an insult in many circles.
The male Professors seem to speak Chinese half the time, therefore not being able to understand the material for students who aren't fluent in Chinese.
OK introduction to material properties, but not rigorous (leaves out definitions, motivation and conclusions/consequences) and skips some things that come up on the quizzes.
Too much focus on databases and database operations, rather than data science.
The assignments are too difficult for a 4 week course.
Mini-project grades system is awful.
I did get some good information out of this class, but I found a disconnect between the lectures and the homework.
I am afraid this is only two stars from me for now.
There ought to be more hands-on practices, and the assessments should be more challenging towards understanding, rather than matching terms.
I had a terrible time figuring out many things simply because my DAW had another term or button name for it.
I'm glad this is over.
Aside from week 4, I found this course to be little more than a commercial for various social analytics programs.
But if you learned any language already, it is too too too easy.
Pace was slow and I was disappointed by the content level.
I found the instruction distracting.
The subjectes are not learnt deeply and precisely.
Does not give much intuition around the subject.
I've changed my exercise to mostly Pilates when my weight stabilized and I enjoy it enough to stay with it.
This applies to mathematical definitions, proofs where most steps are skipped, tree diagrams without the context of their underlying theory, or bullet points used in place of what could be detailed explanations.
All material is left equally weighted.
Moreover, 8/10 questions in the lab sessions were not related to machine learning at all, but simply looping over data and counting or similar.
So to then be graded on a purely pass or fail basis (that, looking through the forums, many students weren't even AWARE of until the first review grades rolled in) is ridiculous.
There are better courses than this for example Yale Game Theory(YouTube) explanation is not good.
Too easy and full of straw (meaning thing not needed)
(3) Week #6 is significantly more involved than previous weeks.
Really too basic for meaningful learning.
Basically i resume of economics concepts that can be taken for granted as a prerequisite of the course
I did not meet my expectations from the course
I request the authors to make the course much more simpler
I was not aware that the files are available on the server and can just be loaded by read_csv(filename.
csv).
I didn't like the quizzes, most of the questions added no value.
However, in the later part of the series the explanation and examples were very light and process of creating new models could have been detailed more
These aren't part-time tasks for a few days, these are full-time tasks for at least a full month each to do them properly from scratch.
There is no one participating or collaborating here!
Just read the ppt
You can't put that as a project on a resume, because you're doing 5% of the work with your hand held through it.
Worst of all, the code given to you does not adhere to JavaScript best practices, like local variables not being declared (so that they become global variables, a big no-no), spacing being all over the place, etc.
However, the lecture are not related to the exercises and are very hard to follow (I think it's the same thing as Brian's class in Johns Hopkins' data science course) If you are taking Bill Howe's class, just go straight to those exercises and skip lectures.
preety boring, lots of code copying.
This course will most likely be of no benefit to people not viewing or creating fine art photography.
But since I'm interested in the course i'm re-enrolling to complete it this time.
Too far from subject
btw, you have to wait till three students review you project.
If your a beginner there are way better courses out there.
The lecture videos gloss over the topics briefly, but do not give a thorough explanation of the core topics of the course.
Much blaba, lenghty lectures, but less delivery/content.
exchange rates) are really poorly explained.
If you mess up in your delivery, press the little button and start over!
but it wasn't useful that much.
For a course that requires you to work on your own project, it still forces you to follow a code skeleton outline.
So, I put a lot of effort and consideration into the reviews I gave, trying to make them helpful, constructive and encouraging.
I just would have liked to have more instruction or examples of the elements of composition hierarchy.
As a result, he fails at both.
Better than the first course of the specialization but the concepts are still explained not clearly
I didn't find the tooling aspects of this course particularly helpful, but I'm not in the target audience.
No useful info for me
Seems light on material.
nothing new in this course.
To Mr. Campbell's presentations, I would only award ONE STAR.
On the other hand I really liked the presentations from Mr. Farivar.
But if you want to PRODUCE some great work that will help you land a job in the industry, it might not be for you.
Instead, too much time spent on videos of "role playing" - just spend time giving proper examples we can learn from instead of blasting through them.
These assignments are so unrealistically hard that they demotivate.
It's like "this is a hammer", "this is a saw".
After reading other reviews of this course, and struggling to complete the FIRST programming assignment, I canceled.
With a grand title and grand introduction, I found the course very superficial and gained little additional insight form "Big History".
I much preferred Andrew Ng's course, and I strongly recommend doing that one first.
Exercises are sometimes not clear in their statement.
Content was thin and none of it felt immediately actionable - felt like more of a "hey isn't this cool" series of videos rather than something that could be used by a professional.
Sometimes you need to look at next week's course to do this week's quiz.
Gives you the ability to distiguish problem solving methods, so you may use them as required.
Nonetheless, mostly wasted my time watching this.
And no, I'm not new to programming.
I again found many of the lectures to be difficult to follow along, there seems to be lots of different styles of videos in the way that the person was superimposed on the slides.
I am giving it a 2 and am leaving the course because several of the recordings in the second quiz don't work.
However, text has numerous spelling mistakes and there is no involvement by academic staff.
Great content but making the theory of ape or chimp the origin of humans as the corner of the course and intruduce it as a truth is very wrong and shameful.
This is a great course if you have literally no idea what the 'Internet of Things' is, and if you find using a smartphone challenging.
Looking at Wharton, U. Michigan, Yale courses (just to mention a few) and then looking at the majority of European offerings, the gap is very salient.
Submitting my homework and then seeing that other people did vastly different stuff made me question my own submission (Did we just take it in a different direction or did I (or they) misunderstand the assignment?)
He found them to be of exceptional health.
Undertanding a nation (including thir constitution) has to involve looking at both hum-drum normality as well as uniqueness.
The course should be called Web Resources About IoT.
In addition, there were a lot of glitches with the grading software.
The discussion forum does not work as intended.
Felt difficult in understanding the overall course in short duration .
The autograder would never tell you why you were wrong, just "I'm sorry, your solution didn't pass all of our test cases."
The Peer Reviews brought my overall grade lower because I didn't get the High Mark I should have.
The model of having students watch a video of a person talking about coding, whether in front of a Power Point slide or a text editor full of code, is borrowing from the worst of the "lecture-first" classroom experience of (most of) higher ed.
It could be vastly improved by doing away with the peer assignment review requirement.
The apps you build are incredibly basic, and there's no real discussion of how to generalize from them.3) Is the course presented in an engaging way?
Because of this I would only recommend this course if you already have an intermediate level in Python.
some swirl tests (4,5) don't work because of parameter method in qplot function.
expected so much more!
Too much contents in short lectures.
I've lost weight with a lower calorie diet and exercise, so, yes, it can work, but it is very difficult.
On other Berklee / Coursera classes, this hasn't been nearly as much of a problem.
I had some issues with this course which is why I rated it a 2.
First off, let me start by saying this is a very good overview of what the Cybersecurity Terms are, but I wish it went deeper into the subject.1.
Try again" Week 4 of this course, which contains a vast amount of information has no exercises at all.
Overall, this class is the polar opposite of a quality online course like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course.
I think Dr. Peng needs to improve his teaching skills.1.
In the end, it does teach you the basics of R, its just too bad that the way to get there is aggravating.
The reason I still only give it 2 stars is because of the quality of the courses itself.
Missing and incorrect spreadsheets for assignments and no response from TAs for days at a time.
The course content is spread out over three weeks as follows...
Week 1 they go over setting up a Ruby on Rails development environment, which was fine.
Instructors saw no value in presenting elements of course that would help learners complete the assignments; rather you are sent off to teach yourself about uncovered techniques needed to complete the assignments.
Unnecessary video segment at the start of each lecture is annoying and a total waste of time.
For those with English as a second language be aware this course uses grammatical terminology but in a stylistic way and can cause a lot of confusion.
Bad teaching quality.
Sorry.
If there had been a working autograder for the last final project this course would have been worth it somehow.
What does that mean?- The lectures provided valuable information.- The quizzes generally made sense (in relation to the lectures).- Learning how to code wasn't really possible.
Why is that?- There is only one programming assignment.- The autograder doesn't give any feedback at all why resp.
The lecturer is very good.
The content is probably better than my perception - and I'm perceiving high!
For a course with the name "Pro Tool Basics", I was expecting some specific knowledge about this particular software but what the course really teaches is basic music production things (samples, synthesizers, how to create tracks, how to record audio, compressors, EQs, etc).
As I am already a music producer using Logic Pro, I was hoping to learn more about the software itself and its differences in comparison with other DAWs in the market, so I was a little bit disappointed in the end!
pages of assignment for the 3d week?
It may have made sense when this class was done 3 years ago.
However, the quizzes and tests seemed to be of a very different level, and often covered material that was hardly discussed in the lectures.
And Professor Daphne is an agile and therefore less disciplined speaker which lessens the understandability of her speech in conjunction with the poor sound quality furthermore.
Took me 44 hours of pure coding time (according to WakaTime) to finish the course.
Quite poor.
Review of documentation from meteorjs website.
Slow and boring course.
Last assignment is where something starts to be moving but that's the end of course :(You could dive deep into Subscribe/Publish, what is below meteor(node.
js) etc.
Since this was he was presenting the main overview of Buddhist content it was particularly disappointing that his presentations were so bad.
I understand that there were difficulties in getting the course up and running from the various delays in its starting date and the change to its title and perhaps Dr Germano's role was more affected than the other lecturers.
It would be like a fashion designer mis pronouncing tulle as tull-ee or bias as bye-ez.
Just not impressed.
I believe that this course should be stopped until these problems are corrected.
Kind of childish.
I had a very hard time staying with this course due to my frustration with instructor style of communicating.
There is no mention of 68% anywhere.
Videos often go silent for several seconds for no apparent reason.
The assignments are repetitive and you are pretty much spoon fed everything.
too easy for cs major.
Another, smaller beef I have with the presentation of the course is that when he had students who were raised under different religions come up and speak their beliefs, it took a long time to demonstrate a fairly simple idea -- despite people ascribing to the same "label," the same religion, they can have in fact been taught very different things.
The course material was quite boring.
Add to that the fact that Brian skips from slide to slide very quickly often not providing adequate explanations and you'll be re-watching the videos many times over.
Several of the videos have blatant errors in them, like the fast that the fourth video of a week also contains the entire third video... again.
Such things should not have passed a half decent QA test.
More than anything this specialization should not be marketed as "no previous experience needed".
Of all the offerings in the specialization, this one felt like it was thrown together in less than hour.
I would recommend the coursera online training session need more improvement.
The Course could have been covered in a more interesting way
A real disappointment.
I also think that Coursera knows this, because this was the first course where they ramped up the e-mail encouragement campaign.
Felt the class needed more hands on learning.
The discussion boards were empty and the reliance on peer reviewed papers left a little to be desired.
I am glad I did not choose to pay for the certificate.
The assignments say they require 3 hours, but I would venture to say that most students have spent way more than 3 hours on the assignments just in researching solutions let alone debugging supplied software along with their portion of the assignment.
Extremenly vague questions prone to misinterpretation.
Most of the time is not spent on analysing data or coding but trying to understand the autograder and questions.
Could be improved but at least it kept me writing.
Not the worst, but I did not think this was a well developed course.
The algorithms presented in this course are interesting.
Swirl package contents were better than the lectures in the videos.
The professor give excellent information interspersed with interesting case studies.
I am wondering since this is an Executive program, is there a simpler and easy to grasp way to present the material.
For a while, that's the worst course of scala specialization.
I see obvious negligence in preparation of many lectures (especially bad week three).
The target audience for the course is professional biologist that are comparable with arithmetic and elementary algebra and can easily use an internet browser.
The course contains numerous mistakes: in particular, the elementary formula Dr. Cecilia Lasser presented in her week 4 lecture on Differential Ultracentrifugation contains an error.
The lectures presented by non-native English speakers are very difficult to understand because of poor & inconsistent English.
Please, make the lecture slide available for your students.
Please, arrange a forum giving a possibility to ask a questions and get understanding of the material that remains unclear.
The lectures on electron microscopy were very good, - thank you, Johanna!The lectures on AFM was the only one that was just excellent, - Thank you, Dr. Shivani Sharma.
Please, review the sequence of lectures: I think the week 5 material may be moved to week 3.
google, stack overflow... etc...
They change instructors for difference topics and obviously some instructors are not very good at explaining other than reading the material.
The videos skipped many medium steps that are actually very crucial for understanding the concepts.
What I find shocking is that there were so few questions with few multiple choice answer that you could easily brute-force these quizzes if you really wanted to.
Talks more about the professional settings where conversations are going to take place and not about helping student with their professional English speaking skills.
But for the later part of swirl, it's confusing sometimes.
Very little take away from a practical perspective.
While the course-work and the presentations itsself were excellent, the "homework" was a real pain as very often the Auto-grader didn't work and it took me hours to get a project which was correct, to be accepted as the right solution.
The flow itself was more like "food for thought" where a bunch of ideas are presented as sort of an intellectual gymnastics exercise with no point really.
The quizzes are about the course structure and not product management.
I only took it because I'm plannening to finish the specialization.
I've taken several Online Courses (5+ on Excel), and this is the worst and most frustating one by far!
The specialization was announced to be on an intermediate level but at the same time, you need to spend money on a very basic course with swirl assignments pretty much copying the course content.
I wouldn't complete the course if it wasn't a part of the specialization that I am attending.
The material is very interesting, but with only 15 minutes of video a week, it is really not enough.
As another reviewer has remarked, their English may be quite sufficient for day to day use with other experts but for inadequate for teaching students who are hearing many technical terms for the first time.
It's difficult to follow the content.
This is a very good introduction but, atleast you could provide some optional projects or some tasks.
It was very hard to see what notes were being hit by the mallets (especially when using chords) and therefore it was very difficult to understand (visually) what Gary was doing.
I had already worked with Foundation.
Actually a great class on a topic that is highly relevant in theory and practice alike.
Chaotic and full of irrelevant (IMO) information.
Quizzes are long and redundant and there isn't enough recognition of the relationship between climate change and thermodynamics.
The videos were helpful, but too fast.
I direct him to read Richard Dawkins on this subject.
However, I did not like the fact that you get limited to learn how to use a paid and (very!)
Would be nice if maybe for the capstone only, some sort of professional or professor weighed in on your project for some legitimate and helpful critique.
The studiant do himself the teacher.
This certainly soured my experience with the course.
This information is available for free online on the websites of the respective software.
I understand that such an introduction is needed for the course, but then do not offer it as a separate 20 pound module.
This is like going to watch a (very slow) concert, and then having the guitarist hand you their instrument, put your fingers on the correct frets, and then strum the strings for you.
I feel like I learned a lot.
I expected better feedback.
I found this course to be fascinating from the lecture point of view, but "abusive" in terms of quiz expectations.
First, while the beginning segments about how we know the Presocratics was great, the presentation of the early Milesians was shallow and did not deepen my understanding of their world and thought.
Reference this chapter in this book for more detail."
Instructors or TAs are not available in discussion forums.
I've taken more than 5 coursera classes, and this has been my least satisfying.
The result for me was that, although he chose not to go deep, the principles weren't as clear, memorable or relevant as I think they could have been.
I did learn a few useful things of course, but it was a disappointment in general.
I understand the advantage of being able to "learn from others" but it doesn't outweigh the disadvantage of not being able to work at one's own pace .
Working code needs to be fitted to the way its excepted to be.
This course contains quite some useful information, but overall it seems way too simple.
give a try to module 2 and will see.
very borring and too simple
Often verbose, but never succinct, I had to listen to his drone twice to glean anything of value.
His tests were wrought with "gotcha" questions, having nothing to do with the important material of the course.
The videos are hard to follow, the examples are few and far in between, some explanations (eg.
Videos were boring and the instructor was invisible just reading off the slides.
I would give up on the beginning but commitment is top of all.
The content from this course is already out of date for Meteor.
js and links are broken.
If the peer review requirement did not exist, it would easily have warranted a 5/5 rating.
Videos kept cutting out either entirely or the sound would cut out.
Near zero interaction from staff, short videos leave a lot to be desired, and worst of all, there seems to be a problem getting everyone's assignments peer reviewed (which makes no sense).
There is a somewhat comical thread wherein staff direct students to contact coursera directly via a "contact us" link on a page, but get this, the link isn't there.
I'm having a hard time seeing the relevance.
There was some mention of this in Germano's material but he did it from the Tibetan point of view.
To read it all includes sometimes +1000 pages for one week (not going to happen).
I think the course covers pretty good range of topics and gives you a good information.
The assignments in this course take much more time than indicated.
the speech is too fast to be catch up with and doesn't have much useful contents
The content is good but is too focus in the 3 act structure, and don't explain the narration techniques specifically to videogames genres.
They serve more as a review if you know the subject, otherwise I don't think most people will get much from them.
The audio isn't very good for most of the lectures, many having an very annoying chirping sound (from when you leave an old flip phone near a computer... "teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-tehhhhhh....".
The first 2 assignments, a high concept document and a story bible were doable.
But a full GDD and a prototype on week 3 and 4?
Very good course material.
All in all, there's just a lot of wasted time.
When signing up for this course I was really excited for the entire specialization - now, not so much.
The course resources comprise of videos and notes.
For me this is too artificial.
I'm sure the information included is very informative, but it references information that was included in other courses.
Now there was like three quiz questions per topic.
Too one dimensional in terms of presentation and no opportunity to interact with tutors.
For example, I don't think the images on the background (even if they are stunning) are particularly important and I think they could be substituted by plots and schemes referring to the topics (all the presented schemes where helpful, but there would have been more things that would have been good to see visually).
no mouse to highlight on slide when teachingIt's a lot of unclear parts in slideI think cs231 is better
way too many peer reviewed assignments.
There is an assumption that we as students know what the teachers are talking about.
The course should have been more thorough and should have been accompanies with good programming exercises as well..
At some starting course there was also some cross talk among the instructors.
That is a serious and very salient gap, that I think you should reflect on.
For instance, every video starts with "welcome back... this is why people like this... [meat of the video]... this is what we just talked about.... see you next time".
Also, the lack of responsiveness to issues raised on the forum and issue-reporting buttons was a disappointment.
After having briefly discussed the Agile Manifesto, which emphasizes things like "People over processes," what is the first thing that they dive into?
Could not understand many of the mathematical formulae involved.
Since I already speak English, this isn't very useful.
No challenge at all, no meaningful example, and in the end seems that everybody grade without any reason.
Content not discussed in proper detail.
I ended up just reading the introduction, glancing through the texts and searching for the answers for the quiz.
This course totally miss the purpose and potential of MOOCs and the great Coursera platform.
I was attracted to this course because it offered the science behind Buddhism and I am studying neuro-science.
She was just reading off a screen and not actually teaching.
There's not much substance.
The issue is that the Peer Reviews were bad.
Quickly steps over lots of material, some of it is out of order.
I found this course adequate if it was free, but not worth $79 for the amount of resources I was given to practice what we learned.
The assignments are poorly thought out, overly rigid for requiring very specific methods and mediums, and the peer review system is kind of a joke.
There is a dearth of video content.
If you are considering taking this course, be forewarned that the majority of the support of problems/issues come from the community, not the Professor or Coursera.
I am not sure peer review is eventually working in this course.
The instructions seem outdated and not relevant to the actual tool, there are lots of different sets that make it even more confusing and even after getting round a lot of the technical difficulties, the tool doesn't seem to be very useful... :( I feel like I wasted a lot of time trying to get this to work, with no results so far.
Maybe a question about why states/schools have different approaches or how outcomes differ between states/schools, but memorizing a laundry list of which state or school has which policies and practices is useless and did not advance the learning objectives in any way.
This course needs alot more examples, especially where the statistical tools come into play.
I enjoyed the interviews with people discussing their work or history.
Furthermore, the presentation style of the professor is not engaging, nor does he address interesting archetypes or examples in his lectures.
The early lectures were profoundly dense, monotone and cluttered with non-contextual detail while being (strangely given the subject) seemingly empty of a real desire to share, or convey, understanding.
Just a very slight notion of the subject.
The class isn't over but I'm suffering through it, not enjoying it, like I did the dino Uof A classes.
I would appreciate if they were double checked before release.
Will not buy rest of specialization, feels like this is just a cash cow for UCSD.
I find far too theoretical, too dry; no examples, no exercise guidelines.
The Coursera platform is garbage.
Overall, I recommend waiting for a better course.
All apologies to the professor for any harshness, and I MAY try again one day, but not now.
I had to put in more than 10 hours a week to complete this course.
Lots of editing problems, and blurring on the text (gave me a headache several times).
Some good points.
Not particularly engaging.
I dropped the course after the second week because of this.
I tried asking about this in a discussion forum, but got no answer.
the course is theoretical, it would be better with more examples and case studies.
I'm a statistician, not a programmer.
Of course I'm not used to the mathematical english terms.
Many mistakes in the slides and poorly defined problems in the assignments have gone uncorrected for over a year.
I think maybe this is one of the classes that doesn't work well in this format.
Makes the certification worthless.
Prof.
The instructor was good, course content is good, but the lack of a suitable support representative for such complex subjects pulls down the reputation of this course.
I hate to write a negative review when the designers of the course have clearly put a lot of love and attention to detail into making it.
This course is not meant to stand alone as a single course, rather is a portion of a larger Agile Development course.
Additionally, the method of assignment sharing is a file upload/download dropbox.
In addition the quiz answers would not match up to what was learned in the video.
Good overview of all the services, but I could have read it just from the service list, and all the labs can be done without watching this course.
However, the way in which the lessons are organised I'd say is confusing.
One of the worst courses I have taken on Coursera.
I didnt learn anything about data science.
This course is very short.
It seems like the course loses its focus about on-half of the way through.
The style class, the plot class and the setting class all had detailed, concrete teachings, whereas these lectures were too airy.
This course SEEMS to be a great course.
Unfortunately, relational algebra is explained quite well, but not really applied after that.
Too basic and not thorough enough.
He jumps through parts that could have otherwise given valuable information and experience like creating the deck class.
Dropped the whole specialization halfway through this class.
Their data must tell them this is where people fall off the specialization.
The peer review assignment part is reallyuseless.
The overall quality of the course is good, but in my opinion the level is quite low and there is less content then I expected.
it can be adding videos with more length and in-depth that in a easy way the ten domain about cybersecurity.
The first course of the specialization is very simple.
I am sorry, but this is true.
The course coordinators didn't respond or help in the forums, The topic area deserves more in depth video lectures and discussion.
The course was interesting, but I would have appreciated more academically rigorous assessments.
Videos came through blurry despite using "high quality" settings.
Imagine you want to learn to play the piano (and you play a little guitar now) and you go to the piano class.
I signed up to learn how to write good code, but I don't feel like I learned much.
It might be useful for some (especially those in B2C or willing to play around with the tech), but it was a waste of time for me.
Sometimes it is fun to decipher the mystic equations.
It's a very introductory class, only works for newbies of digital marketing.
Maybe it's a good start point.
RD Peng's courses take a much better approach in that they keep things at one end of the spectrum (simple language).
In-video questions would have helped more.
Update: As I proceed to wk 5, I know why there are some complaint on Dynamic programming,Reduced to 2 stars.
Furthermore, the professor is difficult to understand a lot of the time.
The visuals are the best part of the course.
Without the ability to do the assignments and receive peer feedback, it seems pointless to continue the class.
seems this module does not follow the principles of the earlier 4 with regards to virtual teaching
Perhaps if I eventually get it, I will re-visit this course as the tutorials are thorough.
So, create assignment like that learner learn less thing but accurately.
The course is great but beginners but not for intermediate and advance learners.
This course tries to cover the many aspects around the games industry.
it should be possible to learn the material only by reading.
Having a BSc in Economics, the Linear Regression tutorials and quizzes seemed infantile, while the Binary Classification tutorials proved to be too vague, when we actually had to apply this knowledge on the final project.
I wish there were guest interviews of more experienced academicians than what happened here as interviews from which there was little to learn.
The class was also strangely designed and executed: the amount of content per week varied significantly; the vast majority of the content was in a very specific energy sector (biofuels) and other key sectors were almost entirely overlooked; it also seems like the content is already a few years old.
For me, that's a waste of time.
You could deducts this information though.
And a lot of searching through bioconductor forums.
I liked the relevance of quiz questions to real life genomic questions, but all quiz questions were outstandingly difficult, because of both lack of examples in lectures and errors in some packages inside bioconductor.
Overall I expected much more from this course and I cannot recommend it to anyone.
I won't get extra marks for being able to work THAT out!
How about an example from the real world, like even an e-commerce application?
the stuff about GPCRs is so far removed from importance when discussing addiction).
He is very animated and a good presenter but, even when I understood what he was saying, I couldn't get past the "why is he doing this?"
There isn't much in terms of substantive learning here.
It probably could have been inserted in various segments of a larger data science specialization throughout the classes.
Last, some of the questions contained ambiguities that could not be reasonably clarified even going back and reviewing the material of the specific segment.
It would be helpful to have this course more geared towards college academic writing and have more emphasis on developing ideas, finding resources to support ideas, synthesizing, paraphrasing and all the other skills useful for college academic writing.
I assume most people who come to Coursera are above high school level.
I thought the instructor was very well organized, and knowledgeable.
Hopefully these will be finished my next session
This class was so boring I could not stand it.
The instructor seems to take a midway between rigorous mathematics, using terms like robust etc while at the same time also trying to keep it easily accessible.
Some of the class material is posted on YouTube and has advertising.
Do you mean a variable which lets you decide order of filters and executes the filters accordingly or does the ability to manually rearranging the order of the calling of functions in the code suffice?
The jupyter platform is also very frustrating.
They don't really add to important information that we need to remember.
I feel like I'm spending hours and hours but learning nothing.
It's just that execution could've been a lot better.
It was overall a good course for a beginner but too much theoretical things are there, one needs to push more on practicals.
Not coherent, many unrelated topics with little explanation of their importance and real-world use cases.
I paid money for this course and the quality of it is notably worse than most free MOOCs I have taken.
I can't even review classmates, as they're uploading .
rar or .
zip-files, which can't be accessed via iPad, and also javascript is a problem for ipads.
The desciption is really confuse and most of the time is spend trying to chase small differences away to please the grader.
The sole part of the course that seemed interesting was the shuffling one, that was unfourtunately ignored on the assignmentsNot related to the course but to spark: What utter mess are dataframes and datasets filled with boilerplate type conversions and runtime erros.
What a waste of time!Secondly, the transcripts are in rich text, which is basically unreadable, has no line breaks, which makes reading the poems impossible, and the transcripts are poorly transcribed, making them illiterate.
I feel I may not continue with the course for these reasons, even though the content is really interesting.
This is the worst presented MOOC I have encountered.....
I have completed 6, and am undertaking another 2, with edxcel and with futurelearn
Besides learning the language, you'll learn about holidays, foods, and art, and you'll hear Chinese music.
Unfortunately, I could not give the course a good rating because I found some quiz questions impossible to complete.
The assignments in Week 3 and Week 4 in particular were either vague or had errors that nobody double checked and course-takers had to use trial and error approach to get answers right.
If a student makes a mistake, no feedback is given other than, "That is not the right answer".
Also, instructor support / feedback to student questions was lacking.
The teacher can explain more and not just read through the slides.
I took the HCI course in 2014 that was precursor to this certificate program and it had a better flow and more organized.
Did not find the subject interesting but the course did give useful insights into the industry.
The discussion forums were the best part of this class.
I prefer the female Professor from Advanced Neurobiology I who presented the material in English, and in an engaging and coherent way.
I liked the practice with Python.
Its also reducing the total amount of knowledge that is being disseminated.
The lectures got a bit disorganized towards the end, like the professor was in a rush and then forgot to relate everything to actual business analysis.
This course is extremely basic.
Articles we read were interesting and the assignments were engaging.
In a live university class, having students speak can work because the evidence is being presented by "one of you" ("you" being the students), and has the added benefit of building community in the class.
The tests are also not well made.
(Perhaps if Coursera had lecturers present in front of small groups, as "Great Courses" does?
The informations were useful, but the videos were repetitive.
The instructions were unclear and the exercise seemed futile.
i think the coming classes will be great more than that ... but it's good
This course is a mess.
Quiz was not well structured and title suggested a different idea than what the course was really about.
All other ISB modules are far better on Course ERA, except this one.
Although this course holds quite a lot of information, it is quite slow in the way the information is transmitted and unfortunately, the presenter did not 'made homework' in terms of preparing what to say.
I am honestly not a fan of Amy's teaching style.
This is the rating for the whole specialization.1) Some course are nice and well done, but probably only 2-3 of the 9 (The entrepreneur one is really well done).
Once I posted to the forum and no one answered so I never asked about the other questions I found during the videos.
I think it the course goes extremely fast, I do not agree with its tittle of basic nor the instructors provide sufficient information to achieve the final quiz goal, I am not sure about completing the entire course.
Neither Excel nor the analysis part.
Some lectures were quite interesting but the generel course level is very low.
Very disappointed with the course...
Too prescriptive and prone to lists.
Also, there is way too much repeating
I would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for 3D printing, with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lion's share of the course.
Taught very quickly and assumes a high degree of math fluency.
Aside from that, I was unable to find much value.
Course staff do not respond to this issue... Not very motivating...
The grading criteria is also flawed.
Please look into it.
I would like to receive the certificate, I am willing to pay for it.
customer is not a part of the scrum team).
Preparing of a part of an university course by a bachelor of computer science....
The course really isn't that useful for day to day management decision making.
Same story.
In addition, you are required to grade the assignments of your fellow students.
it would be helpful to provide some hints for each assignment.
The title of the course is misleading.
Having Colleen talk at the camera for 5-12 minutes per video got tedious really quick.
I suspect that this course is being used to provide data for furthering his own research.
It's not as if there aren't plenty of academics and practitioners who are active in this field.-it's confusing to describe Tibetan Lesser Vehicle practices but then illustrate them with Pali text sources, modern Mindfulness practice, and modern Brahma Vihara practice all of which have emerged from the modern Theravadin tradition.-it's also perplexing to include information about many modern Theravadin teachers (Sayadaw, Goenka) in a course apparently not about them.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the videos about Sayadaw and the interview with Sharon Saltzberg, but I am left in the dark about just what differences, if any, there are between them and Tibetan meditation.
Overall I think this course was offered prematurely.
The videos alone do not give consistent background to approach seriously the quizzes.
// If the swirl() functions were made the centerpiece of the course, and the videos were described as just a narrated glossary, at least our expectations would be in line with reality.
I'm not suggesting its not doable for the complete beginner, but the time commitment may be prohibitive.
To then be asked to peer review others based on this is particularly disengaging.
What I need is the professor to explain the logic behind the formulas, the *why* behind what is written, instead of just reading *what* is written on the slides.
I find it amusing that with an expected learning of 8 hours a week, the total duration of the first week's videos add up to a mere 36 minutes.
This course is poorly organized and presented in comparison to other MOOCs offered by Wharton.
Course content is quite interesting, but it is a real pity that the english is so bad.
The entire courses was focused on statistics, yet the final project was focused on R. I wish I had prior R knowledge before starting this course, yet on the front page it says it's a beginner specialization.
The course was too short and did not provide any reading material.
It would be more helpful to have more and shorter quizzes.
A lot of talking, I missed some practical tasks / projects to be lead through to practise the subject
The slides have several mistakes and typos, which makes you doubt the whole course.
Dijkstra's algorithm isn't that difficult to implement from scratch, and yet all that was asked of us was to implement a small 10 line for-loop.
My background is in software development, so I know a thing or two about writing code.
Tests and quizzes also could benefit a lot with a revise-currently plenty of confusion with phrases and wording.
Especially for someone who is attempting this course having experienced two excellent previous courses in the specialization.
The speaker is almost entirely reading from the Powerpoint presentation you're being shown - they could have let you download that and you wouldn't have missed out on anything, really.
In 2 of the 4 assignments 2 of the 3 people gave me max grades and 1 gave me bad grades, and did not left any feedback!
This course should not be presented by video.
As a starter for a Java course I am worried.
I had done ALL the tasks in February-March - I don't remember exactly when, but I received my certificate in May.
If you have any marketing and/or messaging experience you will most likely be bored by the course.- For a course that focuses on engagement, very little mixed media use.-Timing issues of informational slides (usually too short.
I would've saved a lot of time by knowing the R commands used in this course.
I was expecting more deep on tableau usage.
Realistically I would not recommend this course if you don't have a STEM Bachelor's degree and you will likely find it painful if you have been away from your degree more than three years.
Let's just put it this way: Mastering Data Analysis (mostly things to do with probability) with occasional use of Excel.
Too basic.
Some calc and formulas are not clear otherwise the course allowed to have a general overview on financial instruments and trades
Numerous answers are just factually wrong.
It's just because I personally don't like the instructor and the way he talks, which could ruin the course!
Reason for this is that there are questions being asked, which weren't even touched in the lesson.
It's basically the same with the last assignment - you can watch and do all the lessons before, you've got no idea how to start and what to do as there's simply no explanation of what affects what - which seems to be extremely important in javascript.
The assignments in this course are reasonably good but the instruction videos can definitely benefit from some additional in-depth material.
I will have to buy the book she keeps averting I guess... after spending quite good money on the course already.
Tasks are impossible for those who are not happy.
Requiring a file in order to complete an assignment strips away my liberty in doing so.
They are HARD.
One last thing: Wearing white shirt and using white marker makes it impossible to read what he writes.
I expect the projects and Peer Graded to be a litle difficult.
I learned some new things, but overall I don't think that I got understanding of base concepts.
This course is *NOT* for beginners.
I've completed it in about 4 hours.
I'll stick around until I get too bored.
It was good only in few patches but the link was seriously missing.
I suppose I wanted a faster-paced course without a lot of hand-holding.
Even though the course discusses relevant topics, the level is extremely low: The lab sessions were easily solved applying copy-paste code from the provided notebooks, with minor adaptions.
Course doesn't do nearly enough to bring you up to speed on using mathlab or iPython notebook.
)- subject mastering (the "teacher" seems to be lost sometimes and admits not being able to explain some parts of the course, which may confuse and demotivate learners not knowing exactly what they are being teached and how it works.
Moreover, in the courses covering database subject, security issues are involved.
It would be better if there were more tables like that.
Also, more information and help is needed on how to accomplish multitasking.
I get lost a bit too often.
The teacher sometimes explains easy concepts and omits the difficult ones (e.
g.
Very basic, I hoped for a more advanced level.
I was lost for a while.
The weeks 3 and 4 are going to fast and the things that are teached are not connectes with each other well.
Like the teachers OK, but they all went through too much material way too fast and without proper explanation.
However, this course fails on a few crucial levels.
The Power Point downloads are excellent and are to the point.
The material is well managed and organized but I am not able to really hear or understand.
It distracts from the slides and seeing him move doesn't help understand anything betterConcepts like VIF or hat values are not very well explained by the teacher, at least the SWIRL lesson explains it correctly.
There were too many comparisons to Harry Potter and various three and five act formulas.
In the quizzes, every answer choice was correct and there wasn't any possible way to discern.
Because I find the first course in this series very interesting (the assignments are challenging and easy to understand; the professor does a very good job in explaining the materials), I continue to take the second course, which is this one, a shoot.
Personally i couldn't define happines and couldn't remember anyone who i am grateful to
The other type of videos are lecture-style things that appear to have literally been sliced out of some other more thorough set of videos - sometimes the professor refers back to "earlier" parts of the lecture that we haven't actually seen before.
The quizzes and peer assessments are poorly worded and confusing.
Quizes are inconsistent with given dataset.
The approach in this course is incorrect, I think that will be a course with more concret examples, but is a course with a lot of teory that is not applied.
I don't know if it's the pain of switching to the new platform or what, but the total lack of any support from the TA/instructor team is frustrating.
Standard filler course for an empty education system.
Extremely highlevel, quality of the material is significantly lower than in the previous courses.
---------- way too much time is devoted to introducing definitions and way too little time is given for student practicing and review .
I hardly learnt anything from this video.
Interesting content, but sooo slow.
For a project-centered course, I would expect feedback on the project (your resume) to be important.
A better course that covers the same topic in more detail is: Writing Winning Resumes and Cover Letters.
The videos are slow and unengaging and way too much text on each slide.
Again, it would have been helpful to have seen some concrete examples, as I've never heard of that document before.
Requirements and processes are important, but people and communications are the backbone of any successful software project.
I'm dropping this specialization and searching for another course that really follows Agile methodologies.
THE COURSE LACKS SUBSTANCE AND THE QUALITY OF A DANISH CENTER FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
I am sure that UAVs engineers don't spend their hours in this kind of crappy search.
my knowledge was actually worsened, not improved by thus course.
tiresome to watch two supposedly very intelligent instructors amuse themselves by saying Bro and Dude.
Lessons are very good but the Assignments for the later weeks are way too hard for people with no math or programming experience.
I liked that the content within the main lecture was concise - it really needed to be because the lecturer has very little variety to his tone of speech - listening requires "high cognitive load".
Examples of this include engineering, molecular biology, chemistry, work in a lab in general etc.
I had to force myself to finish this course which rather defeated my goal of learning for fun.
After a disappointing course one, I will not be taking the additional four.
You have to study them on your own.
I hope this course can be more systematic in terms of the structure on the concepts and lecturers.
I do not like how the lecturer teaches.
Especially since part 1 of the specialization was so good.
Student interaction is one of the strongest aspect of MOOCs.
Given that I was expecting the technical depth of CCC parts 1 and 2, I already had much of the knowledge that was presented and could figure out what the instructor was trying to present, but I felt bad for someone who wasn't already familiar with the material.
Most of this course felt inconsequential, unhelpful, and not worth the money.
Not very deep and not always structured, but rather focused on the technology principles instead of the data principles.
I think that this specialisation suffers the same problem most data science/mining/analytics courses suffer: it ignores the non-technical starting point: scientific or business relevance.
This course -- actually, both the 2nd and 3rd courses in this specialization -- are like "take your interested, but mostly uninformed friend to work day".
Evidence based research/ practice will corroborate it.
This course expects you to have a lot more ground for an intermediate course.
In the end I would rather be an uninformed lover of music than make myself crazy trying to learn it with people that are taking an introduction class and clearly forgot what it was like to be in your first couple of months of learning music.
The material is pretty weak.
I expected it to be teach in a better way, with more lectures, PPT presentations...
there ought to be a better way of explanation.
This course makes a valiant effort to provide as much coverage of Bayesian statistical methods as the prior three courses in the "Statistics in R" specialization do for Frequentist statistical methods, but the lack of supporting material (e.
g.
This would have made them feel more worthwhile and that someone else was actually reading them.
The lectures for this course lacked substance.
I am taking this course as a requirement for the Data Science Specialization.
could offer and cover much more subjects.
spend too much time on basics, less on advanced.
could have chosen better music examples.
Not as detailed or practical as I hoped for.
While the code that is pasted is explained, and a lot of content is covered as a result of not having to write it, I feel my overall retention is much lower than in other courses.
The course fails to clearly explain how to use so many of the formulas that the professor just glides over in class.
Thank you.
I can't say I really enjoyed this 5 week course.
The course material was useful however greatly disappointed with the organisation.
There is not much of a relation between what the course gives (explains with the videos and with the SWIRL exercises) and the real exercices they ask to.
The only solution was to put the answers in a document on a cloud drive like Google Drive and paste a link in.
The course covers the basic foundations of behavioral finance, especially prospect theory and various cognitive biases that negatively influence our decision making in financial affairs.
The topics covered are definitely very interesting and the lecturers frequently prove that they know what they are talking about and explain some topics in adequate depth and breadth.
For a valuable Coursera course I am expecting that most of the material is covered with video lectures (otherwise I read a book on that matter) and I am expecting thought-through slides with clear definitions, clear practical examples and exercises, and the presentation of experimental proofs for the given statements.
Regrettably, most of this course is comprised of simple slides with limited structuring, as definitions, exercises, and proofs are often intermingled.
(BTW, Pandas documentation is also dreadful, as of this writing.)
There are no excuses.
About plotting in R. Not about generating real insights from EDA.
This "planning" course was slightly better than the preceding "landscape" course, but it was still underwhelming.
very basic, tool based solutions, no real content behind.
Usually these courses are about learning and being mentally challenged not getting a toolbox.
Too repetitive.
Defiantly the worse MOOC I have taken.
Projects and Assignments are quite useful, and I can expect to use skills I acquired in my day to day work.
There's a lot of "minutia" detail in the lectures that never seems to have any relevance because there's no practical application discussed.
I think all the concepts could be introduced in half of the time.
Disappointed after taking a previous course which was wonderful...
student conversations and dialogue from around the world.
I have truly hit a brick wall and can go no further...
One of the perfect MOOC is Calculus One by Jim Fowler
No way!
Mostly disappointing.
The instructors were never present in the forums to answer questions.
The course is very abstract.
This resulted in lots of time wasted with the grader.
One of the quizzes has the answer included right beneath the question as a typo!
Also looking at the big picture, there is a tremendous gap in quality and approach to online courses between EU institutions and US top tier institutions (favoring the US offerings).
Additionally, the materials do not prepare you for the review, and on weeks 2 and 3 (the hardest) you don't have a chance to review the questions or correct your mistakes.
During the week, questions in the forums were answered within a day or so, but there was no help at all on the weekends.
But, as I said, most of this is directed towards to someone in a management position.
Arguably the worst of the bunch as far as learning anything.
I will review this course appointing its pros and cons.
Pros:- The instructor: he is a captivating person.
The delivery of the lectures needs a lot of work, with distracting, erratic pauses between words, and the sound frequently cutting out mid-word as they switch between slides.
So Basic and only useful for common knowledge not something for a specialization
Basically just a product demo and the lecturer was very hard to comprehend.
Too philosophical.
The course developers should have taken the time to develop a case study for each topic, like in the first module in this spec.
Having ridiculously obvious answers in multiple choice is an insult and I now think I've wasted my time doing this course as your accreditation will mean nothing to business in the future if you are just giving accreditation away so easily.
Even a monkey that didn't watch the video could answer them (sometimes I try to do the same and it works.
About extra options we did not talk at all.
Additionally, after all these easy lectures and quizzes we were left with the final assignment that was super-hard.
is it probability of waiting ten minutes for the bus?
Not very motivating way of talking about the topic.
I mean, for a beginning writer, its helpful to just make a list of details about a character - where they're from, what they like or don't like, what sort of flaws they might have and so on.
Research and prototyping is arguably one of the most important things for a burgeoning UX designer to learn, and this class could stand to be a lot more in depth.
He lacks the practical examples to explain the principles more efficiently.
Confusing assignment instructions were frustrating.
A little disappointed in this course, it would have been better suited for the first part to a larger course other than a week long introduction to th subject.
Give me a transcript or make it an audio file.
Hard to get any significant discussions going.
And contrary to expectations for an offering from Tel Aviv U., most Israelis would likely be offended by some of its assertions/omissions.
The content can be used for introducing and familiarizing with clinical practice with ASD.
Needs better explanation of how to use other resources.
I personally appreciate a lot of the thorough proving steps introduced in the lectures, however I personally think the proofs are often not well explained to the audience (I also understand that it's more difficult to explain proving steps).
In fact, there really isn't much here in the way of science at all.
The cooking videos are fun with some good recipes.
Good information, but not good for people lacking background knowledge.
I would enclose the full content of this course into a week as part of the second course.
15 min) that got into some detail.
Also, there was no interaction at all in the forums.
I would like more tasks to help learn, it's also really really easy to guess your way to the right answer.
The labs are not up to date and several things do not work as they should.
This is a challenging course because there is a marked gap between the video lectures and the weekly assignments.
In the end one of the students flagged the video as "inappropriate" to wake the UPenn organization up.
Content beyond my fellow confused peers, and 2 minute videos illustrating various ways of saying "Write Something Interesting and if it isn't Interesting, people won't care."
Topics I learned in another course were presented here in such I way I actually got confused.
The contents are too broad without real focused depth, and too much time spent on background info in almost all lectures.
Some video lectures and writings are so unnecessarily verbose they cloud what is being taught.
The course is not interactive enough, it's a waterfall of dry information.
It is unfortunate that (as I understand it) Coursera doesn't offer a "free look" with the option to transfer one's fee to another course if unhappy.
2 stars as I did actually learn something despite the quality of the material and its delivery.
Not too much practical exercices
Finally, the start date was delayed and there is no clear visibility on when the other modules are started.
The creators were too lazy to actually film themselves, instead most videos are just text on a screen with music.
It's like it gives you part of the information and then drops off.
Poor Quality
I thought she was a nice Teacher but Didn't teach the Basics steps into speaking & learning chinese .
If she had started with ABC alphabet how to write & speak the first week then taught to sound each letter out in different pitches of volume 2week then to sentences building 3rd week so on .
it would had been much more helpful I believe ...
I sad that i had to leave the course b/c it seem and look like a great obertonty ... but it went to fast didn't cover what i Expected it would.. :(
Instructor not as good.
The exercises can be too challenging for the first category, sometimes boring for the second and absolutely superfluous for the third.
The presenters appear to approach the subject half-heartedly, and focus their energies on disproving the possibility without sufficiently examining it.
b) A lot of the review questions focus on remembering facts rather than on understanding the causes and effects.
Cannot recommend it to be honest unless they improve their systems.
Coursera keeps changing my rating.
I found that the course 'Fundamentals of Graphic Design' did an exponentially better job of explaining image making techniques and composition.
Was very difficult to follow.
The Subtitles were bad not in sync with the words of the professor and were wrong in many cases.
Delivery of lecture and Visuals of the lecture was Ok.
Module 4& 5 were very confusing and not interestingThank You Professor for your time and effort
Even if I had done so, though, it wouldn't have made up for the vague instructions in the quizzes and assignment of the final week that made feel at a loss, until I asked for help in the forums.
If different ways of saying same things do not have any difference in meaning, nor emphasis on different things, it definitely should be mentioned too as it is also very valuable information.
This course has lots of potential and the structure was good, but due to lack of good written material i can't recommend this to any of my friends :/
Everything has been split up.
I would be fine with that, as the challenge of writing correct html5 is a good challenge.
Sound is too quiet
I found this course to be dry.
The lectures are presented in a reasonable way, but this is a somewhat technical course, for wich additional materials would need to be mandatory.
Here are my complaints:-Much of the more interesting bits say "check out this other course in bioinformatics for details".
Furthermore, much of the referenced material should be made accessible within the course rather than simply cited; it looks fascinating but from places like China, databases and websites with such relevant sources are often wholly inaccessible.
there was no need to watch videos.
In a class presumably allowing beginningeres/greenhorns to participate, this is irresponsible and flawed teaching.
The same goes of the "hints" that are periodically posted (though again, appreciated!)
I could have learned how to install all those tools by myself
But it gives me a "sloppy" impression!!!
Content is actually very good, I can feel the content creator and staffs emphasis on real world problems.
The quality of the testing code is even worse.
At this point, I am disappointed that I decided to just watch the videos but skip the peer-reviewed essays and make the most of what I paid for.
The grading guidelines for the project see all specific to one type of publishing.2.
This class needs more content, more explanation.
Materials and topics were good, but the course lacks in two things.
Might be useful for total newbies, but this was very simple for me.
I'm really disappointed that I didn't get to take anything away from this class.
So, please this is my request in the future make assignments in a way that the Learner less thing but efficiently and accurately.
chaotic organization, unclear instructions, and confusing due dates; I would not recommend such specialization
Unnecessary course for this kind of specialization...
I believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice.
The best part of the course was that it made me seek out other writers about Parmenides.
In this and a couple of other courses, the video lectures jump around and begin in the middle of the lecture.
The homework and the lectures are at totally different level.
Disappointed in this course.
I'm sorry, but this is just ridiculous.
Especially since the assignment boils down to "break convention with no examples of successful scripts in this fashion."
It came of as very subjective, unscientific and I could not take it seriously.
I would award 4.5 STARS to Mr. Farivar.
The homeworks of this course are simply checking for a very basic understanding of the topics.
But many of the websites are bad organized, difficult to read/navigate or simply outdated.
The assignment asks for FIVE filters but there is no matching criterion in the review criteria.
apart from that teaching is really good.
hope you guys work on it to fix it.
The level of the participants is quite mixed, most feedback they give is useless ("good").
The long section on crowdsourcing seemed very unrelated/unnecessary.
But week 3 and 4 go in a wrong direction.
The form of lecturing is not using the benefits that an online platform offers.
The information is probably great, but the instructor speaks way too slowly in the videos and it's very difficult to listen to.
Or me -I'll do it for free.
But the material is not presented very clearly.
Programming tasks are not even in the same ballpark as Ng's.
I learned some new terms and enjoyed some new Poetry.
I was able to figure out workable code for most problems but I feel like I am still lacking the basic fundamentals underlying the solutions to these assignments and would have a hard time reproducing solutions to similar problems.
I passed the exam by writing an HTML document that was syntactically and semantically correct, but I don't know why it was more correct than what I've been doing on my own and cannot be sure I'll will write better code in the future as a result.
This course is a re-hash of both the excellent "Functional Programming Principles in Scala" and the mediocre "Principles of Reactive Programming in Scala".
You can passed the quiz by just reading online or have basic project management experience.
This left many students writing dramas rather than comedies at a loss, since they were planning for hour long pilots.
There just one part of a module (aprox.
If you record vocals and real instruments and want to learn how to do this so everything sounds fantastic, this isn't the course for you.
This course is very bad.
not as good as the others and way too quick
Please improve the state of this class from beta to release.
I recommend the course for who don't know the basis of the narrative structure, but not for people like me who work in the audiovisual world.
too much speciific details that make the course difficult to understanding.
(0 STAR)I will give a little credit to swirl, a practical tool provided by this course to learn R by yourself thought the instruction of the R program itself.
Globalization has happened yesterday... Today it's time to open new horizons in relation to application of IT solutions to management problems.
Please consider reformat the homework; make it more doable for new learners in this field.
I did not feel that I learned as much in this course as in the previous courses of the series.
The instruction might be OK, but I lost interest beginning of week 2 seeing how he build binary decision model in excel.
Requires a lot of work.
Presently this costs $ 80.
Conclusion: it is an interesting course, but at $ 80 provides no value.
Audit the course instead.
Just PID in MATLAB and not very well explained.
8 hour waiting period after 3 tries is a pain in the arse.
Maybe this was too beginner focused for me, but I'm not sure I learned anything really useful here.
Wish that there would be more insight in social entrepreneurial opportunitiesDifficult to find a group and have a platform for discussion.
it's good but can be better they have to give more examples about the concept
That is taking into consideration that I would not rather call any other course (of those I have taken) “a bad one”.
Referring cases studies is good as well.
However, the material seems simplified and is very much a basic course and not intermediate or advanced course.
Additionally, the quizzes are very simple and have ample room to increase the difficulty level in order to make the course more challenging.
Video's were great but some of the assignments were unpractical and the tests were based on minuscule details.
I feel there should be a more obvious indication of the difficulty.
I would have rated the course 4-5 star based on that.
I think the course is great - I would give it 5 stars.
This is absolutely NOT for beginners.
Positive: you provide written/text versions of your videos.
Perhaps it is designed for those who are more analytical than myself..
For example, there are questions about "approximation ratio", but it is not explained.
While the subject matter was extremely relevant, I didn't think this course was taught well.
The teacher seems unprepared in his lectures, he stutters and repeats a lot and makes a weird noise between slides.
Not as good as the other courses.
also it only contains round about a 100 minutes which is not that much.
The other two stars came off because of how tedious the peer-review assignments are and how little they add to the understanding of the content (it is not hard to understand, so the assignment ends up just being busy work).
As with so many Coursera MOOC's, little involvement by fellow students in discussion fora.
Right when the class begins to introduce a more robust tour of laying out a game story, it suddenly ends.
Not happy with the quality of the material.
Will be faster.
Barely any depth
Poor performance of Jupyter and the wildly underestimated time commitments really sunk this one for me.
Compared to other Python Courses I have taken this is course has no meat on them bones and is NOT worth $80 at all even for a certificate.
It should be stretched trough more then 3 week for example 6 weeks with less lecturers with assignments that are graduly get difficult.
and a general lack of an in-depth motivation for the principles.
I think the first two courses in the series are too basic and should be combined.
I think in attempt to be enthusiastic the instructors frittered away my attention.
I forced myself to keep going for two weeks/modules before I decided to buy a good book and take a more specific course like the one about Real-Time Systems
I found it very basic.
Do note that if you were to take this course, you need time because the assignments are time consuming and the videos are (I think) a little longer than they really need to be.
I did not find this helpful for a complete beginner.
And why must the videos show the teacher?
I appreciate this course and the instructor's time, but so far I haven't really learned anything.
The structure of every lesson is:"1.
The course is an introduction to the absolute basics of python.
However, could cover the usage of the terminal and Rstudio better.
It is a shame as the platform is nicely designed and the course topics are very interesting.
I am very dissatisfied with how there was absolutely no outside help/feedback from instructors or mentors in the forums when clearly the final project was outside the scope of the material presented.
The 3 word feedback comments I got from all reviewers did not feel like worthy responses to the amount of time I put into this project.
Also, the quizzes are excessively challeging taking into consideration that the only resource availble to students are the videos.
Too high level.
More time seems to be needed focusing on the basics of chemistry and chemistry math (such as how to read CH4, sig figs, etc) prior to testing on stoichiometry.
The first 2 weeks have too many videos, which make it difficult to follow.
I feel like the course was recorded a few years ago, and not much done after that to fix flaws, even though they are probably well known.
Totally waste of your time by watching a bunch of videos.
Informative but not challenging enough.
With much more axamples.
Besides the videos only showed the formulas with no example at all!
This whole thing is being handled like a college course and that is crazy.
On other occasions, the question actually specifies to use the model from (3), whereas it actually wants you to use the model from (4) instead to get the correct answer.
The course content was somewhat scattered and lacked focus.
There is a disconnect between what is taught and what is assigned.
Keep in mind if you do this course, you had better be comfortable with calculus, linear algebra, vector math/mechanics and it would be helpful to have a head start in Matlab.
Certain unexplained suffixes in equations and worse, changes in the suffixes without indication that they changed or what they are.
Feels rushed and it's hard to learn for a beginner.
If you cannot afford to participate you have limited access to the testing material.
Good MOOC if you're just starting out and looking for basic guidance on where to start.
Errors in the material made it difficult to get through.
I liked the course because of its format and material.
I didn't take JavaScript class in the past and it was all new for me.
The students with very basic level of English have to study with advanced non-native speakers and with natives.
1 week is about running a project, 2 weeks are about using Tableau, and the final 2 weeks are about presentation.
Really?!?
The Global Diplomacy course should provide clearer and deeper about diplomacy than to pose what is diplomacy or what the diplomats do in their very actions of daily routines.
And by some, I mean do the whole thing on Khan Academy first.
Assignments are very difficult and definitely not for R beginners.
Too basic, this should just be a read
Which necessitates actual, meaningful content.
The video lectures were not on par with the, in my opinion, extremely demanding programming assignments.
Positive aspects:Readings were relevant and interesting.
I learned a lot.
I was challenged.
Negative aspects:Programming assignments took SIGNIFICANTLY longer than suggested (I have 20+ years of programming experience and am fluent in 3 programming languages, but I'm new to Python).
Course did not provide enough support to learners.
Not well prepared and not well explained.
Furthermore, there was a problem with the practice exercises... You need to download an app to do the practice, which I did several times, but the lessons or assignments never worked.
Could have been better.
Good contents but a bit over-complicated assignments.
Some profs are very good, some are terrible.
I can't give more for this course 2/5
You don't really learn what you need from lectures.
Many examples were suggested, but I think it would be better if there were more international brands rather than Spanish brands.
I understand and accept that self-study is very import to master things nowadays, but I really think gap is too big between what was taught in class and what you need to complete this course, especially for people that has zero data science programming experience like me.
I'd rather spend time watching 2 more hours of teaching videos per week that can cover more aspects/topics/tips/tricks than go over lots of docs and posts.
What is a " backlink" ??
It is a bit of a pitty that the instructor speaks too rapid ( it is ment to be also for non-native US speakers?).
Short of content and engagement
Ok, my decision heuristic in such cases is "Use the hammer not the tweezers!".
Overall this course does have some good content and delivers big data concepts.
I understand it was a more practical course but still more information would have been great.
"Sit think about this, go learn about that".
Not really about Product Management, but about Project Management
I am sorry to say this, but the tutorial could have been organzied in a much more serious way.
I do not know how much time the Professors have put on preparation.
Spends a lot of time on self-advertisement.
I felt absolutely crushed trying to learn and understand all this.
Not only were you unable to assess your comprehension of the material because of this, but also it meant receiving annoying emails and notifications that I had not completed the module.
But no, the “design” means “project”.
recipe are at the end of course.
Yet doesn't provide a lot of concrete answers that helpful to solve x.
This has not been a class where I learned much.
Thank you
I know this could be a good exercise but I would hope it at least provide some useful resources.
Generally, I am very disappointed.
When trying to fumble my way through the code, I found, on several occasions, the code in the self-directed lessons to be incomplete (I'm referring to pieces of code that were obviously meant to be there, but were missing), causing hours and hours of anguish and turmoil.
The emails are often confusing and some assignements require you to do something each day for seven days in a row, but don't really warn you about that anywhere.
Many of the problem sets ask you to apply theorems in ways that have not been demonstrated.
I completed a Certificate with Berklee online and I do not recommend this course - but I do recommend Berklee Online courses, with written lessons and interactive works!P.
s.
UC Davies and Coursera should provide this course free of charge or with a voluntary "donation"
The course description says that there is material for 4-8 hours, however the videos are only one hour long.
I feel that it was done blindly and in a rushed way.
If you want to know WHAT computational investing is, you can take this class.
Nice course but the peer assignment is awful.
Use more simple examples, draw a big picture in our minds on what is this course all about, what are we going to achieve, in each of the topics, what are we going to look at and what methods available.
For foundation class like this, I think few simple examples and introducing one or two useful methods in each topic would be more than sufficient to us.
It took a lot of time for me to capture what the video taught.
was boring.
Responsive web design is about creating different interfaces for different device form factors.
Very lengthy
There is no help forum or feedback from instructors
It was helpful but too technical for non-business person to learn about basic project management.
?
In this way it has two much load for person who works.
However this is no assistance when by TAs if you have questions, which is important since there is no feedback on assignments and hard to know where you went wrong.
Don’t just try to cover the materials so you think you have done the teaching, try to understand how your students learn and make sure they really get it.4.
I've taken free courses on here than involve 1000 word essays and then at least you're forced to process the information in the lectures.
I was confident that I could learn while taking the course, but I continually failed to pass the quizzes in the second of five courses.
First, it's not well-organized.
I do wish another instructor could have done the videos.
I highly recommend reviewing and improving the content.
My expectations were that the lectures would be more in depth about the science behind the tools available, why you would use such tools, and when to use such tools.
Therefore the Nearest Neighbor homework assignment from the student's perspective does not have much to do with neural network other than using the results from ImageNet 2012, which was not explained in any detail anyway).
the video lectures were difficult to comprehend.
Will be more better if there are case studies in the quiz and we answer questions applying the knowledge from the video lectures to the case studies.
A very poor course.
Good course, but outdated.
The assignments have several problems with the given code.
I wish it was a blend of lectures and practice.
The other component of this class was learning how to create documents that you could use to pitch your game to developers.
good course
The students ultimately figured it out by spending several laborious hours figuring out the peculiarities of the solution checkers, and by helping each other.
Tiny lectures and no readings from professional books
Learners have been complaining on the forums for months about bugs and missing information in the assessments, and they are still not fixed.
The logical progression of how to approach different problems - and the terminology of the statements involved has been thrown out the window...
If you're new to statistics, I suggest you should at least double the time allocation they provided...
Poor presentation throughout the course.
But the coverage in each of the subject is not deep enough to be useful.
But this may be usual for business classes.
Some interesting commands and are shown, but the instructor seems to be tired of explaining them and defers explanations to lots of links at the end of each video.
All the lectures are not clearly explained and a fresh person cannot understand few things and even in the assignments not mentioned properly what has to be done and if not how to solve them and how can you imagine the learner knows all the terms related to web or the particular language..?
Neglible science, neglible evidence - just stuff I already knew from non-scientific Buddhist sources.
Very discouraging.
If you have them, you don't need to take this course.
It can be good for students who have never had an interview.
Maybe I was expecting so much, but the material is really to simple.
that's what you said !
Generally the assignments lacked nuance and complexity as well.
Much of the evidence in his lectures is delivered as an anecdote, which might appeal to some (e.
g.
Lectures are a bit hard to follow, not because of the complexity of the topic, but because of some controversial and outdated data, and the speaking and presentation style of the lecturer.
Assignments contain too many trivial questions, but also some mistakes which makes some questions impossible to answer correctly, based on the lectures, or at all.
No staff engagement or feedback on the forums, which is especially problematic regarding to aforementioned mistakes.
The title and description of the course don't inform students that it is completely US-centric, and mostly concentrating on petroleum/oil.
The quality is dramatically better.
The videos ramble too much which makes it hard to really dig into the material.
A couple of weeks ago I have just finished a course that subjectively is comparable in its difficulty level.
I have yet to have ANY of my essays reviewed, although I have finished every requirement of the course.
For example, there was no instruction on how to read error messages in Python.
although I've finished the course but it wasn't as good as i thought.
Includes line of code impossible to understand in earlier videos (e.
g.
)Instructor consistently mispronounced words that are CENTRAL to the field, which just seemed weird and made me question his credibility.
The lectures are still useful, and would recommend doing this as a free course, but see no use in paying for a certificate on completion of the course.
The only positive was it enforced a schedule and structure for me to try my hand at Bootstrap.
This is a very unevenly paced and constructed course - not at all delivered to the standard of the previous Coursera courses I have followed.
The assignments need a lot of improvements.
It gives us a structured view of the stages of game design and its documentation, but I think it would be better if it was like a case study.- The assignments: probably the worst part of the course.
Super difficult.
The course content is perfect, however the rating system is kind of disappointing.
I found this course lacking in providing sufficient coverage of the basics in the course videos and lacking a useful and directed reading list.
I can learn and so much more and gain valuable experience, just by googling and youtube videos.
Please, try to focus more on programming instead of being cool and fun.
It's hard to adapt to the idiosyncrasies and lecturing style of a new person in a four minute video, at which point you get a whole new lecturer and have to start the process over again.
A maximum of two or three lecturers for the entirety of the course (perhaps with the occasional guest speaker) would be helpful.
Could have utilized video lectures more.
The format of the course is not very engaging.
I had really high expectations from the course, I believe but it wasn't upto the mark.
I have mixed feelings about this course.
Module about codecs was great.
The rest was too easy.
Very theoretical and mathematical and not enough real examples.
The assignments are well thought out and explain the algorithms step-by-step.
I believe the instructor is very smart and experienced in this area, so this is definitely a course that could grow into a Coursera essential.
I do not know where I fail but I failed all the questions.
Compared with other ML courses on cousera, this one makes me feel that it is more like a handbook/dictionary instead of a tutorial to teach students.
Not very challenging.
Also assignments' instruction are a little difficult to understand.
I didn't find this course particularly helpful or useful.
This course covers challenging technical topics and I appreciate that the effort that went into making it.
I'm trying a new course on graphic design now...
Really basic, with some interesting stuff but could be reduced to a third of the time...
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment
The accent,presentation & stuttering is too cloudy & not suitable for foreigners
It has a value in generating a general awareness about ASD.
I simply don't see how this can relate with the business world as a consistent comparison.
a bit too simple to be a paid course
Instructor quality is low, production quality of instructor videos is low.
But - too many ("demanding"?)
Not enough information on how to approach the final project.
Again, I believe that evaluations should be challeging, but these quizzes are a bit esoteric, they lack objectivity.
Nonetheless, it is important to say thank you for being present in this platform and having the will to put it together.
Having all the material in well formatted written format, i could been able to easily skip the parts i already know.
In one type, the professor is in a lab or kitchen or classroom or something and is physically demonstrating things.
Really bad.
Where did you obtain this information??
I did learn useful tools for web analytics, but I wish the instructor put some of his original insights rather than presenting articles written from other people.
I followed one Python course at Rice University which was by far better given.
The materials explaining the course are too poor.
I suggest using a keyboard and having the camera shooting from the above of the keyboard (look at how several people have done this on YouTube).
This class was actually about responsive web design, NOT information design.
The lectures for this course do not adequately prepare students for the graded quizzes and assignments.
Good course....
but way out of my depth!
I had to resort to checking through forums for the correct questions.
), and two, the examples are UNINSPIRING.
The quiz is missing key links and the questions read as if they were written by someone who's first language is not English.
The assignments were questionable and the examples used in the first assignment at least no longer exist.
By terrible coincidence, my computer blew up.
I was often unsure of how much I would need to know about such concepts.
In terms of communication ability, the presenters don't hold up against many of the free/low-cost services I'm accustomed to using, for example: MIT OpenCourseWare, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy, Code School, Treehouse, etc.
Its because speaker talks fast, unclean and with bad sound quality.
Very good course for basic physics.
For example the required length of the essay does not seem to be obligatory.
The staff rarely bothers with answers in the discussion forumAll in all it is an interesting topic, and a good starting point for your own research.
All it went through was some basic though I would have expected to go in details esp.
It was an interesting first experience with Python but it seemed a little bit to easy for me actually.
Even the instructions to export the csv file were misleading at best.
More stuff like that, possibly also with an electrical diagram etc and som flow analogy.
If I can propose anything it would be to organize it a bit more like Michigan Universitys Python learning series.
Very very introductory.
The professor's presence is resolving these issues was practically nonexistent.
I will find another way to learn Ruby.
I didn't find this module very helpful and some of the assignments were truly confusing.
Please do not advertise this as for beginners - I think people who have had some programming experience before would find this great, but not for the newbie.
The subject matter is good, but the course does not adequately explain behavioral finance concepts.
I would not recommend this course as an introduction course unless you've had significant experience with Python data structures and know how to work with lists, dataframes, and iterate over those.
Suggested for individuals who have never had any exposure to information on conflict or humanities
Gave up after Week 6, so I cannot comment on the whole course.
The capstone topic was not very interesting.
You never know what is wrong with your code.
None of this is bad, although the material would have benefitted by being spread out by perhaps two more weeks as realistically people who have been in the workplace a long time may need more time, and have less time per week with family commitments.
The quizzes often asked for information that was never presented in the lessons.
dunno wwhat's the point of making two separate courses with different names.. the content are fundamentally the same.
1 out of the 2 stars I give belongs solely to them and the fantastic work they do.
I don't feel like I've learned much or that the exercises reflected what was being taught in the lectures.
What I liked: Materials have quality and a professional approach.
I knew R and was looking for an intro to Python.
I listened to the first Module and then part of the second module.
I paid to get a certificate and did achieve good marks on the tests and assignments up to week 4 if memory serves.
It would have been better if after each module all the .
js and .
html files would be given in total, not just the snippets.
With an otherwise high quality program, I recommend re-producing the inference and regression lectures to increase the overall value of the curriculum.
Feedback in assignment is not good enough.
For example, for the points and segment, there are no correct answer in output as a reference.
What works for some might not work for others and unfortunately his style did not suit my learning requirements.
My rating is purely based on the content which I think can be simplified by giving more visual examples.
It was assumed we knew the basics of characterization, but most students did not!some of the other students frustration and confusion came out in the peer review, which was a bad sign.
This isn't a beginners course.
I must admit I did not read the extra material provided with the course (the long articles) but only focused on the videos, slides and tests, perhaps had I read the articles I would have struggled less.
I still intend to do them, but now I passed the course with a 100% mark but only 10% of knowledge.
Is this entire course going to be watching videos of powerpoint slideshows, wrapped in a rather buggy website?
The flash tutorials are helpful.
Add to that frequent issues with the notebook crashing and much of this coursework was an exercise in unnecessary frustration rather than increasing enlightenment.
Questions on final exam did not seem to relate to materials covered in course.
Working on the capstone project is practically optional.
Not all adults are into coloring; this is not elementary school and what's the point of coloring a picture of the Arch for you?
The quizzes are not set up correctly and you get marked wrong when you put in the correct answers.
I took every note I could and reviewed again and again.
The week 4 lesson content was a bit dense for an introductory course.
The course does not offer very useful material.
Very general information with too much dependance on the textbook for the course.
However, the content was simply too much for me to complete.
I am currently learning to program python and a lot of this stuff was well above my head.
The quizzes and assignments do very little to reinforce the work, and often come down to trial and error.
Taking this course is like getting lost across a ton of different websites!
A lot more diagrams could have been illustrated for explanations.
There are other mistakes within the quizzes as well, which make them near impossible to pass.
This could probably be compressed into a single week of setup for the R Programming course.
There are very little material each week, and then you get a quiz, which is not the best form of examination nor for learning.
I bought the book on the basis of being interested in the topic but it is not at all necessary for the course.
Sorry to say that, but this course has nothing related to programming.
Assignments for week 3 and 4 were very tough and a little guidance was provided on how to do the coding part.
i can't see the course teacher so it look like the all parts of course are the same
I tried hard to learn in the course but lost track by the end of week 3 and the peer assignment.
Furthermore, the additional readings need to be culled significantly, it looks like someone just googled BI topics and then copy and pasted the links they found.
Leaves the student feeling somewhat forgotten, which is a shame considering the brilliant material being presented.
I would recommend the content of the course 'for fun' but if anyone is looking for an accurate assessment of material learned, try another course.
For example the project "book".
That's very bad behavior in programming.- At the end working code that meets the teached rules is marked as wrong.
Not bad for who have never met the SEO
I've been able to work on the course at relatively fast pace and have now completed all of the lectures, readings, quizzes and test but can't go on to the next course because not enough people have submitted the homework for me to grade.
First, the rating is very subjective, thus I might pay great efforts to my submission but get a grade below my expectation.
One of the main presenters, who led about half of this course, would greatly benefit from an editor to help them organize their ideas.
And the design of the tests and assignment is just awful.
I suggest to fix the problems because it is hard to understand the content of the course if the problems reamin.
The teacher just ask questions in order to stimulate students, but doesn't teach anything.
Everything was either super basic or else more advanced but so niche that it doesn't really apply to everyone and we don't need to learn it in that depth.
There has to be extra lectures included to guide the project.
If one is taking a machine learning course, one can expect more from the students.
Course is gathering general information on smartphones, and tells an historical view of smartphones et OS associated.
what could help professionnally is more about how to develop apps on these phones, today and tomorrow.
Interesting course material, but there were way too many mistakes in the exercise files.
the content is good but no what was expeceted, as it said interfacing I thought it was more about sensors and gpio programming
Of course, if you aren't registered for that other course, you don't have access to those materials.-Not a lot of thought went into the homeworks.
There could have been more instruction given on how to grade.
It confused me a lot as i wasn't sure why one would say it in one way and other in some other way.
I give 5 star for the teacher, really approach having such a well-organized teaching material.
I also give -1 star for the homework assignment and its (almost) GraphLab only approach.
But I don't know how
Perhaps animal foods are not as unhealthy as the course suggests, and food (and soil) quality is paramount.
Instead of taking this course, watch Maya Adam's TEDx talk (https://www.
youtube.
com/watch?v=5-gyIkA-crM) and browse the recommendations of the Weston A.
If you are interested in iOS programming take the University of California, Irvine versions of this class.
This is just a poor sample of a course.
I can access to some contents: videos and lectures, but I can not send quizzes or assignments and to get feedback without paying a fee for this course, very limited!
Besides that, I like the theory about parallel and concurent programming, and all the stuff about "iron".
"the pie") and less so on learning actual negotiation techniques.
This whole course had the amount of informations as one week of many others.
You can do this quite easily in XLS or SPSS in most cases.
only a small portion was applicable to my country and school environment
I also found it absurd that each time the professor introduced a very basic linear algebra concept he kept saying somewhat patronizingly "this is for the experts in linear algebra".
The content was redundant at times, at other the dots that were trying to be connected were to wide apart on the spectrum
Much trouble with freezing and no sound
I think more focus should be put on including more number of real world examples and solving them within the videos.
Also, the concept of three Professors for one course was hard to digest, which led to the whole course feeling discontinuous and disconnected at several instances.
how do you think about developing a plan, not looking for a step by step instruction set)?It's disappointing that the only way for someone new to data science, R, etc.
This is the only course in Coursera that really got me disappointed.
This is photography... where is the photography from learners (other than the assignments)?
It would have been more helpful to outline the types of behaviors that make an individual fall into a specific category socially and how to change what your currently do to enhance your social likability.
A very beginner level course aimed at starters who dont have much experience with Data.
The lectures prior to this will not prepare you for the assignment though, so might as well just skip them and do it on your own.
For a beginner, it is a fair start but definitely many things could have been better.
Also, the way the course content is extremely segmented into short videos, with 20 sec intros to each video, is extremely distracting and interrupted my concentration.
It is best to have a strong statistical background before taking this course.
Too easy.
An mix of general tips on how to write well mixed with some corporate-specific information.
I've also taken Wharton's Intro to Marketing course which I highly suggest over this course.
Why use n-1 for standard deviation?
Most of the time the questions are poorly worded and thoughtless, and the whole thing reminds me of a bad high school class.
The professor is so slow I have to have him at 1.5x speed when listening to his lecture and am still falling asleep.
Poor quality overall.
The other presenters were great, as usual, and presented their topics in a clear, concise manner.
For complete beginners it should start with a module about Foundations of Programming and after explain in depth what is a method, a property, an event, a calculation, a variable, an object, etc.... After I finished all the modules of this course, always coding along the lectures and having done all the assignments to practice and having read the extra material, by the end of this course I didn't had a solid foundation about how to program in JavaScript.
very basic information from high-school STEM classes
I would be mad if I try to finish this course on time.
If you're not watching, you miss the questions.
Would anyone really pay money for this?
This will be helpful for any later reference.
These videos are 5-10 minutes long each.
There seems to be multiple right answers.
Was expecting a deeper unsdersting and knowledge of child nutrition and its impact in the health of little ones... too general.
However, the main problem I encountered was with the video lectures themselves, particularly during the 3rd and 4th week of the course.
It is clear that she is reading from a screen while she is looking into the camera.
The instructor is obviously reading directly from a script because of her constant long pauses between words and how frequently she gets lost when presenting information.
This course was clearly not ready.
26 WORDS.
Instructor reads lectures in monotonic voice.
I did a little course work where I programmed some simple console applications like talking about my name and favorite games, but then he drones on for hours and hours about concepts without actually putting them to practice.
Having done some other machine learning MOOCS , this course seemed rather basic to me and did not enjoy too much using non open-source software for the programming assignments.
The instructor speaks very fast and you need to continually stop the video to keep the pace.
Discussions in this course are voiceless and dead and the instructor never appears in discussions.
Tricky quiz questions.
I find it too politically charged as it emphasized the "visual diversity" (religion, ethnicity) over the "second-order diversity" (diversity of professional profiles and personalities) which should be the focus of a management course.
based on impressions after module 1:-quality of lectures: just dry material from books.
Or the question.
It is too small and shallow.
a little propagandist, but interesting with that in mind
In my opinion, more detailed exercises (with a guide for solving them) would help to understand better the concepts behind the theory.
She is very encouraging, and easy to understand.
The final assignment is peer graded, which means you'll have to deal with idiots grading your final assignment.
Loved the graphics though.
Most of the course is providing useless statistics, i didn't enjoy it and it's a really basic course.
Poor video lessons.
This especially true for the LCA part, which I don't even think is a difficult concept to grasp.
I think the best courses I have seen online is not particularly rehearsed and it is usually just a guy, with a pen, running you through some examples to illustrate the working principles.
In my honest opinion, the quality of this course is not that high.
The specialization is designed to help you get a job (see capstone) yet the software currently in place is limiting.
I felt we reached a low point when the only way to pass the assignments was to figure out what the instructor did wrong in the assignments, recreate those problems in my files, and then answer the questions "correctly" with the incorrect data.
Poorly made very short videos that do not explain the subject matter, some of the content is outdated.
A clear guide to course prerequisites and the Rasberry Pi and Sensehat must be provided.
Neither of the tutors seem very happy about their job.
Then I will come back.
and then a few assignments designing a few characters .
I was disappointed with this one.
the Course content is great and the Tutor is doing a great job but I didn't like the fact that i'm forced to use Github to submit my assignments
I'll say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization, if you have the skills to complete this course then you don't need to take this course.
The Swirl package was much better at "showing one," "doing one."
Theoretically good course, could have been made more interesting by including more examples or cae studies.
Sadly this course was one I abandoned - I lost patience with its random and frustrating structure and the limiting and perplexing nature of the quizzes.
The course itself is fine.
Very basic.
I found the assignment quite difficult as I felt that what we were asked to do was not possible.
Vague content, quiz and programming assignments not exactly related to video lecture content.
The instructor is good but the amount of content is severely lacking compared to alternatives.
If you say someone values something at $20, you don't have to say - that means he will let it go if offered $21 and will not let it go if offered only $19.
The material itself is relatively academic and the trajectory topic was definitely so.
Some questions in the quiz are not helpful for learning more about the topic.
More than that, many of the suggested solutions were bad coding (like collapsing 50% of the data before training, or writing sixteen special cases rather than a general function) or pointless (like training a linear classifier on pixel data).
There are better courses out there.
Lecturer is too boring and volume is too low.
I feel like there should be a lot more time spent on the actual coding and learning how to implement it within the code (similar to the 1st course), rather than spending an exuberant amount of time going through derivations and no time on actual coding and how to implement it within the programming language.
If you are a software designer/engineer or programmer, then you should be fine as long as you pay attention to the very long lessons and derivations and can fix the broken code that you are given.
This course is very difficult for beginners.
Quite disappointed in this part of the specialization as the other sections had in depth presentations, clear information, lots of examples and great slides.
Lastly, the assignments were rather interesting early on but once again quality decreased as the course progressed.
However I found the lectures were too dry and theoretical as they lacked real life examples.
I was unable to complete the following exercises after gulp installation failed.
Especially week 2.
Even if you are able to talk everything above the sky and up to the moon.
Assignments are very inaccurate.
Paints a very distinct picture, a picture with an agenda and really incomplete portrayal of addiction.
Good lecture and content.
this student was inundated with formulas that needed to be practiced - and i didn't even have time to write them down !
Reason why I rated it 3 stars (only) is that the course was too easy - however I'm a sustainability professional.
I respect Pro.
What I found somewhat because being this a series of courses in marketing, a lot of these issues had to been fixed/addressed before the course started...
Nonetheless my critics - which I expect to be considered as constructive critics, it is important to thank IE and Coursera for continuing providing online courses.
I wish you luck.
Ricardo J. Oliveira
It feels like it's more focused on financial measurements and probability, it hasn't related to my line of work yet.
Half the course is installing Rstudio and signing up for github.
The topic was interesting , but most of the questions need to be rewritten.
[For your reference, I have a PhD in Mathematics, taught for several years at a highly selective undergraduate college, and have extensive experience in industry as a Matlab and SAS user.]
If you love to learn a lot about something, I don't think this course is for you.
It has been a delightful course as a refresher and putting more up-to-date examples than when I covered much of this material some time ago.
For instance, I was sometimes confused by the vocabulary or the variable notations which are not always clear.
In the other two courses (Quantitative Modeling and Accounting Analytics) the excels were explained and available for download.
There is no discussion forum.
This course is good for those people who has never program in Python.
You have no idea why the element is empty as the students are given a different dataset to the one tested on.
A data analyst would be focused on improving the business and doing the analyses that pertain to improving certain aspects of a business, not finding his manager's earnings management using an M-score etc.
I figured the way to solve it, but I hove no idea why it is solved that way.
Unfortunetly I see a trend - the other course of the managerial economics specialization also is very short.
good, but need to pay to attend test
Could have included a video that explains few commonly used pipelines and ask the participants to do a project based on it.
I'm not sure who the target audience is for this course.
I took the noncredit option and this was the first course I've taken at Coursera (including Duke) that did not allow me to get answers to quizzes I wanted to take (so I stopped taking them and feel I learned less).
The modules had a lot of aspects and covered each one in detail.
Important basics for people starting their Project Management endeavour.
I think it's due to the charging policy of this lecture.
A solid overview of accounting and finance for the non-financial professional.
The course doesn't feel complete, the information and techniques used for assignments can be found completely online through documentation and instead this is merely an exercise for doing basic analysis through documentation rather than an explanation of python through data science (which is what I anticipated)
Even you finished all tasks, you need to wait for receiving your grade.
The video is ok, but it lacks a lot of details in calculation.
How to actually do level design, what makes a good level, etc.
I had to move "ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'test'" from rails_helper.
rb to spec_helper.
rb to get stuff working.
Without my ruby on rails hubby, I'd have been lost!
It's more statistics than Excel itself, wich is good but I think the name doesn't fit to it
I would say needs deeper evaluation of the learned materials.
Very informative although its a little bit too theoritical.
Need more hands on activities.
Because, as they are, they don't even compare in difficulty to the junior college courses, much less the university courses, I've taken in the past.
Good introduction to the fieldGood presentersPoor illustrations during courseThank's
I learned a lot from this course, but without getting the programming projects and exercises needed to reinforce the understanding, it may be hard to retain some of the knowledge.
It gets better the third week.
I like to know more methods and technics to develop a game world, considering genres, mechanics and gameplay options.
It should have been spread into at-least two modules.
Much of the courseware was outstanding.
Is there something wrong?
Concise overview.
Very simple overview of the UX process.
1 week of the machine learning course is about equal to this whole course.
I had initially started the course in order to gain insight more into the role of wind energy, the operations, the components and financing behind it.
The professor is animated and clearly loves her subject.
I'd rather say it is not made for someone who has no basics in 'advanced' mathematics.
On the other hand, assignments are extremely difficult and frustrating.
can be much better with little bit of more explanations and more relevant resources for help
Also the second professor was to difficult to u
But teachers should be clear from the begining, what topics one must grasp before getting one's head into it.
Take for example something that was said in week 4, lesson 3.
One must have some R knowledge prior to take this course.
The lectures and scaffolded exercises certainly exposed us to a lot, but it would be hard to say I really learned very much.
And there was not much guidance on how to determine that search term.
Otherwise the homeworks are absolutely interesting and suitable for new-comer.
I was expecting a bit more after the great first course of this specialization.
This could for example include more background information about the artist or a comparison of different pieces by the same artist to better understand the artists' views and development through history.
Quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad.
Very nice course but a shame you cannot do any of the quizzes without an upgrade to the payed track.
There is very little music involved and a lot of social action.
This course should be longer and more in depth.
However the course contents practically depend on the film and book by Swimme and Tucker; so at the beginning of the course one is shown the complete film, and over the ensuing weeks a particular book chapter and its corresponding fraction of the film is presented again; the quiz (which is very little demanding) at the end of the week is basically based on those contents.
Materials made easy to digest.
Can be mprovised in terms of course content
As an application science area, more practical assignments should be provided, as can help students learn better.
This is a 6-week open course teaching a complicated research area, Natural Language Processing, so most of its topic cannot be discussed in detail.
More examples might help students relate the information better.
I
I would have preferred there be an in depth analysis of an application of PGMs in the literature over the lengthy programming assignments.
Please include supplementary materials on controller tuning.
I think the course has very limited practical problems; so for beginners in NLP and text analytics, it is very difficult to grasp all the theoretical concepts presented in the course.
I abandoned it after the first couple of classes presented by extremely boring teachers.
Reasonably good, but less structured and organized that the first course.
I hope the next one will be better on this aspect.
Good tools.
5*(star) to the content of the course and especially the tool used to explain and learn the BI concepts.
Some of the presentations in the videos were not in the style of the course (e.
g.
For example, question #5 " Which two of the following..." and then in parentheses it says to check all that apply.
I really struggled - coming from a zero programming background.
thank you profecsor
This course has felt irrelevant in comparison to some of the other courses in this specialisation and this has a very narrow focus which doesn't help.
Very excellent course for beginners.
This stepping stone approach is surely the most effective way to equip a person new to a subject field so they can then broaden their knowledge base.
Very good for those who start, inspirational for whoever.
I felt there was a lot of code samples to be pulled from, almost so much so that you barely needed to write javascript.
More difficult material = more exercises.
The course was great but there were some quality issues; such as incomplete instructions in week 3 quizzes and some errors in numbers.
This is a major problem.
This course is good introduction in digital marketing.
His favorite word is uh-um.
Didn't get much into the managerial aspect of a data analysis.
There are dozens of ways to make questions a more rigorous and authentic assessment of student knowledge; I'm sure you know and practice many of them in your face-to-face classes.
The option to repeat the quiz fails as an assessment because the questions are repeated identically even after the incorrect answers have been indicated -- and in the multiple response questions, this means that the correct answers have also been shown.
It provides the right guidance.
Surely under the Fair Use provisions of the Copyright Act parts of the Beatles music could be played as well as parts of YouTube
I liked the class but it seemed more like intro vs. a class of any proficiency required.
I found it better to slow the video down to 0.75X the regular speed to hear him but that did not remove all of the difficulty.
Just look at week 5 discussion forum.
If they would do a few problems similar to those in the quizzes, it would be much more better.
At least, almost anyone uses it.
I very much enjoyed the information contained in the course - however I did find that it was difficult to apply some of the very nuanced biases to the financial problems posed in the quiz when many of the biases were used in examples outside of the stock market in the course readings leading up to the quiz.
In my opinion it is the main part of the language, and should be included.
The assignment was confusing and the instructions were not very clear.
I enjoyed the course material and the idea behind linking Buddhist concepts with psychology; I just found some of the videos a little dry.
Thanks for the try though
Wharton's online MD can not have a course so poorly develop (lectures vs quiz vs material)
Should have given 0 stars but gave 3 stars for Jogesh Muppala as he is my favourite teacher when it comes to MOOC
More technical aspects could have been touched upon.
Also, the sequencing and lectures seem sometime a bit disjointed.
May I humbly suggest an idea: Integrate the key points of this course relating to real-world examples and the sharing of real-world experiences into one of the other courses.
Thank you.

Room to spice it up!
there were several things required in the programming that was not covered in lessons.
Due to the course having been compiled from Prof. Shiller's regular lectures and short videos added later specifically for Coursera, the course in overall seems ragged and lacking an encompassing narrative.
It was a fun but some of the assignments required deep thinking.
Expected more based on the arduino course.
The Course material and method of testing the understanding of the student needs to be improved.
It's a good start.
The course was too easy for my taste to be considered worthy of a certification.
if you are looking for a killer course on this topic , then this course will disappoint you .
best suited for very beginner and some refresher for the older guys .
Also I think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking.
Good overview, could be more robust and thorough!
Instructors should use white boarding to explain codes.
I posted a request for clarification and received no response.
Full of great information, but still a bit in "beta" stage.
The interviews were great, and useful to see a real experienced designer, however the contents in the course were almost nonexistent.
Among other peer reviews would be preferable to the current way of testing...
Exam is fair and reasonable.
Quite useful and interesting.
Tobias Kretschmer ... 5 starsCompetitive Strategy .
It was very confusing all the tutorials around the platforms.
My only suggestion to this course is that they need to improve the quality of the video(not the content) and increase the difficulty level of the exams.
the "practical" part is not really existent
However, it still is insightful and inspirational as, 'Writing for Young Readers' is taught by two established children writers and, packed with interviews of other writers from all around the world.
Lots of application that are discussed within the course have been updated, so the tutorials are not longer relevant.
Furthermore, some questions in Week 2 test are confusing, the original meaning the test designer is trying to convey is, which dictates what the right answer is, isn't clear, giving too much room to interpretation not allowing the answer to be empirically right.
This seemed more like an advertisement for healthy eating with it constant music and sparse content.
My happiness went down after this course.
Kids master their native language without getting the ability to teach it - and this is the true knowledge even though in the farewell video prof. Sejnowski equalized the ability to teach to the knowledge.
I was on scholarship so I did not pay for the course but it was disappointing that there was no moderation of the peer review side of the homework.
Extremely hard programming assignments for people with little or no programming background.
DEBERIA TENER SUBTITULOS EN ESPAÑOL PARA QUE ASI FUERA DE MAS FACIL ACCESO PARA TODOS.
The course is fine but the obligation to pay for reviewing quizzies is a mistake if the course expects to get good valuations (in stars) and promotion.
I can tell you that my mind wondered constantly because of the lack of passion and interest in the subject being conveyed by the presenter as well as the monotonous delivery.
Although the topic of the course is interesting and significant, I think that do far it is the least engaging of the specialization...
From the basic layout of the course you would assume it's for beginners since it covers step-by-step instructions to install software and run command on command line window.
But on the other hand, many advanced concepts are slipped in this course without even basic introduction.
Lots of topics crammed into short videos.
Not to much of interesting, but interesting
You're reading academic journal articles, watching multiple videos from another Coursera course (which actually focuses on the topic of NLP, and takes place over several courses and several months!
Topics about Supply & Demand were interesting.
Rest was too much theoretical for me.
I can only imagine the directions the conversation would careen, how many diversions and reversions and tangents we would go on.
However, each module feels somewhat a bit disconnected from the other ones.
More timely and relevant text material would have greatly helped in broadening our understanding.
The discussions highlighted exciting aspects of their power in simplifying complex problems involving uncertainty.
Pretty well structured class, but quite expensive considering very limited lectures and assignments that are mostly "find your own challenge on the internet".
There's just something about the course content that is difficult to attain.
Module 4 very convoluted.
I think I will have a better idea of what to do once I actually follow the techniques.
)A good introductory class to have a first glimpse at the general context of academic publishing.
Far too much 'buy my book/go to MY website'., in it.
I gained a solid conceptual understanding of Machine Learning, its terms, problems, and solutions.
I had to do a lot of googling to figure out how to do stuff on my own.
Mistakes in the PPT and her presentation skills do not meet the expected standard.
Temple Grandin is a great documentary and I appreciated hearing her perspective regarding tactile sensitivity.
The basic ideas exposed during the course are interesting and good food for thought.
In addition you must pass all tasks, which meant I actually failed the course by getting the second top mark you can get on the last assignment despite passing all the others (a fair bit of work put in),
I learnt some useful skills and tactics in order to develop a negotiation.
Elementary and entertaining with some unique and creative prompts.
People who are looking for deeper knowledge about SCM can opt this course.
A typo (its vs. it's) I noticed in a later lesson graphic (maybe lesson 6 somewhere).
Hi all,Course provides interesting insight to getting and cleaning data.
I mean, due to the unclear assignment requirements, we cannot review composition for composition's sake.
Sometimes the instructors seemed to be at a loss for words and stumbled along with arms flailing.
There was no involvement from the professors at JHU or the folks at SwiftKey.
I would give this lecture a three because it is a very independent and useful course, but I feel like the presentation skills could have been improved upon and found the information very dry.
No sense of her brand.
For some reason I thought it would be a little more advanced.
Only average.
Syntax of the notes and text is in need of major editing-proofreading.
I encourage you to take my words.
Interesting material and good teacher but very poor use of the media (an audio file would have been sufficient for most lectures) and low quality recording for some lectures (background noises, echos, wind...)
The quizzes were too short to be effective, and without requiring written feedback from peer review, the process doesn't seem very useful.
While peer review can be useful for learning, I don't think it's an accurate assessment tool.
Good course, but sometimes I missed some supplementary reading material... when I couldn't quite understand something from the videos alone, it would have been nice to read up on a topic.
This course didn't teach me much about Data Science or the different areas to pursue after this introductory course.
This is a great course if you want an introduction to cybersecurity.
so felt it was a bit advanced in parts.
Was difficult to follow.
Too basic, not very informative.
The material in this course is very interesting, and many of the musical demonstrations are extremely helpful.
I liked the course contents, but in my opinion the slides should be more modern, and the main idea in each lesson should get more highlight, and the ideas to retain too.
Buying the course book helps to overcome this.
A lot of this is covered in Roger Peng's ebooks "R Programming for Data Science" and "Mastering Software Development in R" (both are freely available- google them).
Assessments: The only assessments in the course are 4 quizzes- each of which involves about 5 short programming exercises- and a final project which only involves topics from weeks 3 and 4 (specifically- subsetting data, sorting data, reshaping data, and working with regular expressions).
The information in the course content does not match up with the quizzes.
However, I recommend a paid subscription to get the most out of it.
Professor's enthusiasm and passion was contagious and greatly appreciated.
This course is a bit repetitive and provides only a few real life examples.
The first part should be geared towards querying data and focusing more on just pulling data and intermediate queries.
As I mentioned this only applies if you are a total newbie, if you already know some Java I think you'll be fine.
The course is good but I'd like a more complicated one.
Though reference material is good collection but there is total disconnect between video lectures and those reference material at many instances.
Revamp all video series.
However, the course is very short.
However my gut feeling also tells me that those who have had 0 experience with excel will not be able to follow the models shown in this class.
Materials (video and written) only partially prepare the student for the quizzes and course projects.
However my lack of background with the topic discussed cause me to stop watching everything.
Generally, presentations should be better prepared, too much figuring things out during the video.
Although very challenging, I learned a ton.
Real live scenarios of running a project would add a great deal to the course.
For example, they rely quite a bit on data from 2011 and 2012 and from social tools and reports from IBM.
For someone completely new to the social space, this could be a great starter class.
I would request that the instructors work through modules in real time that are similar to the quizzes.
Nowhere near as useful as the first two courses.
Would have greatly benefited from links to resources to learn more about all the subjects.
If the intention is to give a "flavor" in 4 weeks, then the material needs to be distilled down into more of a cookbook format.
Had the playspeed at 1.25x the entire time though, otherwise they talked too slow.
Basic course with videos running too fast......
Also, some of them were region specific tasks.
Not as much creative flexibility as I thought there would be.
Then, I was struggling with the suggested library (tm) until I got support through the discussion forums and someone suggested me to use quanteda.
Then thinks started to run smoothly, or so I thought.
Sessions by Erik surely are a 100% pertinent and consistent within the full syllabus they were conceived for, but inserted here they break a bit the overall discourse, in my view.
However, for a person with no previous knowledge of basic programming, the assignments would be hardly possible to complete or would require far more hours.
The quiz could've thrown the right answers after finishing.
Have another 2.5 weeks to go but I will look for more courses from LMU & Tobias !
But it is a little too cramming for me...
Huge gap between lectures and assignments.
It would have been better to break the philosophy, the ethics, and the science of emotions into separate courses.
However, I did find the readings quite useful and intriguing.
Looking forward to learn more.
The first was from Stanford ML course which was very specific to implementation in the Octave language.
Objective C is big enough on its own without trying to teach C, too.
Decent course, except in the last week it felt a bit stitched together from parts of a previous course and a new one.
Though the course is most likely too easy for most university students, it is also very abstract and I would have liked having to do a little more thinking on the real-world examples myself.
I believe it would have only added 5-10 more minutes in one or two modules to do so since there were so few examples given (This could be covered in subsequent courses within the specialization - I am not sure yet as I will be taking course #2 in the specialization starting next week).
The assignment starts with a simple example in the videos which the student can reasonably replicate and create their own version.
"Is the file submitted as PDF?
Not very practical one, but it does contains a lot of information in the course.
Nice abstraction about all kinds of games not about a specific game genre.
I think the course should include a little project.
His lectures are really well structured, intuitive and clear.
It is an interesting course, however, it focuses a bit too much on current students and test-taking.
I would have expected lot of case studies, and links to additional material for individual reading plus a mini write up or a project at the end.
For MOOCs to compete with a degree program or an onsite instruction few of the things I think that are needed areInterviews with industry practitioners which is a big plus.
interviews/postings from people with similar background as the 90% of the MOOC students of this program who made it... this motivates the students from dropping from the middle of the course/specilization programslinks to additional articles that the students can read at leisurewriteup/project as assignments that the students can pursue and publish (not necessarily for grade but as a mind jogger)One more thing that I think should help (not specific to this course) is that the student with the best grade should be offered one free course and think this will motivate the students to complete the courses.
Would have appreciated more in-depth examples in the lectures though, as I often found a gap in the lectures and the questions asked in the quiz.
There is solid content here, but I couldn't help but feel a lot of this stuff is fairly standard OD/management material and in some ways, it felt like asking, say, a project manager to deliver a data science course.
It was hard to take notes because there seemed to be a lot of skimming of subjects and jumping around.
In a peer review situation, the feedback is quite general and so doesn't take up the slack from the lectures.
Should be free certificate.
Lessons on html and css are very good, better than other coursera classes, so I suggest you to give a look at those.
We're not learning GIS to analyse data because we don't have much data available.
T
It does cover some interesting information about the relationship of music to speech.
While I was disappointed that HTML forms weren't discussed, this course provided very solid information.
The lecture's videos show very little coding and they're more focused on explaining (redundantly) a key concept.
I believe it would be much more easier for other people taking this course later on if the videos were more code-oriented.
Greetings.
As for the problems, they were the main source of learning, but were also at times a bit frustrating (the splay trees starter code was rather sad to look at).
The professor is very enthusiastic and it makes the course fun to watch.
Could be improved.. the ideas seem disconnected there is no clear flow of the ideas presented in different weeks and the specific actions to formulate a strategy.
Quite comprehensive, entertaining course.
The tests should be much much sharper.
Fourth, the reading material should be improved vastly in terms of English quality, structure and presentation of key points.
Liked the course, but it was a little easy (took four days total to do the material for the whole course).
With my Accounts/Business/Finance/Statistics Graduation/Post Graduation Education and Teaching & Work Experience, I believe the Professor/Educator who Designed and Presented this Course requires atleast a Basic Training before putting together an important Course like Accounting Analytics.
I have met part of my goals of taking this program.
The course contents are composed of some superficial concepts of cloud computing.
I realize that the goal was to avoid being a dry-as-dust droning professor, and that is commendable, but there is a happy middle ground between that and hamming.
I struggled with some of the instruction as I couldn't get the exercises/quizes to work right; even with multiple views of the videos, posting questions, etc.
Good for starters..
I think it is always a good thing to ease students in with a less challenging intro course much like a video game begins with an easy level and slowly gets harder.
I think the course was too superficial and didn't cover enough topics to be a standalone course.
More on the history of SEO rather than tactics.
The course is comprehensive and covers technical, social, economic.
I also was disheartened with the "just around the corner" sales-pitch refrain in this course "in your next course, you'll have access to...".
I think the theory is too dense, but with a weak link with R. I understood better with swirl than with the videos.
Recommend the Introduction to Financial Accounting Course from UPenn, which is more informative and more engaging.
But, for undergraduates and beginners, this is a good introduction and for them I would rate it 4 or higher.
The topics are broken down into manageable chunks and a few interviews with other people help to add interest.
Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests
I really enjoyed weeks 1 and 2.
I wish there were more practical exercises or home works to play with the concepts.
Good overall course, basic and got me interested in cooking again!
All in all, it was a great primer for satellite communications.
Also, some of the optional material, is required for completing the assessment, which a bit unfair.
Seriously, I spent probably 10 hours on the final assignment which said it should only take 2 hours.
It gave the feel of the course a bit of "quick to market" feel, particularly given that it was a week late in getting started.
Overall though, I would recommend it.
He did note that motivation is the key.
It only focused on the fact that men are violent and almost no discussion of women being violent towards men.
content is good but its not made interesting.
The overall premise of the course is strong.
Just read the comments on some threads.
You could also get this info from watching Youtube videos.
If he doesn't have the right box to put them, he would either miss the next balls, or put the one he hold in his hand in the wrong box.
Bottom line, the best teachers are those who focus on the concepts (and context) and make sure that the concepts are well understood before introducing details to stuck in these concepts.
But the instructor did not give a brief description about what it is, instead it just goes on about when you do not have clear question in your mind, you would run the risk of data dredging.
I think the course could be organized in a better way.
good, but not enough ..
SS noted that she would instantly recommend the student change to "calm abiding" meditation whereas the CP could not change that student's meditation technique to another technique (such as calm abiding) as her research findings would then be invalid.
The extra/outside content provided is great.
The whole course can be completed in 1-2 hours
However, there was no demonstration by the teachers of the course.
In short, I was not feeling prepared, let alone analyze colleagues.
The scoring of the Peer Review, was not really measurable of your effort.
Homeworks are way to easy.
Thank you Prof. Anders Holm.
Ideal for a beginner, but I had some previous experience with PFA.
the 3rd week quiz)
The course topics are great and I have to admit that I learned a lot during this course.
Positive: Approach to the topics is solid, readings are very valuable.
Negative: Some videos in week 3 and 4 have audio issues.
Its a good course but not very exceptional.
the assignments have nothing to do with the presented material.
No clear explanations and the quizzes are worded super vague and filled with with bugs.
This course does not teach thoroughly.
The whole eco-system is based on Graphlab create which is not very commonly used in the industry.
A very basic introduction.
The content was far more theoretical and left me looking for applicable information.
However, the course is too abstract.
Logistical hassles tainted joy from the delivery.
An interesting course even if you don't complete the assignments because you can expect to get around an 80% even if you fully grasp the subject matter due to the peer review requirement.
I'm new to Business Strategy, with previous background in Engineering.
(Did I mention it was FREE?)
May need more diverse real-life examples to relate.
One such example is variance.
I found the course interesting, however I had trouble finding all of the written materials to read.
I was expecting more information in nutritional science.
Still there's some useful tips for us to choose good food and improve our health
Too vague on topics
Also, a note for presenters, please be aware of how distracting so many hand gestures can be.
The predictive text is interesting but simple exercises are needed to clearly teach abstraction and interfaces clearly.
Congratulations to everyone who took this challenge.
Somewhat dissapointed that only the built in Datastructures were discussed and done so with too much time.
a good course, especially as an introduction to Python 3biggest drawback: assignment autograding - if something fails, you do not know what fails, only that it fails (no info about test cases and results; negligible feedback from TAs)
However, there is almost too much information to take in , and absolutely too much information to be able to study in just and hour a day.
In this lectures the main focus is rather politics than policy.
Only skims the surface of Big Data, even for an introduction course.
Rough around the edges.
For graduates this course is more time consuming and dosnt recommended.
Advantages:-very simple descriptions-even a non mathematical background student can easily understand-Proofs in all forms(geometric, analatic, practical) descrition.
Disav:-basic are explained and consuming too much time-dosnt going for advanced level-no high level explanations or topics.
Recommend others to attend this online course to gain required intro knowledge on diplomacy.
This course covers important aspects of techniques used to solve popular problems.
The construction of quiz items is a particular opportunity for improvement.
Course 1: Learn Ruby, Course 2: learn about databases with rails, Course 3: Learn about HTML,CSS, JS, etc.)
It's useful to anyone who wants to improve writing skills.
A lesson with discussion about the question of quizz.
I would give it a 4 but there were errors--modules/titles/questions didn't match with some Week 1 content.
This course takes an alternate approach to understanding modern Art, moving it away from categories based on the time period in which art was made or what school the artist was part of and instead groups art work by theme.
That is understandable, as a lot of it relies in mathematical modelling and statistics.
A more useful approach would have been to actually draw-and-talk (good example of such courses are Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Game Theory (esp.
Good mentor responses.
Anyway, thanks for the opportunity to learn about my brain and space.
It's my first course on Coursera, so I can't compare.
The course was good in the sense that we could how probability distributions are used to model real world problems.
Study material was certainly not adequate.
The course is good, but not very challenging.
Additionally the quiz questions were subjective at times based on what was said on video and the formula answers weren't correctly graded in many cases.
This course could have been much better, maybe I was just spoiled by the first course.
All of the courses lecture are great until it reaches week 5 where it's really hard to catch, the programming assignment doesn't give enough hints and lecture in this topic doesn't help much.
(enrollment was spelled enrolment) Often I just wanted to read it the lecture, not hear the instructor's voice but found the written text to be less than clear.
It also doesn't cover all the important subjects, so I would not call it an "FE Exam Review" course as the title might be very misleading.
I had to use other sources to help such as Codeacademy and Udemy just to keep up.
I wish they could let us take the quizzes without having to pay to verify that we have understood the lectures.
Ever.)
I'm not sure that non-technical people would get much out of the lectures.
The professor is well spoken and the class started out very well.
Helpful insight.
Well organized lectures but the documentation is full of errors.
good introduction into the applications of 3D printing.
In the end I just copied the examples from the lectures and passed the tests ... without really getting it.
Interesting introduction to the South, Professor Ferris tries to be as exhaustive as the format allows however the exhaustivity leads to a sense of barely skimming the surface over too many topics.
A lot of topics were just rushed through and little effort was made to make them engaging or interesting.
If this course had such optional assignments that would be great for understanding the concepts with a more hands-on approach.
Lectures are too complicated.
I found some of the topics repetitive and trivial, already covered in previous courses of the specialization.
Concepts explained in a simple and clear manner.
We all can read by our self.
Just be prepared for the assignment, it really needs a considerable amount of patience and efforts.
This course really helps me understand the basic logic behind the modern macro business world.
Too bad you can only take the entire specialization over the course of ~6 months, and not at your own pace!
Excepting some coding on Big Data.
I prefer a hands on approach with peer based reviews as in Gary Burton's course also on Coursera.
However, as I've said, if what you're being asked to do is harder to apply than the activity in many ways isn't all that practical.
Just as the Amy Bloom's course, this course has no descriptive arch and one is left to try and grasp the teaching points in a flood of reference material.
Covering about 2 sections per week is by far too hard to read the book along with the class.
I've got a food-pr Agency.
I was expecting some kind of other approach of teaching this kind of topic.
Enjoyed the assignments.
The course should be renamed as Basics of Research Method.
It is rather disappointing that the final grade achieved is not printed on the certificate.
It highlighted some bad habits in my life that I can try to eliminate in order to improve efficiency while providing better habits to replace them with.
The instructor gave us homework on materials that were not taught in the lectures.
It was more historical than I expected.
In other instances the options available weren't even discussed in the content, confusing the student.
A nice introduction to the basics but I found the assignments a little to easy so I didn't feel competent at the end of the course.
I did learn a lot about business types and copyright stuff, but it seemed like the assignments had nothing to do with the course material.
A few of the programming projects were a bit tedious.
One more thing, though at the beginning of the class, the professor notified that Beatles songs won't be played in the class due to copyright reason, but when students really go through the whole class, it is very hard to follow.
The course isn't that hard but there is a lot of content to assimilate.
Content is good but there is no practice whatsoever.
However, I do wish many of the concepts were explained more clearly; often new concepts are introduced and no clear definition is given.
So you can do the course project without understanding anything covered in weeks 1 and 2 of the course.
Mentor David Hood is fantastic for providing valuable resources to aid you with each assessment and so is Xing Su for providing a complete set of course notes.
Assignments take MUCH longer than the quoted 30 minutes.
That being said, a programming newbie should have no problem following it.
The professor speaks slower than necessary.
They were too involved and very unforgiving of small mistakes.
Most stressful but interesting.
Just taking part of the course material was rewarding.
To simple with little examples
Review comments:What I learn most form this course is parallel structure and sentence variety lessons in Week 4.
This is a good fundamental course.
Too theoretical and too few practical, real life case studies (the main ones are health and domestic worker campaign).
So got my certificate after a bit of struggle.
I'm planning to see other online materials related to week 4 and week 5 , as couldn't completely understand from this one.
Thank you.
The course did ultimately not really gave me what I was looking for.
Though I believe it was too generic in some issues and too technical in some issues without explaining more or less what was meant (e.
g.
For example data architects, stewards etc.
However, I did miss better explanation from some topics...
I love the scale-up part of the course.
The classes could have been delivered by creating more interest.
On the other hand, I felt a little left alone since there was no didactically planned interaction beyond the peer reviews.
I found this course interesting, but a bit too simple.
From the answers of other students that I marked many are non-native speakers of English who hadn't really understood the questions.
It's too diffult for some of the questions in the Quiz.
The content of the course is too general, with too brief introduction of some commands in the lecture notes(slides), I don't think it would be very helpful for the students to deal with some real complicated problems.
Please DON'T RUIN YOUR IMAGE because of this.
Week three material isn't explained at all and for a beginner, it is very difficult.
Very easy material, with a bit boring assignments.
Overall, appreciated Coursera's knowledge sharing.
I came out of the course learning almost nothing, but the certification looks good on my resume.
And I say that if I have a bouquet of roses, 11 red ones and 1 yellow and I were to say that "all of the roses in my bouquet are red" you would correct me, as one is not, and "all" demands 12 out of 12, otherwise, it is not all.
Following the PMBOK guide and covering all the relevant portions in the limited time deserves an applause.
In my opinion, this whole introductory course would just be just splitted and each of these intrductory weeks would be appended as the first week of the subsequent modules to come.
:)
For the cost , is not even near to other moocs.
If I gave it 1 or 2 stars, my review would be clustered with the majority.
Having said that, the teaching style is really conducive to learning for newbies.
In almost all his lectures he covered very crucial topics at a near-shallow level.
In my opinion issues aboard at course are too complex to explained in shorts terms.
But the infomation was value enough for an overview approach.
Thanks.
I was interested in a more technical course related to FHIR and it's application in the industry.
I rather liked the material and its delivery.
And I missed the teaching of good pythonic programming style (something that is more than just script step by step but encapsulate functionality in functions, use advanced programming techniques, test your code and so on).
It provides valuable insights to engage in academic research.
There are some errors on the quizzes in between the videos.
The course is fine as far as content.
No feedback from teachers.
It's too advanced for people with no experience in statistics and sometimes too abstract to relate with
Please include more materials and avoid advertising for other topics in the future courses!
Some of the "lecturers" are just phd students, introducing their research topics.
The teaching content is not at the same level of what required to complete the final project, which frustrated the beginners and also stop me from finishing the whole course.
Mr. Harris is great!
Good course, but could be more challenging.
It is a super-short course and is helpful mainly to give one an idea of what software product management means.
It is like, "Okay now we have learned that 1+2=3.
Nice course but I would have expected more techniques (SVM for instance)
In my opinion, this is a decent introductory course but I feel it relies too heavily on the bootstrap framework and not enough basic fundamentals are taught.
Think the insturctors just thought it was enough to throw a bunch of things together and called it the day.
Digital world is changing very fast and articles from and examples from 2010 and even from 2012-2014 are not actual anymore.
At best you could complete within a week or 2 days.
helpful.
The CapStone Project timelines are not realistic at all - one has to start implementing almost from the word go, the artificial interim reports are distracting if one does not realize that and I think many students are forced to a second session to complete the course.
Just reiterated obvious examples, which is common knowledge.
Topic : 10/10Quality: 4/10Presentation: 5/10
Only the beginning of the first video had a slight feeling of "Ok, I'm a bit annoyed to do this now" but that could easily be a misinterpretation or a strategy to capture interest.
This was a good course, a little hard to follow at times but very beneficial.
Another benefit of proof will be to have a more rigorous framework for variable names in the explanations.
He has a horrible way to explain something.
Every time a smart person comes up with a new theory it's taken as fact.
All the basics for beginners.
If you use the pydata stack, as it is said to be possible in every assignments, you get stuck on the quizz due to variations on data and the algorithm used, so you can't really get quite the same answers.
I thought this course could have been more engaging.
Disadvantages : Lacks Rigour, Lacks Support from instructors , Expensive , Peer review ( this is somewhat bad as most barely give any comments, though towards the end, reviews tend to be pretty good).
The class was absolutely Wonderful, however I don't have the time to go at a student's pace (work , hom, life in general).
The lectures are poorly balanced in terms of difficulty.
I think my coursemates had the same problem; all of the submissions I reviewed failed to discuss in any way at least one of the learning objectives.
Professor was quite knowledgeable, and covered a breadth of topics.
I wasn't that impressed.
The second part of the course is very good.
I just wish we could cover more knowledge and to my opinion, once a course slips under the "Specialization umbrella" it gets ruined and the experienced with it.
There is a pretty big jump from the content to actually completing the assignment.
The lecture was very abstract and difficult.
Week 3 is insane.
For example, the FAMA FRENCH model has been explained thoroughly but not told how to apply in real market.
The first and the last videos of the course, in Starbucks, in a very windy day, they have a very bad audio.
Good basic coverage on children's fundamental rights.
Had important problems with SAS which were due to a bug in the software but did not receive any help from moderators.
Would be beneficial if one could gain official credits or points towards an online degree with an expanded/more in-depth course volume.
The assignments are rigorous and challenging, however, and if you take the time to go through all of the exercises you will gain valuable knowledge.
Some questions are asked at the end of modules when the subject of the question is not even introduced until the following module.
I would expect more "TED Talk" level lectures and materials, with plenty of real-world examples.
Good course to begin machine learning with but it's too easy !
It teaches you three tools to organize your work and home to-do lists.
The contents are not updated to swift 3 and Xcode 8
This course has been around too long for that big of a mistake.
But here is the issue, in mini-exams there are very hard questions.
I really liked the previous one (Java for Android) and of course I´m going to finish the rest of courses.
Course content is okay - there was some repetition of topics throughout the weeks.
No depth in math
what was somewhat frustrating also.
Well I liked the course untile the last assignment.
Although I learned a lot in this course, I found the lectures and assignments to be much too different from each other.
The course was fine, but I think it should be offered for free even if someone is doing the data science specialisation track.
The quizzes tend to be on the easy side and the assignments ramp things up quite quickly.
Budgeting which is the cornerstone of managing money is well talked about.
Very limited coverage on the investing portion and I disagree that intelligent speculation in the stock market is the way to educate individuals starting out on investment.
Also, in my opinion the materials / resources given to this course are scarce compared with previous courses of the specialization.
I wouldn’t take this course again if I had a chance to go back in time.
All hometasks are much more about programing in Java than algorithms.
This course necessitates a bit more practice in Python.
Which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.
In all it's a good course to know some basics, but the data and some of the informations are out of date.
Lecturer not conversant with subject.
In this course, that aspect was a bit lacking
I mean, for a free course this is already a pretty nice job, and I think it is worth to take this course.
It took me the maximum three tries on every single quiz to pass and I did just barely.
However the quizzes are way to hard.
If you know the work-arounds to make the assignments with a chromebook it's below your level.
Such things in a scientific course are unnecessary and may actually be counterproductive because of the reliance upon other students and their grasp of the material.
The course contains useful writing tips, but severly lacks practical writing assignments (peer-review assessment would be great here!).
Writing and re-writing about the teacher's generic game example.
I would have given 5 stars.
Very basic overview of the tools and installation of them.
Very concise contents, and a practical approach to Meteorjs
Very high on generalities and low on details - like detailed readings of individual poems.
The fact the the majority of the instructors just read their lectures and many of them never look up at the camera at all makes this seem very lazy and impersonal.
Personally for me who had read about neurology, psychology and human behavior.
However there were several which were incomprehensible.
Good course, although no proctor or supervision at all.
short but good introduction
This course provided some god information on version control and file naming conventions, but a lot of the lessons just refer to the DDI protocol.
the content should be presented more interesting.
Did not like the peer-graded dynamic, and also the lectures were pretty basic, I felt that it lacked depths in some subjects.
Close to 4.
But Statistical Inference is a mixed bag for me.
First, if you are thinking about this course, take some time reading the other reviews.
Mostly common sense.
Completed it in a day but haven't read the recommended texts yet - which I will do.
A solid course for those who require a refresher on certain grammar rules.
In other words, it teaches you how to write R code that kind of works, but does not teach you how to write good code in R.
May be we need to more videos with good examples of the topics covered, I mean good examples that go beyond the basics about topics such as buffer overflow and cross site scripting
Although the instructor was terrific and the subject matter interesting, you cannot take the quizzes/tests without purchasing the course (I like to test my retention of the material).
I think the best quality of this course is that it is a short course, which bolds the most important facts in our mind.
The information is almost always related to its application to young populations.
It was way too hard compared to the material presented.
But it is confusing for the first class when you have no idea about the topic.
The videos and presentation are fine.
The exercises are quite easy and the main problem of the course is that they are review for other students withput any teacher assuring that is right.
Also I felt like Prof.
Shiller sometimes did not explain all the concepts to the full extent which I felt made it a bit difficult for a beginner like me to fully understand what he was teaching
I found the production quality to be low enough to be distracting.
The difficulty of the assignments increases fairly dramatically week over week.
Great overview of Bitcoin, solid foundation in Blockchain.
Quite interesting course, I would prefer more practical examples.
For an introductory course, you really need to move fast and stay focused as there is a large amount thrown at you in a very short time.
It seems, some assignments are missing, too.
The course resource page with detailed documentations is really helpful.
Personally, I enjoyed the course.
The articles, videos, and slideshows were well constructed around the theme of each module.
Great videos.
Similarly, I think the scripting and performance are in need of being stepped up so they don't detract from the course.
a little too much for my taste, but I learned a lot cellular biology.
I feel like more examples, case studies, or panel interviews would help.
it is good to know what are the measurements, but if we won't teach about that too, the more concrete informations and not numbers would be more informative and useful.
It needs more examples to get the idea exactly
I feel like participation in the forum posts was also weak.
You have to go to other resources to solve the math questions.
The simulations are OK, very practical and comprehensive but there is no math information about the movement or equations of motion on the slides, off course, if you have the matlab code you can do reverse engineering and aim the goal.
There was anything innovating in the course and the intro of each lesson was extremely loud.
The Prof slumped in his chair and clasped his hands in front of his chest for most of the course and spoke in a wispy, pedantic voice that made me uncomfortable in my body to listen to.
If somebody is new to matlab, it will be quite difficult to do even the easier tasks;-the evaluation function for the last assignment is extremely slow.. it took me 40minutes to evaluate the results.. and considering the many iterations usually required for (randomly) finding the gains this really doesn't help.
Summarising I am quite happy about this course and glad to have done it, but please fix the many problems in the assignments.
Organisation of material is not necessarily the best, but the course is definitely worth taking for Finance newbies.
It is targeted to business negotiations.
This course is a better option to start with programming and that also with Python.
I think parts of the course are only relevant to such innovations.
His hands can hold a limited amount of balls.
there are so little video tutorials, and too many exercises without video instructions.
The code submission auto-checker is became a game of getting formatting (whitespace, returns etc) to match perfectly vs. actually submitting working code.
I am someone who usually tests well and have been struggling with most of these, even when I read all of the handouts and take notes.
So, if this same course could be broken up over a slightly longer time and the quizzes could be more uniform, the lectures contained some slides, the course would be a brilliant introduction to philosophy overall.
Intro session was very repetitive.
Interesting but not really practical.
I would have liked to do more programming (modeling of robots, controllers, etc.)
I struggled with the lecturer's style (spoke too fast).
Very interesting but i don't like switching e-learning platforms
It's ok...
A minor nitpick: course description suggests that there are 3 instructors presenting, but I only saw one.
But we spend money so that somebody teaches us those things.
The first week was a bit slow, but things picked up a bit after that.
Decent course to get an introduction to portfolio theory.
The quality of videos was pretty poor.
Additionally, this course won't introduce anyone to forgotten and erased artists of the past - women are largely absent from his history of rock, even though Janis Joplin and The Supremes didn't come out of nowhere.
I feel the lectures were clear, the supplemental swirl assignments were beneficial, and that the discussion boards were fruitful.
Pros:Some useful terminology if you want to ever communicate with someone who does recommender systems.
Cons:Very diluted content.
Mostly large text slides with the presenter talking in a monotone voice.
Programming exercises are done in Java and require deploying an IDE + an unused open source project developed by the authors.
Some good material overall, but the notes are not correctly formatted, tests are not formatted that well, lessons are not that clearly structured
: (
I found this unexpected and really it's unrealistic to be able to create a decent prototype in the same amount of time given to write a document.
About the grading system: to take the best score, you need to go "epicly" beyond the call of duty.
and how to use them.
It's important that this is the live code.
I can read this guide on my own outside the course.
I felt like some videos didn't really further my knowledge.
Compared to other courses in the specification, this course content is too shallow and brief.
In that regard, I felt the course began to be oriented more towards students rather than working adults.
Good content for a short duration course.
Many reviews say the critiquing is the draw-point of this class, but that is all done by fellow students not by publishing experts or professionals.
This is not a bad quality-price course but after working Accounting and Finance IESE courses I have to say that this one does not have the same level.
It's a good explanation about the technologies used on smartphones but it mote a comparison of what we had and what we have now.
I don't think this is a way to encourage learning.
Some of the material was not useful in completing the assignments.
However, I think this course is good to evaluate whether you like the teaching style and the overall style of the specialization.
More basic than I was expecting, I suppose it is an introductory to the specialization.
The lessons are well planned and articulate the subject matter in detail.
It is no that perfect.
The instructor focus on explaining what the code do instead of implementing it in the same video.
I think the only downside is that he prepare his code and we can't implement the code at the same time because it is already given
Survey course.
A little too theoretical and the subjects are not easy to follow.
It should have more step by step and deep explanation (math stuff).
The interest rates vs bonds are difficult for begginers, it should be transmitted in different ways.
The sun orbiting us proving wrong, easth is flat, gas giants only orbit outside the habitable zone etc etc etc.
I didn't get real knowledge from it.
Capstone should have been done by the same (high) standards as other courses in specialization.
It might be better served to break it up into even smaller sections over the course of something like ten weeks or even twelve instead of cramming it all into seven weeks.
The lectures are enjoyable, but often they consist of nothing but the professor speaking.
Well presented and clear,.
However, further reading of the resources presented will augment what has been taught and to better handle the quizzes.
The assignments were very basic.
I loved the ear training videos.
The fact that you cannot submit the quizzes and the final assignment unless you pay for it is awful.
Content was far too basic in my opinion.
It provides useful information for writing professional emails.
The subject is interesting and the instructors both seemed very competent.
Still I wish the course had been better prepared as there were lots of sounds defects: you had to adjust the volume during each video which is tiresome.
Very confusing course for those who have no previous experience in Java.
I did about 4/5 of the course.
If you're not passionate about games like tic tac toe, it's hard to maintain focus :) I love the teaching however, very well done as usual!
The information was great, what I could get to, anyways.
I generally rate them 5 stars.
)Maybe it's there somewhere, but all MOOCs should disclose when the lectures were recorded.
Videos are okay.
Very tough course, mostly because of the amount of work expected.
it is good lecture to learn SCM in other concepts
It's misleading people to think bonus as materials related for the class.2) As the name is programming for everybody, will be better if some of the explanations or slides can be linked with daily life cases for people to understand the concept easily.
Too basic, not enough coverage of topics discussed.
I was hoping to learn more stuff I didn't already know.
comment #3 should read:* 3. other activities (leisure).
It's a good introduction, but more optional hadoop exercises can be added.
They were more business focused.
The class has a lot of good information but I felt as though it was a bit disorganized.
The data document for assignment is a mess.
A bit of a mess.
But the two first to basic.
Some questions referred to topics which came in the next lesson
Would have appreciated practice problems and case study practices like the operation analytics class
Very complex and tedious subject.
I definitely feel like a more confident programmer, even though I do wish the instructor could've explained some things in more detail (like when to use the dot attribute notation over the setAttribute method).
And I was impressed by the teacher's track record.
But the lectures were difficult to follow, and I still have no idea how to get started with nanotechnologies after this course.
It is not much without the other courses so you either take the entire specialization or the benefits are not that big :(I feel like the specialization courses are an artificial break to a real university class... if the university class had only the content from those videos, that would not be enough.
Too little substance, though I do expect the rest of the series to be good as I take this as a setup course and my expectations for those are high.
The speeches seemd disorganized.
I must say I feel disappointed especially when the whole Data Structures and Algorithms series take this course as the selling point ( "you'll learn how to compute the fastest route between New York and Mountain View thousands of times faster than classic algorithms and close to those used in Google Maps", blablabla), but it turns out to be the least challenging course with only elementary introduction to the big topic.
You definitely need to have R open when following along with the lectures.
It helped me to recollect the some areas of Exc
Still, it takes me weeks, not days, to understand what the professor is doing.
It is true that there are several online tutorials with regard to using the sketch tools contained within Fusion 360.
Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.
But progress is there.
By using a single line command solver, student may lack the foundation for harder problems in the real world.
When you are a student yourself, how can you be expected to fairly grade your peers?
Good Course
On scientific and philosophical reflections there are unbalanced focusing and biased approach to Enlightenment tradition of thoughts and Utilitarions views in particular, on the very contrary to what Prof. Shapiro explains in his MOOC "Moral Foundations of Politics".
Very interesting topic and great instructors.
Unfortunately, many things were not covered by video lectures.
It had a good structure and interesting additional readings.
It looks a little strange that no one reviewed the materials: neither on Coursera (I am sure it is not so easy to review every course) nor the creators.
The course is interesting.
The peer-review assigment and grading system is the weak park of this course : you are asked to do a prototype in one week that must be reviewed "pretty epic" from the other students for the highest grade.
It lacks of video lectures so I had to rely on notes only.
The length of the videos is the only thing I dislike.
That should have been visible in the mobile app.
I would have appreciate a more comprehensive explanation of content on slides using markers or pointers.
The course provides the right platform to folks who are newbie to python and gives meaningful information for development on Raspberry Pi
The only reason why I'm giving three stars was because of the submission process for the final project.
The instructor is clear and the videos are very concise.
Positive experience, but not exceptional.
Not enough material was provided
There must be something wrong to spend time on google&wiki much more than the course content.
Some grading question are inherently subjective "Is the code at least somewhat efficient?".
It is a good course that gives you a general idea about how to manage your time.
I would've enjoyed a more in depth course.
good content, but slow pace.
It was interesting to learn on how to better manage my time, although was too theoretical.
Some weeks take longer than other weeks, and you don't really know until the week starts.
First, there are some audio issues in the videos.
Effective but could be more detailed.
Just relying in the videos to assimilate the content is not an effective form of learning.
Inappropriate rating was done for me.
Four hours per week is all you will need to finish it with good grades.
However I somehow feel it lacks a more systematic or scientific approach since lots of the materials goes on with a free and open discussion that very much depends on subjective views or feelings of selected individuals who joined the discussion.
Adding up on the same files instead having one file per exercice / one learning key point does not help.
The course is all comprehensive about models and concepts of communication science, however the break-down into small lectures turn out to be too brief in my opinion to develop rich understanding of the subject.
The solution of the problems usually turns out to be quite simple, but is not applicable to a large set of problems, only to the particular dataset that is given (and the characteristics of this dataset is not given; so I end up thinking about all possibilities that might occur for that dataset, which makes the problem more difficult).
The examples given in the problem set are also not sufficient to describe the characteristics of the problem clearly.
However, I really appreciate the whole courses, and I think it has been a great experience to go through the courses!
It gave me a headache because I didn't really understand how to submit to Tableau public.
Very good introduction course for motion planning.
I got bored listening to the instructors continuously telling us what they were going to tell us, repeating themselves, and then telling us what they told us again and again and again... Also WAY too many UMMMMsss from the instructors.
Nice but quite simple.
In this course, there were a few quizes (which aren't as nearly as useful as projects) and the only projects that existed were to simply follow the steps exactly as the professor did in his videos.
although it gives an introduction to R, however the structure of the course overall was not up to expectation or objectives of it.
the videos were very much theoretical and boring.
The teacher explains concepts very well.
A good course overall and beneficial in almost all walks of work :) Thank you !
There isn't a quick summary of topics covered in the video you can go to.
I think I need Calculus for Dummys!
But otherwise a decent introduction to those not familiar/ experienced with business/ start ups.
PDF Course (Like a school)
If I could not answer one question correctly, it meant I could not answer two or three of the next questions, meaning that I could not pass quiz.
Nevertheless, it inspired me to learn from other sources to fill the gaps in my understanding.
Also add sources.
Perhaps a more case-study driven course would have been interesting with more qualitative, essay responses required rather than cut-and-dry multiple-choice.
I loved everything about the course content, but peer assessment is a TERRIBLE idea.
For one submission I could get both the highest and the lowest grade, without any feedback.
There are ample examples of the fact that the anger of white men can be effective when the anger of others is counterproductive.
Quiz and especially assignments were poorly written.
Consequently the quality of the reviewers are of the same level as the student itself - which obviously limits the learnings from feedback.
Pretty basic but good
i think i need more time to finish this curse
Even so, the audio on this has got to be fixed, especially since this is an audio class about mixing!I learned a few vocal layering techniques, but this is a really beginner class and is very DAW-specific; if you aren't using the specific software, the information here will only be valuable for topical concepts.
Labs are ok, Lectures lack interaction (just slides presentation) and the monotonous tone and long sentences of the presenter makes it hard to understand and difficult to pick out important points.
The quizzes were extremely tricky with too many choose more than one answers.
For me, since I do have some Java experience and a programming background it wasn't too bad, But I'm thinking of the guy who has never touched a line of code before.
It hase some points, but most of the training is looking on what the other courses are.. Like paying for commercial :-)
A bit american - but I like it!
Seems like it is more for managers to understand what the techies are talking about.
Had that been readily available (without an exorbitant fee to data providers), I would have rated the course with 4 stars.
Thanks for the course.
It was pretty good, though.
Unfortunately I feel the level of the course is too low.
As somebody said on the forums "I feel like I'm alpha testing your course".
The quizes were also poorly tied to the lecture material and some of the questions were ambiguous.
It would be better to provide references for optional reading or reviewing.
I just could not finish the entire class.
I had to rely heavily on online resources and help files to get answers to things I think should have been part of the course material, as this is an introductory class.
Overall the course provides a good introduction to the swift language.
I had to skip a lot of them because it wound't accept the correct answer.
a good course, especially if you are not too aware of Autism
Things won't work, you won't know why, and there's no real recovery from that.
Decent introduction course however examples are very simple as well as the models that are constructed.
It deals with difficult content clearly, thoroughly and at a good pace.
Assignments are good and thought-provoking, but not clearly written.
The course is too simplistic in my opinion.
Otherwise, the class so far is useful.
but in generally is so good and helpful!
Too many details sometimes about specific providers, something that in my opinion may not be really useful but overall is okay.
The lectures in this course were very good but I would have preferred much, much more homework to practice the concepts covered in the lectures.
Also, I was somewhat disappointed when a certain issue with the course that I asked about in the forums was never addressed by the course staff.
You are on your own.
While the quizzes test the concepts learned, no live help is available.
What kind of responsible one provide feedback in two words, where require to answer three questions (week 4 assignment) to review.
Furthermore, a forum for discussion is nice, but it's a little sad if no one can answer course related formal questions, you misinterpret the instructions, and therefore receive a low grade.
I was a little confused because for having a focus on "Science and Philosophy", it seemed to me to mostly talk about science and religion through a philosophical lens.
After going through this class and reading three of Steven Batchelor's books I have the distint feeling that I may have reached the end of the subject.
It's quite involved, fast and not explained thoroughly in some places.
The organization of the lessons sometimes feels out of place.
It's very basic and sometimes trivial.
The content from the instructor is very, very brief.
Course is good in general but "HIERACHICAL CLUSTERING" part is hard to understand and is not clear, should be explained more.
Too high level
The previous 3 courses was pretty good, but the assignment is tooooooooo easy, and this course has lot of redundancy, which i think it is not necessary, but overall, i think it is good
The teaching style does not help in getting the right code to work.
It's a good class, but I enjoyed the first one in this specialization more.
It would be beter if we had a lab assignment instead.
Interesting, but elementary content.
I have taken many courses in coursera with long and short videos, with boring and engaging teachers but this is by far the worse.
Some of the terminology doesn't seem congruent with what we use in North America
Lots of bias on evolutionary theories.
Save those for a later course, or put them into a separate "Extra Challenges" section.
The problem in my opinion is that the content is too superficial.
The course was ok, just an introduction for the specialization.
It was quite good.
The range of technology covered was good and would be useful.
I was hoping for something a little more scientific and a little less home-ec-y.
Not enough detailed.
I think University of Washington or Coursera should have said this at the description of the course so people can decide better if take it or not.
the course contents are great and understandable but I have a problem with the lake of details information the instructor sometimes forget to provide..
It would be better to see a concrete problem solved, and explain why the steps taken are used.
To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the "additional resources".
Our assignment required the use of JavaScript but it didn't fully explain how to use the code that was shared during our class.
The text is fairly good.
In several cases, I had to use external sources to understand the content and/or derive it by myself.
Nonetheless, the course brings forth a lot of Neural Net topics and is definitely worth taking if you are willing to study outside the course also.
Many of the images used in the quizzes were very confusing.
The quiz questions don't correspond to the information on the slides.
The course is not bad I would just say it may be too simple even for an introductory course
You learn a lot.
Ok course.
Good class - links and slides have not been updated recently.
I felt that there was a bias towards anthropic principle.
Just a bit of thinking process, and you pass with 5/6 or 6/6 score.
Overall, the course is attractive because of amazing videos.
If you want to use something else the tasks are often badly described or it is impossible to pass the
Great theme for a course, perfect idea, but I had some issues with execution of it.
(2) They are energetic and funny.
Cons:(1) The course uses proprietary and expensive tool.
Nevertheless, the course will give you the incentive to try and learn on your own, with the help of Rforums, the Coursera discussions, Google etc.
(Summary of what was said).3 - match the video and e-tivity focus.
Lot's of mistakes which confused the student.
I could have read them off the screen faster.
My least favorite aspect of this course is that you can't take the quizzes without buying the certificate.
I wouldn't for example be encouraged to take another course from this series (not sure if one is offered).
However the content is way too easy.
We focused on data analysis instead of basics of data generation.
This course is way tooooooo easy for me.
I have taken many courses online in different platforms and this was so far the most time consuming one..
For example, the assignments seem to assume knowledge of functions not covered in the prior lessons.
I have a programming background and out of all the quizzes I just missed 1 question on 3 of them, but I've been trying to answer them again, and again, and again and I just can't get them right.
Wish there were more details on where/how to get started and practical examples to support it.
More feedback from test cases would be very helpful.
If you're planning to take that specialization, you should start with this course.
This was an excellent course, but rather brief.
The course was good enough...
but exercises were very simple.
The last week was quite difficult to follow.
Professor Aric could use a little more energy as he had a very scripted feel to the lecture videos which almost felt like he was reading from the marketing dictionary.
However, for someone who already knows the basics of Live, this probably won't be of too much use.
The content is really good, well explained=> 5 stars, nothing to add.
Why the 3 stars then ?
They dont test the understanding but the learning capacity of the student.
I am hopeful that the information I've learned in this course will show its usefulness in the future.
It would be fine if I had received some feedback showing where the problems were.
this course was super boring and the video lasted so much time
I think some of the materials deserve to be discussed more comprehensively.
Its a solid java class that has almost 0 android learning.
I would prefer if the course lasted 6 weeks so we can get a better understanding in theory and practice every single bit of the code.
And although I don't disagree that this course provided some wonderful input to creating a game, I felt that it was something that could have been done in a single lesson.
This is not a university level course.
The topic was fascinating and the teachers presented a perfect lecture, a great balance between deep but easy to follow.
Needs better on camera presence and ability to communicate the ideas.
In general good, but not updated - seems from around 2013, so the new developments are not mentioned.
That makes be believe that it's within the realm of possibility that the caliber of the MOOC be increased significantly.
Thanks, for learning how to learn ;)
I just wish the course focused more on dogs
The web interface was better but still difficult to work with.
The iOS app would forget I was in the course and lose my assignments.
^_^ Xie Xie .
So, you can finish this course even in a day if you have a sufficient time.
This course is very difficult.
Assignments are challenging, but some questions are very vague and require lots of trial and error guesswork to get the autograder to accept them.
Quite low level of detail - skips over lots of the underlying mathematics.
I had to read the subtitles to understand.
The course needs to be updated.
good course all basics
Overall, pretty decent course.
And his habit of bringing the dog into the classes was supremely bizarre.
And if you have very little teaching experience or are interested in the field, it will give you a clear overview.
There could be more work in the assignments in this course.
It gave me a framework to go along but what is presented in lecture and assignments are completely different.
In last 50 years some states got independence, some states do not exist any more and staff must be familiar with that.
it is definitely an interesting course.
I felt the course was ok, but wanted more.
The solutions to the exercise are not covered in the course material.
The was no discussion about personality, psychological test or other tools.
I got some skills out of it since I obsessively plotted everything and over did the assignments, but the peer grading rubrics are crap.
However the concepts are well enough covered to be usable in practice i belive.
The programming exercises where ridiculously simple.
The course introduces the student to the production of a game using Unity, but it lacks on programming focus.
This course gives a good introduction to international criminal law, showing in details the evolution of key principles and institutions.
The only thing I did not fully like was the we could not learn any of the characters.
thank u so mach for this course it was simple and pretty good for the first 2 weeks i really enjoyed it :) ; but the other two weeks though ... i had a hard time there , if you try to improve it , the js wasn't understandable at all or at least mention in the course info that js background needed !
The assignment doesn't correspond with the content of classes closely.
Assignments didn't really reflect the complexity of the content that is taught in the lectures.
The lectures are interesting for those who have no prior knowledge about the topics, but boring to those who have it.
The course was very simplistic and more targeted to a new manager or a student who has never taken a conflict resolution course.
Matlab is very out of trends nowdays.
In reality it just makes everyone learn less.
I didn't feel engaged and half of the time I was just wishing the video would just end.
Very Slow...
And Craig has done a great job at demystifying it.
Good introductory course but a bit too superficial.
I am almost done with the course.
This would avoid digressions such as explaining basic vector/matrix operations or unnecessary calculus reviews.
And please update the language for SWIFT 3.
A much awaited end for a very compelling specialization!
From my own experience, colleagues tend to underestimate other people's projects.
It would be nice to have more practice with some of the different formats (e.
g., JSON) and for exercises to loop back to some of the early content.
Good basic course for money management
Additionally I felt that the course was a bit out date already, it was recorded in 2015 and I think I would have liked it more if had only been a year behind vs. a year and a half.
It gives a nice overview on genetics, and it was made accessible to many of us.
I would have like more help in getting python and its complements install.
If you are a finace or business student this is not for you, its a complete re-run of most of the basics that re taught with some practical real life examples.
Everything was in the Korean alphabet.
as already explained in the preceding question, this MOOC is less well built and thus useful than the preceding one, partly due to the lack of time and efforts to present the tools, among which the score, the savoir relier protocol which stays on the whole quite theoretical, and some of the leadership models which are given too short a time for students to really make themselves an opinion about it.
too many interventions from Oriane and references to what was certainly a nice show, would be good to balance testimonies from young students with more development coming from mature managersthis said, on the whole the MOOC stays a very interesting activity, and my last word will be to thank the team and wish for the SR community to become live, as I have found the conversation a very useful and surprising method.
It felt few content, i think there could be more content in this course.
It also helps to get all the tools in place to be ready for the other courses.
As a marketing professional and child of the digital age I feel like the course didn't go deep enough.
And the method of grading is also only explained in the discussion forum.
Entertaining course, but only for those who are totally new to personal development and branding.
I would not recommend to a completist!All the same, thanks to Heather for the wonderful work she's done putting it together and the excellent lectures she gives.
Further, for some questions the right answer is either not given in the choices presented or the grading protocol doesn't recognize the correct answer.
Solid introduction - slightly disjointed and fairly boring presentation.
I do understand there's many people doing this, but if other can, why couldn't he?
Expect to invest about four hours in his videos and still have questions.
Hello, I'm Giuliano from Milan - Italy.
The slides look like they were thrown together in a rush and without much care for design or even spell-checking.
The information in the readings was helpful though.
I think it would be good to include into course following topics:1) NoSQL databases2) ORMs
However, the way it is presented needs a lot of work.
The question and answer format of discussion was not a great idea (might have been great for kids videos).
I had many instances where my right answers were marked as wrong.
I will give it a 3* review as I really enjoyed and learned a lot in the HTML and CSS part (first 2 weeks), but the java script is really poorly covered.
The course was an interesting way to explore writing models to explore climate change.
Only a number facts discussed may be of interest for most music student, and these are contained in any decent introductory textbook of music anyhow.
Better to provide real life case study example that shows how people using a particular system can really be more productive than before
It often seemed that the questions in the quiz weren't properly covered in the material provided.
And only 3 weeks the instructor could not make these knowledge areas which I list in point 3 clear.
Professor typing on he keyboard quite loud.
Very informative and helpful.
A failing unit test should at the very least explain what the test was, what the measured value was, and what was expected.
Interesting information, but not that information dense compared to other courses.
Teaching was as great as the first 2 courses, and slides were useful.
The accompanying book is good and I am still looking forward to the other courses in the sequence which move further away from my limited knowledge of Python.
I think the way the material is presented and how the assignments are laid out I do not think someone(or not many people) would have gotten through that Week two ascii assignment.
HW is a bit boring
The videos seemed to present a lot of painfully obvious information, however, and I'm afraid they were not terribly engaging.
I have studied several Romance and one Semitic language but I was unable to understand the lectures here.
He's entertaining and he gets the concepts across very clearly.
Don't get me wrong, this is a good course, the teacher obviously knows his stuff and delivers the information in a good way.
All the forum sessions are empty.
I wish that the videos were longer.
The course's content is interesting and has potential to give learner more depth of topics.
Very interesting and applicable advices.
this was so boring
Should I install from repository or a Version Manager (like RVM), the gem concept, what setup do I need, etc.
the lecture gave industrial terms and key words which is good but it is mainly reading from the slides, no elaboration or illustration.
The instructor's teaching style is too monotone - I didn't get a sense of her real world experience coming through.
I have to admit that the professors know the topic and are conducting amazing research, but the course was dry and terribly designed.
Great Instructor videos, bad assignments and peer grading system.
(Just like many other courses on Coursera) And only when it passes the automatic review, use peer grading for coding style.
Course had pretty good basic information for people not familiar with programming.
Also in some topics more detail was expected.
Another thing is there almost has no example, teacher just say the principles.
Too much ideology, need more tools to use in daily work.
Short course.
Please add more content to it.
Appreciate this course a lot, it was crisp and to the point.
but good overall
Great learning overall.
The quizzes are very easy.
The instructor covers the topic in a pleasant and clear way.
I might be studying with people half my age so that's fine.
But by the final section the hands on example were simply cut-paste with no explanation of what we were doing or how it worked.
Pretty basi
The professor + TA's a simply reading off a teleprompter, and they're rushing through everything.
I thought they assignments in some cases were harder than the lessons.
This course as much content in it and it's difficult to have an holistic idea how it all fits together.
Recommended if you need a fast and simple introduction to finance.
The course needs to make at least some of the quizes available for the free users
Really basic info that most foodies will already know.
Very useful and the information taught are well presented
Some of the quizzes were also frustrating, featuring what I consider to be "gotcha" questions geared more to creating a grading curve than to measuring understanding of the material.
Advice to course staff: (1) Please provide more test cases on coding assignments (2) Please provide better feedback in submission reports (3) Please monitor the discussion boards more actively for unanswered questions (4) If you want to provide an externally linked executable you intend students to run from Matlab, it's not reasonable to give a 32 bit file in 2017 and send us down a rabbit hole where you suggest we build the executable from source, which in turn requires us to build the boost library from source.
The quiz and project are far much easier than lecture content.
Some of the things explained in the lessons I would actually look up other videos of other people explaining it to get a clearer picture.4.
There are some good insights and ideas in there, but no way will a beginner be able to make sense of this.
In my opinion a clear guideline is missing.
good but videos are too long
The order and content of the lessons wasn't planned with sufficient care.
A decent start for anyone interested in learning the basics.
Even though the video lectures, discussion forums, swirl & reading resources are informative, there is a huge disconnect between the assignments & what is taught.
And it does an OK (but not great) job at teaching Algorithm Performance/Optimization.
The lectures and starter code could use some better integration.
The assignments could be improved.
I'd have enjoyed more challenching exercises about RESTful APIs, we have not seen any HTTP mehotd a part of GET and that's a shame.
Too different for beginners but not deep enough for ones already know R.
Still has useful pointers, but they could be summarized on an A4 sheet.
I don't really like the format.
It gives little grasp of the difficulties involved in ML.
When the ONLY visual is the instructor, it gets hard to watch.
There are only tests.
This course has a very clear goal.
I like the material of the course, the interviews but I think it is pretty strict with the answer(s) the ask for in some of the first assessments.
The assignments were good but it was a lot of time spent with the grader.
plotly and leaflet and methods for handling spatial data.
But the instructor is very charming, so it was a pleasant experience.
That's when you can pay attention to him and understand it all.
I learned less than other courses from this series.
Tips aren't the same as methodologies and content in character design.
However, this course could be designed and organized better.
I found that the momentum build in the first course of the "Game Design and Development" specialization was lost when going into Principles of Game Design.
The answer input sections for the tests and quizzes were rather frustrating because I had to type very specific keys on the keyboard just to input a constant or a polynomial.
Good overview, but lack in details, lectures are to short.
It's not an approach to the accounting problems, like finances, a game company may have, but mostly an approach to the bureaucratic problems of creating and publishing a game.
As for me, I am looking forward to interesting and in-depth topics to learn about.
I just wish there were more content in the class.
The course was extremely easy.
I don't think we need to stop so frequently to ask a quiz question though.
Also, there were math mistakes in the course material that are easy to fix.
This course definitely enhanced my marketing knowledge but I recommend it be updated.
But in one of the quiz question, there was one of the possible answers referring to the geometric distribution.
Real world data warehouse integrations are more complex than just inner joining the tables to drop those rows not found in the original tables.
Indeed, there are references to material from those courses that are not actually included here, which must be a little confusing for anyone who hasn't taken those courses.
I must have missed the jokes after watching each video 5 times...
For the record, I almost aced this course.
its a very basic course helps you a lot if .
Great explanation of punctuation rules.
Good examples given, but sometimes I do not see how proposition can be used on daily basis
Perhaps I'd give more stars if I only saw diagrams.
Very good and simplified instruction.
One of the things that I didn't like is that I couldn't complete the course because, without purchasing the course, I didn't have access to the assignments / quizzes.
The material is OK, the video quality is regular and the instructors are childish.
It makes no sense to learn without knowing where one is making mistakes and how to correct them.
Simple, but useful.
I work daily with matlab and had some difficulties in following what it is done.
Hence, it would be great if more examples were given and the inclusion of an additional assignment at wk 2 would help too.
Would have liked more than 3 weeks
more needs to be taught in class.
The book was really good, but I think that Dognition was too expensive, especially if you haven't a dog (not useful).
I love it!Just not that systematic.
good overall conversation about food
Many of the explanations were started but not finished and the presenter had many breaks during his speech to think or to go back with a better explanation.
Has interesting ideas and approach to forming a structure way of analysing a problem.
Hope it will be improved soon.
But it was really interesting.
I believe the instructors assumed the students had a more rigorous understanding of the underlying calculus than was suggested for this course.
That's a nonsense for a finance course, but still.
Also, Graphlab is built on top of python2.7.
Further when comparing, two concepts, it is easier to comprehend when they are in table form.
interesting and informative course.
I found this Course less well prepared than the previous 3 modules.
The material is well explained, but there is not much of it...
ancient civilizations.
It is getting difficult to understand the concepts with the examples explained.
It is in fact impossible to upload more than a single image, but there are no instructions on what to do about this.
I was disappointed because the name is misleading.
Very interesting material and well explained, but videos are quite plain - borderline boring.
Technically I can, but the deeper understanding is missing.
I found the course interesting though the continual music being played in the background was a distraction for me and felt like a brainwashing exercise.
No step-by-step examples of developed cases are shown.
It would be great to have tips on what to do on a day-to-day basis as an artist in the digital age.
the course seemed to be more geared to artists/composers than technicians wishing to expand or futher their skill set
Definitely recommended for people who have no clue about European law whatsoever.
Also, there were questions on the quiz that weren't even covered in the particular module.
Also , how to calculate the expected returns from a stock has been taught using beta , but whats the duration of the returns if one buys the stock in the middle of the year.
The course is useful.
i supposed that may be i am not very clever so the content and the question after the class also make me confused.
The best part, for me, was the week 4, about magic in Islam.
Found the ODE examples very useful.
lectures were well done, but the strong focus on using graphlab ruined this course for me
The course material is very good.
I would have been happy to have a whole unit on Eudora Welty or B B King or the Chitlen Circuit.
There were times when I questioned my own sanity until I read in the course discussions that others were experiencing the same issues.
Either leave the video on the code the entire time and run the audio for the teacher, or, add another window where the live code is visible the entire time.
Just an intro and learning a bit about Git and Git hub.
Technical analysis as a whole is a bit sketchy subject but this course gives a good intro to it.
Very boring presentation.
Week 4 - too much of materials, and test questions does not match the text
Informative course for anyone not familiar with the ancient Egyptians; The quizzes have a low (50%) threshold in order to pass, but are not always easy.
Without a specification the user cannot write his own tests.
Not fun.
I have passed the course (89%), but I won't even try another peer assessment based course.
It's such an irony that (aspiring) teachers were not able to assess someone else's work properly.
But the lecture videos are too long.
Tougher exercises should be added and more time should be spent on the Hadoop Ecosystem part.
HTML and CSS were well explained and clearly cover.
The part where our own importance is challenge is enlightening.
I should have tried to learn of the background required for this course.
Superfluous but the existence of the package "caret" covers the gap of other libraries like "skilearn" of python
A good course, but maybe a little lacking in depth.
Despite all of this, I have learned a lot from this course.
It also misrepresents the usage of semicolons.
This is a pretty basic course.
This makes experimentation (like grid searches) a bit tedious.
The games needs to be explained in sufficient details.
Giving this course 3 stars is generous in my opinion.
More historical context would be appreciated.
It really disappointed me.
It course may be better appreciated if taken as part of a specialization.
Also during the course itself it would be nice to show us how to combine several formulas into one line - I had a bit of difficulties with that.
It is a very neat and organized learning experience.
It was a very theoretic course.
I would have enjoyed it more if more real life examples were compared with all the theory.
At some points I found it too tedious, even though I found marketing an interesting subject, I have to say that the last 2 weeks I found it really hard to pay attention and follow the class.
Ways to improve it: More real life examples and more visual explanations.
The content is definitely interesting.
The 4th week felt like the first 2 weeks...
terrible.
I would be delighted to join a hands on FHIR course
It seems to me like the course could have like 2 or 3 times more video concerning tasks required
This course is divided into 4 weeks.
Related books are given after each video session.
Much was common sense, although it was well put together.
Also the final quiz is just a repetition of questions we see in the module quiz.
Many of the low rating reviewers actually did pass the course and said very similar things as those who did not pass the course.
Another reviewer enjoyed Brian's dry humour.
This could be improved by adding more interesting subjects :- how to use list adapters with list view- how to use menus- how to use scrolling view- etc
DEBERÍA SER LA DOCENTE.
I did not find what i was looking for.
A little too basic
Pros:Good concepts.
But so easy for anyone to watch and learn.
Extremely lightweight and totally missing in substance; I cannot recall whether they stated so in the course goals.
Almost not worthy of course status.
I've got the chance to practice writing and I've learned some interesting insights, but I think the instructor didn't put too much effort into this course.
Slide show with good information about the domain, but nothing practical.
I would still like to pass, as I feel that I really earned the certificate.
That will probably be a major disincentive for many learners who want to confirm what they have learned.
Also, UCI have elected to disable the discussion forums for this course (although I found they could still be accessed via the Coursera App on my Android phone).
As a woman in an industry dominated by men, this was disappointing because I don't believe that I am any less deserving of a place at the top table, but this course made me feel like those kind of jobs weren't for me.
Still - I find it a very well designed, concise course.
The instructor does much better, information is easier to follow (better and slower explanations), and the instructor is more engaging when he is not reading from his notes.
At the end I do not feel that I have learned something.
1.
So ironically, is that not a sign that it's ...
dare I say...
a GOOD course?Would I take the course again?
e.
g.
The course is fine but very short videos and lack deeply explanations.
It's a good course with a lot of information.
And people think I used three squares and thus not following the instructions.
Learn a lot that I have never been aware of.
Course logistics was lacking.
Having said that I couldn't really recommend it to someone without any prior experience.
And although the content is thorough, it is dull and the assignments uninspiring.
If you want to know more about grammar, good (be sure to bone up through, because she assumes a lot about what you might remember from high school and for those of us over 40 ... hmmm).
If you want to feel inspired to write something of value and interest to yourself or others, not so good.
Over all I would not recommend this course or series of courses.
I believe this course is great at all, but I also have to say there are a lot of machine learning algorithm should be taught in this course, such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, etc.
Too theoretical for my needs but gives a good background to how to approach analytics.
I mean i get the logic but if you guys can please give more code...
I am learning data structures for the first time and it is bit difficult for me to grasp it all and write codes in a week...
This is the second ML course I have taken.
I believe the information regarding tools and techniques could've been presented in a better manner by working on live files and displaying it.
There's no practice exercise to strengthen what you learn.
Not the best one on coursera.
The only topic that got a (somewhat) deep dive was serial communication, and it wasn't clear why; users of the Arduino don't need to understand it any more or less than any other aspect of how an Arduino works.
There were other issues.
He could, for example, show how these methods would apply to food supplies, barter, social prestige, trustworthiness, confidence in people or institutions, certainty about logic assertions, or other things that aren't measurable in dollars.
I believe programming need practice.
Honestly- I think the first two classes are very boring.
In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion (such as regression models and stat.
The Deep learning part is really bad thought and bad examined.
When I finally understood the content I couldn't understand why it is presented in such a cryptic manner when the concepts are rather simple to grasp and the math not so advanced.
Professor Caffo is a good communicator in some occasion (the module on Power for example was incredibly well communicated).
Also, some of the introductory notes were lacking proper grammar and I believe that, in a course with such a theme, this is simply unacceptable.
The assignment is difficult
The Instructor is excellent and easy to follow.
Good as a starting point.
Scripting went right over my head.
Rhetorically, many of the lectures were preformulated written texts rattled off, sometimes quite fast, in spite of the complexity of some of the information.
I don't buy that coaches pitch as genuine.
I felt that the programming assignments were not explained well enough, things like different syntax that wasn't explained and such.
I think more examples would have been better for the class.
they should ask for something specific and explained well they should test conecpts not asking for whatever idea you have, apply what you learned I think this is an old school method.
Great course but content and quizzes need updating.
This is a good course, but be sure you have a foundational level of understanding of Macroeconomics before starting - it doesn't provide a lot of background before diving into more advanced topics.
It's at the time of writing the only Swift/Xcode/iOS MOOC on Coursera.
Needs to structured a bit better.
Answers to discussions if provided will be very helpful and help analyse situations in the way instructor aims to.
The MIT Case readings, not 10min things, thos cases are all like 20 pages+!
Swirl does not allow you to follow up so clearly.
I am a bit disappointed.
A simple response of "this was answered incorrectly, points not awarded" isn't very constructive and was often frustrating.
I look forward to additional classes from this university.
Insights delivered by the course were great.
sometimes is dense, a little bit boring
Bad agenda = bad results, good motivation will cause good results.
Moved too fast.
I figure I can read a paper in 5% of the time someone else reads it to me in a video.
It required great deal of own searching and trials and errors to complete the course.
Ideas are introduced but not considered in depth.
If you are running python 3.0+ on your machine youll have to install a python 2.7 instance.
Otherwise the quality is solid.
mechanically it worked pretty well.
The lecturer is honestly a bit slow in his coverage of content and his scribbling is untidy.
The information is useful, but I think the five courses in the specialization could be merged into a single one.
Teach theory in a clear structure first please then provide reference.
most of the contents can be found on the website of raspberry, a quick start for those interested~
A separate class for spreadsheets and modeling isn't bad perse.
Considering that it is an introductory course and the fact that it utilizes the GraphLab library as tool, I believe it is overpriced compared to the other courses of the specialization.
For beginners it's a 5 star course, once explains a lot of really too basic information and the instructor is more like a buddy than a teacher.
Intermediates will literally fall in sleep, because of the excess of basic explanations and no intermediate or advanced explanation at all.
As an Advanced, this course disappointed, not only because of lack of important information that not even in forums was answered, but it depends too much of the good will of mentors assistents.
One big fall in this course is that's only in video, so no option to do it while in motion, like in a bus or any other noisy place.
A bigger one is that's totally dependent of others students to give the grade, so you stay hostage of others and the instructor or mentors do not care about it.
The biggest fall is that you will always pass it, once you can try some many times as you want, so eventually, you will pass, so the grade is just formal, not serious.
The good side of the course, is that it seems to be very completed, so you will learn all the contents you need to work with AngularJS.
I suggest providing detailed lecture notes besides the videos for students trying to understand math and physics behind the concepts introduced in videos
I am a bit disappointed by this course.
In general I like the course but I find it a bit boring.
The professor is very knowledgable.
Very.
He's present a summary of the video while displaying a Tableau screenshot and then repeat the same summary while displaying a Presentation slide.
The quizzes seemed to focus more on what was said during the lectures rather than what large scale constructs actually define entrepreneurs or processes overall.
The rate of the speaker's speech was also very fast.
There is a very technical portion to this class making it difficult for the neophyte to truly understand and explain course content.
Good for understanding the various types of neural networks, but I had hoped to spend more time learning methods for optimizing model fitment.
This is a five week course.
Some more practical exercises or more readings in fundamentals could be a nice addition.
The discussions and videos are interesting, buy I am confused about the use of "music" to carry the course's agenda.
the lecturer is kind of boring
Rest all is great.
Learned a bit more about python.
The course should have more details.
Course should include the slides that were presented in the video as well as some additional reading material (available for free)
3 starts represent the median value
Its learning curve is almost vertical.
Its too bad, otherwise I would offer 5 stars.
The first two weeks were great, they were more behavioural economics than behavioural finance specifically.
(Whereas it was patently obvious Dr. Klein & Anam Thubten were definitely "walking the walk", so to speak, so were able to speak from the heart.
There was not much of depth.
The ones for case studies are especially tricky.
Programming assignments in Assembly should be used to evaluate the grade in addition to quizzes.
The slides are excellent and instructions are clear and to the point.
The teacher is not very enjoyable to listen to, however the content is very interesting.
If you enjoy reading academic papers and peer reviews then this course is for you.
The instructors are great and the material logically detailed.
If you are a beginner in OO not recommend .
This course really should be more focused around Python or be more flexible in general.
Contain could been more in depth.
It was extremely high level.
so interesting and they got a very talented way of teaching
I am not interested in teaching art, and reading same facts about artworks that I've heard in lectures is waste of my time.
Lots of information, but could be presented in a more learner-friendly manner.
Most contents of Amy`s classes are abstract.
Saying that though, it is good to learn about different perspectives and approaches as education whatever form enables us to move forward on our learning path.
It could have been shorter and more concise.
Last recommendation: improve the presentation materials.
The content and scope of the course is too small.
It is too basic.
Instructor said that we are not cover this point in this lecture in different lessons several times, so skip over something until this course finished.
For example, in week three, the topic was understood to be something like "Management Skills Applied to Research" but the material pointed to something totally different.
Also, you can tell that the course is not anymore groomed and there are some mistakes in a quiz due to lack of care.
More basic than I was expecting
I am a native speaker, and I certainly learned a few things.
Very good introduction.
It's more for people who not has managment educational formation looks more like a personal financial course.
The book needs updating, and more exercises would be helpful to practice what we learned in class.
I may have entered the course at a minimal personnel time which may account for my perceived difficulty.
The subject is interesting, but the presentation is dry, boring, in monotonous tone.
Seemed like pretty basic stuff for the cost of the certificate.
Given the importance of this subject, this course should have been split in two or more or have a longer duration to properly address subjects as GLM or model selection techniques.
Some video explanations are not so clear, so will be great to highlight some concepts, theory and methods or technical (with some reading), also will be great exhibit the latest news about toolbox(that is the current topic) or data scientists
The only attractive thing in this course is a name of the author.
Interessant, but it wasn't organized too well.
The material is interesting, however there is not enough information provided by the course to effectively implement the algorithms in the allotted time of each week's assignments.
The topic of capstone is great, but the milestones, and their APIs direct towards bad solutions.
For someone interested in deepening their understanding, it's of more limited value--but it is presented as an introduction.
GOOD BUT NOT A FULL COURSE
I had to look around in all the internet, buying books.
basic knife skills she said don't cut your finger but held the knife completely wrong, using the knife to point at different ingredients).
This course shares a lot of valuable information but could use a good deal of refinement.
I expected to get more in information in using R for inferential statistics too... though there was a presentation and each lesson had followup for use in R. Great use of examples for each section.
Here's some constructive feedback on the course.
It's a very basic course, could have included more material.
Very basic introduction...
Good course anyway!
Interesting review of historical voting mechanisms and their flaws.
Easy to understand course- with real world examples.
CONSPacing was too slow.
Too simple and easy for the 5 weeks of coursework in my opinion.
The future looks promising, though!
All Assignments and Quizzes are quite simple problems.
not enough practical examples.
More visual explanations would help with concept.
The resources weren't organized enough to be fully accessed with ease.
The grading of this course needs to be revised, in my view, as some things will go amiss when students grade each other.
A few inaccuracies need to be corrected so it can be properly pursued at its best.
It should had been included the lecture slides and also external sources for further student development.
Gives a really broad overview of ML concepts.
It is too simplified to get a real view of the 90's economic situation , especially the 91-93 years.
To talk about transition between A and C , better to talk about A and not only about B and C.
It is an useful course for general knowledge of Russia , it as a start , for more accurate analyses I could advise this ( in russian) :https://openuni.
io/course/2/and thathttps://openuni.
io/course/3/
Even though I liked how the teacher conducted her course in a dinamic way with 4 participants I expected more from this course.
The first half of the course is excellent, but slows down in the second half.
I have learned more while reading a book for 3 hours, than with this course for 4 weeks.
The course as a whole is excellent (5 stars), however, the Capstone project part of the specialization consists of 3 submissions that are reviewed by other students.
YOU TURN ME ON
Very basic information, focused strongly on test-taking strategies.
I really loved the dense collection of relevant information, this course is a great introduction to computer vision-related algorithms.
Unfortunately the lecture videos are poorly edited and subtitles are inaccurate, however the slides are quite good and verbose enough to understand every topic.
Assignments are quite good, however formula derivation explanations could be better.
good stuff, but a bit preachy
However, before applying them I will have to visit the material again.
I also went to the forums for discussion, but there wasn't anyone adding new information.
Good overview, but very detailed and definitely not for beginners - especially due to a lack of personal attention.
Forums do not offer much help or interaction.
Lacked water and sanitation element through infectious disease (biological lens).
It seems this course really isn't fully developed yet and is still going through it's growing painsOverall, I would say there are many other courses that are far better at teaching the basics of Java.
Either because of the quality of the video or the very heavy accent of the speaker especially to a non-American viewer.
I'd like it faster.
I expected to have valuable inputs from Wharton staff to my submission.
Good overview for those without management experience.
most contents are explicit on ppt, it is sometimes not necessary to view the lectures.
One big setback is that the course material does not really go into biochemical fundamentals of what is going on, and instead jumps straight into algorithms.
I liked this course for the wide range of movie excerpts which underscored a memory malfunction.
However, lectures and assignments are almost unrelated.
Truth be told this is an insanely difficult MOOC to pass/complete, not because its hard, lets face it, the contents are very advanced and its assumed that students would have background in advanced finance, but the problem lies in the fact that the professor does not explain the topics well enough.
In the final quiz most of the questions had the first answer as the right answer.
Such a rich source!
An interesting course.
The lectures don't do justice to the material content and quizzes.
The readings provided are mostly academic ones which aren't that clear to beginners (even to programmers like me).
In contrast, a Python data science course on another MOOC platform has 4 times as much content with practice exercises after every video, mid and final exams, weekly problem sets as well as readings.
Ultimately the course showed me what I need to learn next to get into Data Science but the first course hasn't given me confidence that the rest of the specialization will be worth the money.
Good course; but the class do not contributed
This course isn't what I anticipated.
I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details.
of Chicago, but this course has been a big disappointment unfortunately...
The course is too very basic and is very slow.
Overall pretty good, but I think maybe the course ought to be extended a week or so to really take time and look at descriptions of the tasks run in the task runners.
The word 'toolbox' made me think there was more in the course.
A few helpful tips but most of the stuff seemed like common sense.
Though the course content itself was excellent, the rating is because of the issues mentioned.
Unfortunately, the student role is pretty passive: you'll just look the teacher at work, you'll not build a site in this course.
Sorry, can't afford it, why not excel?
I did not expect that jump in difficulty and enjoyed the course a lot but the final project just was a struggle.
I would give it a five-star but at the beginning it was confusing how to access certain parts, there were no instructions on ho
It's a good course and the contents are very helpful.
The course's instructors included some of very interesting problems and indeed helped understand the lessons better.
The information is good though.
If you have never touch code before, it's more useful, but little is actually covered here and the gap between it's contents and the next class, R programming is dramatic.
Introductory, not completely relevant to my goals, could be ommitted.
(That assumes the courses are not taken off-line at a future date.)
Block the sending and sharing of activities, and unable the peer evaluation because of a required payment, really handicap the learning and the quality of the course.
The discussions in Madoff, Snowden, etc are positive to stimulate critical thinking.
It was a good basic intro into the statistical methods of epidemiology.
Not good as this topic was not taught in great depth.
It`s not feaseble to start a small diary business in USA?
I do not think it is fair to call it "High-Impact Business Writing" when all you get is an introduction to business writing.
Some of the lecture material did not match the paired video which led to some confusion.
A downside of the ease of the videos/lectures is that they don't really go that in depth, and they're nowhere near the quality I've seen in other Coursera courses (like the Kierkegaard course from UCopenhagen).
It is really just teaching you what data science is, and how to install a few programs.
Would love to take more courses by him.
I hope Coursera will offer more languages since I could not find any other languages in the list.
All in all, I liked the class.
Week 1 & 2 not terribly useful; week 3 (in depth look at actions within dashboards) & 4 (significant content relating to building a story) are what I expected the class/series to be.
Moreover, the failed tests are invariably nothing to do with learnt course content, but trivial rounding/formatting errors.
The course is oriented to alumni that have a minimal experience with design concept refreshing and updating know how with interesting information sharing with the classmates.
Missed Agile Framework and other emerging techniques.
Perhaps most frustratingly, you could follow the assignment instructions to the letter, but after you submitted you might find out that the grading criteria included other requirements.
What this means is that we have to go through some frustration while watching the video first time which gradually improves on second or third view.
So you have more room in your head to behave the way you want to.
I wish the instructor had a little more training/skill in the cooking segments (e.
g.
Takes a long time to figure out the problem sets
The course content is interesting and well laid out.
Both are good but the lectures and assignments did not "flow" together as I would have liked.
Too much information for a short amount of time to compile.
Low production value.
It is a very entertaining broad introduction to the topic of philosophy in general.
But the course was not well organized, and the emphasis on fine teaching that I have found in most Coursera courses was not present.
Good material, but not nearly enough to justify a full course.
They put a lot of effort into this course, but especially for the videos it was a bit too much.
But that point is very limited.
Good information contained within the course which has sparked my interest in continuing to learn and build on my small amount of knowledge.
Too superficial, basic and short vs my expectations.
My interest dropped.
It was too technical for me.
Actually I think this course is a little too easy and not so informative.
but still, i like it.
thank you coursera
However, the content delivery could have been better.
It was covering very basic concepts
This is SO confusing.
I would still recommend this course, but you should definitely record every single lesson again without mistakes and fix those errors.
Actually it is realy demotivates.
I would recommend every one taking this course to do some further research into contraception and find out more accurate information.
Having successfully completed 'Getting Started: Agile Meets Design Thinking' I found this module partially confusing.
The material was good, but I did notice a couple of lectures and in-course questions presented out of order.
The videos are so long in time and not very clear.
I have HTML experience, but no HTML5, figured this would be a good beginners course.
Great as an introduction for many things but, unfortunately, it is not possible to keep on developing the themes presented on the lectures because there is no access to the sources used.
I was urged to skip all the vids in wk 2
Mostly preparatory material and setup activities for the rest of the series.
Its good to get started with server side development with node.
But a very interesting topic.
There were way too many people taking the class but not enough to grade the assignments.
I really had a hard time understanding Dynamic Programming.
It's kind of too easy
Average course, some cool case studies, but overall not amazing and not many business models
Very informative, but the coding elements can be somewhat difficult mainly because there's not many specific examples provided.
Did I feel ready for the final exams?
I asked for help on the forum, but no one responded.
The content is just ok.. but not explanation is very high level.
As for the Statistical Inference course, this course is amazing but is presented in a more complex way than it should be.
It's just Introduction to HTML.
I have also become a great fan of Avinash Kaushik and his blog in the process.
Criticism: The lecturer could have gone into more details in many areas of his course as opposed to just assuming that the prescribed reading material had been read.
This was not a major problem as I was able to Google most of them.
Great introduction to the clinical statistic usually encountered while reading medical or biology literature.
Learned a lot and already integrated daily meditation into my life.
Good interesting material but the quizzes were badly designed and did not test concepts well.
It is very useful for someone with only basic finance knowledge
They are trying to show off so much information and in such a high level language (to most), that it makes it incredibly boring.
Both the lectures and text have good information and well explained examples.
Very helpful tips for preparing a professional business document.
I would like to find a course on global energy that I could start any day, like this one.
If the plugging of own material was removed and the background and tone of voice were altered this could be a captivating and interesting course.
In an Input and interaction course or an Interaction speciality I do expect more other audiovisual support than a teacher and readings.
Indeed, you even need to understand how the French sometimes mis-translate into English, because some words in the answers to the multiple-choice quizzes don't exist in any English dictionary -- you will only understand them if you can guess what French term inspired the bad translation.
right?.
First, Duke has presented courses that have a lot of content, and it is a bit disapointing to only see two modules on this course.
On later parts the videos are poorly edited and less interactive.
Hadoop hands on and HDFS should be much more intensive.
Good introduction for people who have no prior programming background
Although overall the course is interesting, it is clear that it has not been designed for MOOC format.
This course is beneficial to all those who struggle with character plot.
Barbara Oakly was great.
However, towards the end of the course I found that it got boring and not that stimulating.
Some few interesting insights on epistemology, but nothing more
There are too many requests for essay writting and it sometimes feels an infomercial for the school.
It is a very interesting course, but in the beginning it may seem a bit disorganised and slow.
It's still very very at an introductory level.
OK course.
It's fantastic at the beginning of the course.
Good course, but the video lectures are incomplete.
The teacher was wonderful as always.
There is lack of peer assignment, forum is silent.
Videos are short, there is small amount of additional materials,
It isn't as engaging as I thought it would be.
Good introduction course.
More time should have been spent.
It seems like it should be a separate class, really, like explaining what a function is.
Nice, informative, but basic and short.
I would like to suggest few pointers.
This course was not as good as the first course.
2 Stars less because they should have included R video tutorials
1*(star) to the professor very difficult to understand the professor many times.
With the technical problems and low participation I can only give the course 3/5.
Tests are way different than what the Prof. covers in the videos.
The course is very complete on it's subjects and points, but should have more slides and some times be more grafic about some examples, this makes the lessons boring and harder to follow because there is a massive amount of informations.
I can imagine the same class with a moderator and someone facilitating the discussions would get me to the 5 rating.
The last video of week 5 is interesting, but it seems improvised...- There could be more examples, especially from modern music.
Some other tips will also help like repeating key nouns, using synonyms, saying things in different ways.- Use different sentence types- Start sentence differently- Use different sentence lengths- Use synonyms effectivelyConsidering sentence variety will be the last step when you revise your essay, so do not do it in the begining.
I am from China.
I think the courses is easy for a senior high school students.
The course was too easy.
I still miss the teaching style and assignment design of the first course of the series though.
The teacher is not very good at explaining things in simpler terms.
Compared to other courses I have completed on Coursera, this is one of the most confusing ones so far
Good course but slow, each video was quite long with the same concept repeated few times.
However, I think some parts of the class were a little bit dizorganized.
The material presented was of course useful, but I never really felt like I understood how it all tied together, or what the big picture was.
I enjoyed the hands-on aspect of this course.
I feel like we're left behind by the teachers of this course.
Teacher's narrative is pretty clear, easy to follow.
Requires payment to complete the course.
The second part of the course would be more useful to DBAs or professionals that have database admin privileges to insert/delete/modify data.
Generally a good course about the very basics of hardware.
A good introduction to data science.
I'm a programmer at heart.
Do this.
good course, but... paid, I can't submit the task
I deal with communication and I provide strategies to entrepreneurs who want to create new business.
he compared every number every time ....
it is boring!!!
He is awesome in reaching every aspect of Classical music.
I think the jump in difficulty from week 1 to week 2 is discouraging to many students with little to no R experience.
On the other hand, the real theory behind why these techniques work is deliberately omitted from the videos.
This was a great introductory course to graphic design.
hands on experience based content would have been appreciated, Its a good course.
Interested to see if the next course will be more challenging.
I recommend taking the more practical courses in the specialization to get skills needed unless you're an absolute beginner and have no clue what SEO is.
")There are many FREE reasons to take this FREE "Lesser Vehicle" course (the first of four):#1 - An awesome, wonderful hour-long interview with Sharon Salzberg, one of the founders of the Insight Meditation Society.
I really do not see where a data analyst who is not in accounting field would be using the fraud detection scenarios in real life.
Instructions of the final assignment is very confusing, you don't actually know what it really want you to do until you go through all the Q&As in the discussion forum, which is really wasting time.
The course should be longer, more detailed and with more background lectures
inspiring, easy to absorb
Please elaborate each points mentioned in the slide.
The BIG problem with the course is that the level of the lectures no way matched the level of the assignments, especially the last one.
In the 3rd week, there was more equations and hurry to complete the topic, i think.
A little too slow for my liking
I would appreciate less text and abstract drawings on the slide, maybe an intro with images (maybe 3D) of the human body to give a little bit of background on what's going to be discussed in the class...
I got a Segmentation Fault on Assignment one which I never did get resolved.
There are some generic tips, like ("Make sure it is balanced," "it should be interesting and paced right."
Still worth the time if you want to get a good idea of what epidemiology is.
The book really gave more details about the individual chapters.
I would not recmmend this course for someone who - like me - needs fast intro to python.
To get value from the class, I used other on-line materials to understand the topic.
Also should you run into any technical difficulties or have a question that is best answered by an instructor you won't find anyone.
But there are some things that I believe could and should be improved.
Can improve.
This course makes me realize selling is a critical skill.
A Statement from the Columbia University / Prof. J. Sachs would have been welcome since completing the 14 week course imply a real involvement from the student.
Towards the end, unfortunately the professor's accent is heavy and sometimes difficult to understand.
Need to take more advanced courses to gain indepth knowledge.
Not really related to the specialization.
An easy course, though I disliked the lack of Chinese characters (only pinyin - the transcription) and lack of grammar rules.
This per se is definitely not bad (it rather resembles real life), but all the other courses I have taken on Coursera and other platforms provide enough material and/or explanations to be able to work out all the problems without needing to look it up somewhere else.
The problem-solving issue also has to do, to a certain extent, with the formulation both of some questions and answers, which in some cases can be understood in different ways because a key word is missing or is wrong, usually prepositions.
The explanation was sometimes confusing too.
A great course to understand the procedure for non-medicos
For instance, sometimes the WBS did not match with the project activities sequence, but because the rubric/peer review was so broad, as long as the peer put down 10 or more activities, he/she received a perfect score.
The course would get a higher rating if it focused more on practical applications, and not so heavy on the algebra.
When delivering in this format, allowances need to be made for the facts that tutorial sessions do not exist and the possibilities for informal Q&A are limited so any gaps become very difficult for students to fill in themselves.
Despite the above shortcomings I'm glad I did the course and I would still recommend it to someone interested in graphical models as it does cover the basics well enough to make a decent start.
:(
Pretty dry.
Could have more in depth content, a bit shallow sometimes.
It was nice though to receive it in a academic setting.
I believe the concepts are explained in a clear manner but they are too high-level to be considered "learning".
Animation will be the best.
If someone could improve the slides and the video editing could reach the youtube video reviewer/critic level, it could easily do a 4 out of 5.
Additionally, for the grading of the Case Study, there was a section where you could either upload a document or type, then on the peer grading it encouraged you to penalize people for not uploading anything.
Average Speakers and material
It needs to be stretched out into 6 weeks instead of 4 to accommodate those with an already busy schedule.
I love that topic, but I think, the videos are too monotonous.
The video explaining a sample Signal implementation was very rushed and provided too little detail on a lot of information that seems to be taken for granted.
So far it's difficult to say anything about its practical implications and usefulness.
I guess more examples or providing intuition would help me to digest the material.
It´d be good to further consider this aspect and/or see other alternatives like the intervention of the facilitator.
I loved the teaching.
Nevertheless, very engaging, visually and verbally, and ideal for someone who is getting started on nutrition.
Have left comments in the forum, but no one has replied.
I am glad of the things I learned.
In the end, coursera staff were able to override the last bit so I could complete the course, but the experience was quite frustrating and disappointing.
Maybe it's because they way they were explained in the lessons which brings me to #33.
Also too theoretical, more graphs and formulas would help to understand.
I have already recommended the tool to couple of companies.
I'm sure this is a fantastic introduction for those with no prior programming experience, but as someone with even just a little bit of prior scripting experience, I found it extremely slow-paced.
Seemed rushed, concepts not explained fully.
Taught well.
Once i got a message that my course is completed and i can get my certificate but now it says still assignment pending... i dont know how to deal with it.
It looks like some videos are once made and kept as it is.
The instruction from the first three weeks does not sufficiently prepare me for the final project.
Excellent concepts and content.
I am giving this course 3 stars for a few reasons:1) (Negative) Essentially no instructions were given for how to get Graphlab to actually work in Python outside of the notebook.
Moreover, there is room for improvement as far as bibliography and in general additional reading are concerned.
My recommendation would be for this class to be broken into two sessions to really practice everything that was taught in the videos.
Waste of money.
I wish this course was more focused on building and analyzing data in excel.
It should cover better the native idea/implementation about computation as single instruction multiple data, which is not well covered.
Informative and well presented, but honestly you need to make the core readings available online, as it makes it really difficult to possibly get the most out of this course.
Many videos are too long and there are too many.
In my opinion they should focus on fewer things and explain them in ore details.
Audio on videos was sometimes unclear.
This course is good, unique and relevant for machine learning today.
This is a visual programming tool.
lectures notes is not details enough, had to google around other materials to grasp the courser work better
I would like to have more example, it feels there is mostly theory.
I am looking forward to hearing more about that aspect of design.
It was a bit buggy throughout tho.
I little slow to start but the pace picks up nicely.
This class did ok teaching the basics of R, but it did not do anything toward teaching testing of R code (a key part of writing code!
and be active in Coursera forum or leave a wizard to ask questions when needed.5) Notes: He missed the weight of the notes.
I wouldn't say that their way to deliver the message about efficient learning is motivating.
Still missing a document or a file with all the notes that one can take away and use as a reference guide, hence only 3/5.
There was a lot of optional reading made available in week 1, perhaps some optional assignments/quizzes related to that reading could be added to the course.
This course offers very useful high level overview of concepts and ideas which make you feel confident in the long run.
A little too common sense.
I think some more practical activities should be introduce (on free platforms), to make knowledge more sustainable.
I learned more about project management from a different course, which was about the Business of Games.
Also the content became a bit too repetetive (actually started in the second course but continues in this course).
And think about the accessibility of the material to your learners, especially if no previous knowledge is required.
Course have nice subject, but somehow cannot take my full attention all the time.
I was hoping for new information, but for me it was a rehash of stuff I have heard ad infinite.
do not just read out the pseudo code but instead try to visually show whats happening step by step with arrows and calculations from scratch
Greate course for beginners.
It also repeated what was in other lectures for the week.
To sum up: I'm glad I finished it, but I suggest to rearrange it's form - add some videoes, and remove other ones.
all the best,Piotr Milewski
Some contents could be consolidated to shorten session times.
The lectures are great, but the assignments are way too easy.
The connection between lectures and assignments needs to be improved.
It was not clear to me what the expected error calculation in the last exercise was really looking at.
It is incredibly clear and you never get bored even if each lecture is over 20 minutes long.
The tutorials lack in depth explanation of methods work.
The lectures, swirl practice modules, and quizzes were great but they all re-iterated the same basic information.
Fantastic topic on itself, yet delivered in a rushed manner.
Thought it was too easy to be its own course :)
It does not provide enough instruction, practice, or content for the cost.
A good introduction to Workplace Communication.
The resources supplied were extremely helpful.
I didn't pay so much attention to the slides that came with this - in fact, I'm not even sure how relevant they are looking back.
I had expected the overview videos to be an insight to the resource content, but it wasn't quite compiled that way.
The tests could have been longer, and perhaps could have contained obvious solutions - in some instances the solutions provided were all applicable, leaving the student to select the best option.
Very few people in discussions.
This course is OK for introduction if you're not already familiar with the IoT devices and embedded systems.
And find themes as more of a way for art institutions to promote their own agendas and longevities.
Most probably I will try following courses in the specialization.
The lecturer was really great and was able to explain things enthusiastically and simply.
in my humble opinion, the questionnaires are obviously used for the research of the tutors, without offering so much learning benefit to the students.
It is pretty an interesting course, especially the practical tasks, but, after all, it is much better for those who already knows the technologies mentioned in the title.
At least, it would be nice to have the set of outer links to read each topic in details.
I felt there was a wide gap between the exercises and the course material.
All you can do is submit a ticket to get it fixed and hope that it gets corrected for the next people who take this course.
Crazy!As well, much of my time on recommended reading was spent looking for the poetry.
Being able to check back notes fast is important and very helpful and I can't see why they are not given.
Other than that the course content was very interesting and fascinating.
The project was interesting in its way, but it felt 'parachuted in' to this learning sequence.
The first course is composed in articulate way that allows a simple and schematic way of comprehension, but some single parts of the first course seem to be lacking of some information, above all to me without previous experience in informatics tools like github.
The criteria for reviews and assignment direction is probably not too explicit that cause a lot of confusion, and people are submitting very different assignments from one another.
I feel some areas such as strategy, getting to MVP etc could benefit from more case studies and materials to work through.
Graph Analytics should be its own 6 course specialization.
You'll spend time looking stuff up and re-running videos.
The professor was engaging and his work was very interesting, but he said ummm and ahhh so many times that it was a little distracting.
I'm a PhD candidate in statistics.
Overall a good course for beginners like me who knew nothing about Wind Energy before taking this course.
Standart indutrie DAW, but not my favorite.
Very basic overview of the topic.
Thank you for all of your great work.
I would prefer that the hadoop lesson have more practical exercices;
Some questions are presented in lecturing or quiz, and answers are hardly found.
on topics such as debt) but it's anyway interesting to have the perspective, and it definitely makes very interesting points.
This is a very worthy attempt to integrate the history, philosophical underpinnings and modern transformations of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.
Clifford Saron’s Week 2 lectures on neuroscience and neuroplasticity were fascinating and intriguing introductions to the topic - very engaging.
The negative.
Too academic for an introductory course.
Good Cloud Compyting and CDN lectures and material.
Lack of practical examples and use cases in Big Data track.
The forums are a lifesaver, but I still spent a good two weekends working on bugs once I'd got the assignments 70% right.
These slides will cointain information that is given by the expositor.
I feel content of the presentation need to improve.
Overaly 3/4 stars.
Second, the instructor threw a lot of terminologies with much explanations.
The course is worth checking out and watching/reading/meditating on those parts that interest you.
You are left to the other students for your grading and assignment completion, meaning that some of your assignments can hang there for weeks before ever getting reviewed.
I recommend only taking it if you have some experience with syntax.
The lecture is monotonous in the later weeks.
Actually I like the videos.
The quizzes were also really easy, which again, made me feel like I didn't deserve the grade.
Many explanations could be improved greatly.
For example, the course attempts to sketch in the debates about proper use of precedent, with frequent reminders that the task of fully developing such debates is beyond the scope of the course--I'll bet some students were thinking, thank goodness it's beyond the scope.
As a final note, and this is critique I've already submitted, the presenter doesn't add too much to the slides in the videos.
I gave the feedback to the detailed survey by the University of Michigan.
As a working professional, it was easy to consume the course in my varying bits of free time.
Good for a beginner.
the information is outdated, and I have find some examples, services not working anymore.
But the first 3 weeks need quite a bit of revision and fine-tuning.
This course was rather like conventional classroom teaching in video formats.
Would have enjoyed more practical applications for homework.
I thought at first according to the title of this course, that it should be an intro for c programmers.
I really believe the student was feeding his/her ego.
Interesting overview on the topic.
It's a good introduction to ML.
I believe the assessments focus on insignificant details mentioned in the presentations rather than the big ideas that I believed was the crux of the course.
The professor lecturers were great!
However I will say that everyone else seems to be managing so it is probably me missing something
One of the best lecture series for beginners like me.
The last 2 assignments may have been ok for 3 hours (doubtful) for someone with Scala experience, but they really should be marked more appropriately for time for those of us new to Scala.
A good course, but not up to par with the first two.
For me this was pretty stock
Clear but a bit superficial.
Requires much more than a month to digest the material and complete the assignments.
It is a good beginners course but I think there are better lessons in SAS and Python if learning these is your goal, and the content in data cleaning and visual analysis is very basic.
On top of that, the sound quality was simply awful!If the Prof were to take some acting or presenting lessons and improvements to the sound quality were made (or a professional actor hired to present the material) it could be one of the best courses ever, but instead, it was hard to get through for me even though the material fascinates me as I'm learning neuroscience and love movies.
The world of MOOCs are different than your old standard classroom style.
Awesome stuff.
The Probability section could use more practical examples, I found it difficult to follow.
Thanks Dr. Egger.
I would have enjoyed it more if I had had enough knowledge to do the Honors quiz!I downloaded all the videos so I could play them over without chewing up my data, but the quality is so poor you can't always make out the writing - i's and j's all look similar.
cool
There were 3.
It is interesting in the first weeks and at the time I did it I was living in a country that would qualify as subsistence marketplace so could see directly what was explained.
However, felt it was a little rushed, repetitive and not very detailed or clear when it came to creating a business plan.
I also think that some parts of the assessment being measured really aren't important when it comes to us demonstrating what we have learned about blended learning.
If you are looking to learn more about blended learning, I would recommend this course.
Overall, I would focus on the first three weeks and ignore the rest.
Many questions were left unanswered (such as how dependent the credibility intervals are on the choice of prior distribution and the assumed distribution of the data), and it didn't touch on later topics that are interesting (MCMC sampling).
I am contemplating a similar change, and it's comforting to know that it can be done.
Most of the course is useless to me because python 2 and python 3 are very different with beautiful soup and this and that.
There's too many gaps in the presented content for a beginner.
Nice primer for modeling, but wish there were more workable problems to help hit the point home.
I thought this was a good course.
The professor seems pretty nice and the class is great but even quizzes/answers and assignments are only available for payment
Hope the examples are easier.
I see where many topics related to "marketing in a digital world", but most if any had a indirect relationship.
The probability part was in my opinion far better than the statistical, the origin of every new concept was clear.
The last recommendation is to not mix videos and resources.
Even after you succeed a test, I expect an explanation of the questions, and the correct answers.
Also there were too much reimplementation of algorithm
I feel like the topic of technology is important, but important enough for a full course.
This a well paced class which does a good job of breaking down the fundamentals of project management cost accounting.
Nothing about new tags and features.
Good for overview of managing your finance.
I am a composer and I found myself astonished of how much I was lacking, yet, the quizzes translations, man, are so bad, must of the time those where "Straight trough" translations that are complete meaningless on Spanish, it's like they simply used Google translate.
I do think peer-graded assignments work better than quiz in term of UX lessons...
autolayout/specific UI components gotchas
However, there were a few bits that were required for good completion of the projects that weren't covered in detail.
Assignments on your own data.
Quiet good introduction with clear objectives.
Some step by step explanations could be shortened because they seem too detailed.
A brief introduction to creating your own data could be great and will cover more stepsBy hte way, thanks for this good introduction
I learned the basics of different classes of probabilistic models including Bayesian networks and Markov networks and how to represent them.
The course was great and interesting.
Really basic course.
The Jupiter notebook is very useful.
I don't like that many examples are very US-specific.
Also, there is absolutely no participation of teaching staff.
Using the caret package is too high level for a learner.
Although the course structure and information is great, the course exercise and grading organization has a lot of space for improvement.
That's not a critique, though.
In Titles/Headlines I understand that, but why do they write words like "Negative or Highly Sensitive" big within a text or in another text "negative or highly sensitive" ?
Much of the time, he's OK, especially when the camera is not pointed at him.
Pretty Basic information but exercises are good and challenging.
Only one point to take it into account that is regarding the feedback from peers.
very useful content, great readings, but total lack of peer-to-peer engagement.
Very interesting course, although lacks course notes.
The video lectures are informative and interesting, but the QUIZZES COVER INFORMATION NOT ADDRESSED IN THE LECTURES!
*All models are wrong.
It is a good course, but the quiz/exercises are very difficult, and sometimes, unrelated to the topics
There were some technical challenges that made this course not as fun.
Very good course.
I just don't think the course does a good enough job at explaining things to someone like that.
I really hope the next courses in the specialization are better organized than this because starting with the next course because the next ones are more important to me than this course was only because of my prior background
Really good organized
If you have absolutely no foundation of what the basics of business, then this is for you.
Professional communication should be clear, correct, and effective.
Looking forward to the other modules.
This lecture just gave some fundamental ideals rather than details.
That's my opinion.
There were generally two sets of challenges with each assignment exercise (1) undemanding the scala/big-data component, and (2) understand what's being asked.
't hurt it!
I liked this course, but there is room for improvement.
For the assignment where you list keywords and hashtags associated with your target audience using Social Mention, the keyword results are only as good as the search term you use.
A bit too basic at the beginning.
I liked the testimonial videos.
The lectures should be longer and more detailed.
One assignment problem focusing on one algorithm, while having other challenging algorithms taught in those videos to be left for our own implementation would help students a lot more i believe.
Unfortunately assignments are trivial and boring.
Good..
Also this course was on Python 2, so try to identify the differences between 2 and 3.
In general it's really fun here but the assignments takes much more time than told and i wishedthe focus would be more on layouting interfaces.
Quality and content are lacking.
Loved the course, would take a continuation if available.
Nice but I completed 2nd week before last date...
but then also it gave as overdue..
If you are a white man and want to learn how to influence other white men, this is a great course.
Worth to mention that in contrast to the first 3 courses in Scala specialisation this one is very heavy on visual aspect.
Missing interactivity which is very important to retain the understanding of the concepts explained.
thank you
The course is not really about Functional Programming, but more about Scala in general.
Could be less generic!
I hated the course ....
I almost gave this two stars, but the content of the course is excellent, and I didn't want to take away from that.
This is a good, general introduction.
I understand that many people want to quickly jumping on the topic, but there should be a minimum set of prerequisites before starting this class.
I do hope the following series will eventually tackle these issues, and I'll be glad to give the whole series 5 stars.
Compared to the previous 2 courses, this one seemed to have been made in rush.
Pretty decent breakdown of Bootstrap, but execution can be poor with the assignments.
I found the assignments frustrating and spent much of my time trying to understand what they were asking rather than actually solving the problems.
Overall the course was good, but the quiz assignments need work.
I thought that they could have gone more in depth in terms of metrics, how to calculate them, and use them in real life situations.
A motivated student can run through it very, very quickly.
Read Genetics for Dummies and reviewed my old textbooks to refresh on topics I found interesting and this was a nice course to accompany that endeavor.
I understand that it's important to know and get familiar with the tools but in my case I already use hootsuite to share and analyse my content.
There was also limited ability to work with the course components, such as lecture transcripts.
What should I search for to find out what they are talking about?
I thought the course was good although some of the material a bit basic but it definitely will help with my teaching.
the lecture notes is a bit confusing
The last week assignment is easier and no strict rules to achieve.
The glossary cheatsheets delivered on this best - but the videos I found to have simple, tired repeated perspective.
Unfortunately the lectures on Futures seemed a bit disconnected from the rest of the material...
The videos are too long, without quizzes or activities to break the long dry monologues.
I tried following the instructions but I couldn't find some things so it confused me a bit.
Is it really any more than simple openness to new ideas and the possibility of being wrong.
But the teacher (Bless his heart for meaning well) ended up being rather annoying and distracting with his constant antics.
Finally, the end of lesson tests always have one or two challenging questions which is great.
Unfortunately , for me it wasn´t very exciting or motivating and perhaps that is because of my own interests.
The Professors and the lectures were excellent.
Provide a video of what the final project should do in general to make it even clearer.
Overall I didn't have a bad experience with the course, just disappointed that it was really bear bones, there were too few opportunities to prove your understanding, it was poorly managed and the lack of interaction from the lecturers a massive problem when they are being paid to help out, not just provide videos and forget about the students.
There is no explanation on how the methods work.
Without the essential basic foundational mixture how is it possible to engage newcomers enough for them to determine when they will then feel equipped to attempt a final project?
Quite easy for me
I would have appreciated practicing more
If I had the right sales approach, then I would have been super successful already.
This course contained good information and it was discussed in a clear and easily understandable fashion.
Week 1 on Technical SEO was hard.
These components were not clear.
The course provides a good description of the different types of Machine Learning algorithms.
Good information, a bit basic though.
It's still a worthwhile course as is, but a tougher sell than earlier courses in this sequence.
It has not enough content, you can just read the chapters 5 to 7 of PMBOK, and its the textbook that you'll use in this course.
They were really motivating and inspiring!
Many intersections such as, socio-economic factors, race, geography, or access issues are not addressed which heavily impact this community and possible families that are disenfranchised by these disparities.
If you are not a software engineer and don't know what things like github are, this class could be useful.
You'll need to spend a long time working on them, probably attempt multiple times, and definitely visit the fora to consult with others.• Lack of assignments or already-solved exercises, similar to the ones used on the tests.
Good introduction to Finance and Accounting concepts for those with no background in either field, even as students.
Good course I liked it.
It's OK, I think there's a few areas that could use some more depth of explanation.
I find this course very informative, but at the same time the videos seem pointless.
Though it covers all the needed information it lacks of interesting content.
Strategic implementation, something that people generally forget about after creating their "marvellous" strategies and then watch them fail.
While I love challenges and learning otherwise I wouldn't have taken this course.
Thus, for me felt more like a mechanical copying of what the instructors did rather than an actual assessment of what I understood.
Just good to catch the basics.
The video volume was very quite.
This course is a pretty good resource for full-time graduates who are doing research in Natural Language Processing, but not for other people who want to learn in part-time some concrete skills to resolve specific text mining problems.
The course-style is heuristic-guiding based.
The problem sets are great and probably worth the price, but the lectures become very hard to follow after week 3 and the discussion forums are very disorganized - it's hard to find useful information.
This was a really good course.
If googling was the only option, then I do not see a value in this course.
I doubt if I will continue the other courses in this specialization.
Thanks!
I am finding it very difficult to follow, feel like I am missing a chunk of information.
Sorry to say but among the four courses of this specialization, this one really disappointed me.
Way too expensive for its contents
All in all I liked the course, it's easy to comprehend and well structured.
A lot of the practical materials in the courses are taught by the TAs, most of whom tend to speak in a monotonous manner and failed to teach at a pace that matches the difficulties or complexity of the content.
The course is self-paced though so you are relying on your fellow learners being up to the point you are for peer assessment.
As an optimization proposal I suggest to cover the resources of week one, like terms and formulas.
A few assignment questions were also poorly formulated.
All the quizzes are on the suggested reading material.
Programming instructions were not clear, and the version of Python that was installed on my machine did not support the Jupy
Unlike the previous courses within this Digital Marketing Specialization, this one seemed more "superficial" in terms of concepts and, specially, of materials provided: presentation videos and slides covered only the essential topics and were often repetitive.
I get that hydrology is Nick's field but some us will work with cities, or population, or roads, planning farmlands - a bit of variety would be nice.
The data should not be available off the Coursera page - we should have to get it off the internet so we get familiar with public data resources.
This course also has lots of issues with its quizzes; getting no support from staff on technical matters or feed back on why a true or false questions is always wrong.
Maybe there should be more in the "suggested readings" so people with the interest could add to their knowledge.
He also seems to want to intentionally make SQL look like its very simple and avoids giving interesting facts which he thinks may complicate the content but would be good to know anyway.
I would love to eat more deer, though.
This course did not live up to its potential.
The course should be retitled as an "Intro to Statistics" not learning functions and visualizations on excel.
I still have three stars because I at least picked up some useful concepts from it.
However, there was good advice that still makes it a worthwhile course.
However, the lectures could be better explained and the material better organized.
Not as thorough as Analytics Edge or Machine Learning (by Andrew Ng).
Having a lecturer standing in front of a brick wall, plugging his book and not really connecting with online students was not great.
In a way it was a good learning experience to have to complete the assignments without much hand-holding from the instructors.
In the CS201, the concept of inheritance is not introduced yet.
Plus it's annoying to have to re-do work that you could have done right the first time but the guidelines were unclear.
Completed in a week
If you want to know how to do such things, then this would be a 5-star course for you.
There is a strong emphasis in accounting rather than modelling, which was not what I was looking for.
In my opinion, this class is great for a general public, but it is not an university level course.
After all the course represents a very one sided an biased narrative which is presented to a global audience of students.
Exercises should be more tough so that students can read a lot on the web about different thingsthey could do with Javascript.
Lectures are very confusing.
As I`d love to know which things I did correct or which words I could use instead.
It should show more how to implement the skills learned in real life.
Therefore, information concerning learning process somehow too much basic, but at the same time can be quite useful if you are not aware of all these facts.
I gained greater knowledge of important political and literary figures, such as Solon and Alcibiades, than I did when I studied the subject back in college.
Found the assignments were 'very loosely' aligned with the lecture material and had poorly formed problems in places.
Lectures were reasonably good but not quite up to the standard set with other U of W Data Science courses or other University Data Science / Machine Learning courses I have taken.
I had to re-watch the first videos to recall things for the remaining quizzes).
If you don't have some sort of statistical knowledge (or inherent aptitude), be prepared to work four times longer on the course.
As someone new to the field of molecular genetics, I took the course to learn about the seminal work.
It could be better if there were more working/practice examples, but it lays down a good overview of the techniques and decision making process.
This course has help me a lot
The issues at hand are however still valid, though
Longer than it should be
Things like Basic SQL queries, Database Normalization, Conceptual and Logical databases, and making ER diagrams are covered in the course.
Cons: Prof Mannino is a bit robotic in his reading out of long sentences and the constant pace of talking.
While I definitely learned a lot during that process, it would have been really helpful to have more active instructor engagement and feedback (although I realize that this may not be possible when an official course session is not in progress, which is when the bulk of my work for this course took place).
I also think many of the problem statements could have been more clearly defined.
A good introduction to Python, but the course is a rather short & I think more could have been said about genomics-specific functions, modules, etc.
Very, very, very nice.
But for 80$ I've expected more.
A good introduction to python and data science.
The materials covered are not enough to fully explore the topics.
Also, since some of the applications are actually repeated at the beginning of the main courses, it feels like a repetition somehow when then you move to the specialized courses.
However the act of subscribing to a MOOC alone does not make people suited to review other peoples work...
but there is some great advice in here, and I would encourage everyone to take the course.
I had very little background in Economics but managed to grasp them rather easily.
Overall, this is a good course.
Specially when it comes to a course with so much geographical content, it would be good to have a more consistent depiction of maps.
Sound recording is sometimes also perfectible (echo due to large museum room).
One may also take into consideration that the perspective given in the course is a bit "Australian-centric".
BUT, the feedback from the automatic grading really lets it down.
The auto grading tests are at too high a granularity, each test tests too many things.
Just be sure to do your own research to supplement the data and be sure you're current.
After grading assignments by other students, it was easy to see why the discussion portions of the class were flat: most either didn't invest in the assignments or didn't understand the materials.
It makes me wonder who funded this course.
Reasonable, but slow to come to the essence.
However, don't expect much depth in the classes.
So I doubt the structural design of the program is sensible, or the expected solution would actually be done in real applications.
It needs a bit of work on expanding the course and presenting a bit more slowly.
The only way I was able to finish this was because I worked 8+ hours each day and late night, and all weekends trying to make sure I finish by the end deadline (the last thing I wanted was this being monkey on my back for the next few more weeks).
The positive is that I learned about BlueMix offerings and lastly I can play around now with the Raspberry Pi and do some real IoT and less Java scripting.
The course was helpful in presenting typical problems in data science, but the lectures showed you examples in one area of pandas and the assignments asked questions in different areas of pandas.
A lack of introduction to electronic circuits also hinders full use of what is being taught.
However, it is very simple for who has never experienced economics subjects.
Personally not a big fan of Roger Peng's approach while teaching.
Good to follow by the subs
It was a short and good course.
If you've completed the first course in this specialization, then this is a repeat of a lot of the same information.
I also think the assignments can be improved, some assignments lack documentation, one of them had a coordinate system swapped from what was shown on screen and the evaluation of some assignments are quite tight, even if you have it working, unless you deliver exactly as it is expected you will fail, not to mention what is expected is sometimes blurry.
UPDATE: The wording is a significant challenge, even when advancing into the more complex topics.
The course is interesting and its staff makes a great team, but I think as an introduction course, it should focus on the History of Philosophy, without entering into very specific fields of Modern Philosophy.
Revise the video too.
The videos are poorly done, and it's hard to follow with practicing in a Playground at the same time.
The stage is set well, and there are practical implementations.
It feels like if either she reads the notes or do not understand the material.
For example, in other courses in the specialization, there will be links to optional readings or videos, leading to a deeper understanding of the concepts.
The information was quite was good, but the practice and assignments were too easy.
For example, week 4 and 5 feel like they have been made separately and about the same subject, but week 5 goes further.
I also missed lectures on qPCR, NGS and other molecular methods for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes, as these methods are up and coming.
:-)
To start off, for an introductory class, this covers a large amount and variety of material.
A little bit to basic and some informations are useless beause they are part of the common knowledge.
Great course, maybe with one more week they can cover another js data types or even jquery lib
Love the lessons so far!
still needs a better way of explaining the diversity of the course
This wouldn't be an issue except that your second draft may not get graded if all of the students are done grading.
The videos are awkwardly delivered and the analogies are a bit contrived.
Overall, a good primer before moving onto other courses, as it could plant a few new ideas that will be valuable.
needs weekly code testsneeds more quiz questionsneeds more usage samples - e.
g.
Some of it will be useful going forward, if I can remember it all!However, it's almost too much information for one course, I think it should be 2-3 courses.
Good to build python basic data the concept clear
Very good information with a fantastic understanding of the variety of artists.
I was hoping for more advanced things, to learn a bit more and for less ads during these lessons.
Is it still relevant?
There needed to be a lot more thorough instruction in order to do this problem in a reasonable time.
This is an enormous gap.
I did enjoy the assignments ( observation and interview processes) and found the application helped better understand the theory.
Good and clear content.
Quality information and an enjoyable course.
The lessons needed to be more structured and not so ad-hoc.
The content was also a bit scattered.
This is a an important topic and more scientists (and students in the sciences) should learn about this but the quizzes are not great as a learning aid and my motivation is running through lows.
Exercises could be more complete, and some are outdated for latest R, giving slightly different results.
Very US-centered
I have not received yet my certificated and I can't see it in the list.
Good and basic understanding of terms.
Can be made vast.
Indeed the course gives some info on the social background of doping, on how it is fought and it is adopted.
Still a good course though!
I expected a little more from this.
It gets 3 stars only because I learned new things in the class.
Useful steps for starting the specialisation, but should this really be a course that people are paying for?
When you compare this course to others available on Coursera, such as UVA Darden's Design Thinking or University of Maryland courses on Entrepreneurship, this course does not have the same level of information, nor was the same care put into completing the course materials.
After Week 3 however, I found that the level of difficulty increased steeply and not enough assistance was provided in the lessons to get through the course at a reasonable pace.
A good course for people who are trying to lean the basics of cyber security.
Regards,Kashif
One who completes the course has to remember each points when designing a website and also implementing.
This was a four star course and the links to additional information were a good resource.
I would have liked shorter presentations with more concrete examples.
Design of the presentations could be improved as well.
Different, fun approach.
But you cannot finish your courses completely if you cannot access the quiz.
to finish his sentences.
i would like to see some subtitles in Spanish, to help me understand much better the main idea !
The presentation is such that it is very difficult to stay focused.
The course was tough and was explained in a very fast way assuming that the student knows prior statistics.
Too simple, too easy
This may be because the subject is not something I have even thought about.
Same as the theory class not much examples or case studies....
It's very straightforward.
Previous courses in both specialization - digital marketing and improving videos have at least 1.5 to 3 hours of video materials.
an easy course, i would reccomend it to novices to nutritional science.
But definitely very innovative and informative
You learn programming best from doing projects.
This course is okay, kind of a bit slow-paced.
hard to follow.
Lot of talking, lack of visual, templates, etc.
This course requires you to do a lot of self study and research on every single topic.
(Note: In the class overview, it is noted that the term "Lesser Vehicle" is "perjorative" but they use it anyway.
However it was still helpful and i enjoyed it .
A bit too theoritical
Too much information loaded.
That being said, the instructor did mention at the very beginning which aspects would be skipped and which would be covered, and those covered were covered very well, with the possible caveat that the instructor tended to teach as standard methods that were her preference or background.
Along with that, it could have addressed topics other than emotions (or been titled The Positive Psychology of Emotions), like character strengths, flow, or institution change.
Contents are excellent.
The only disappointing is that It costs to submit assignments.
language accent difficult to fallow
At times, it feels like grading parameters and questions are just loosely coupled.
On a more personal level, I found that the deadline at the end of the same week of the lectures does not allow for a lot of time to ponder and digest the information.
It also seems to put a bit too much emphasis on Abstinence.
The course is best suited for an Intermediate student.
when talking about the maths behind AR)
The course has provided the insights into what is machine learning and how machine learning algorithms works.
I wish it was more practical and that gave some real explanations (not just "this concept is called like this... because it is called like this").
The material is clear and the overview is nice, but the practical part let me down.
I would rather learn more practical knowledge.
There are some concepts made me confused and I want to discuss with some other classmates.
There is a high disparity between lecture content and the knowledge required to complete the assignments.
Slides were informative, but the lecturer did not add anything to them.
I'm in the data science specialization.
I know that I am not alone in this experience, as these types of comments come up frequently in the forum posts.
More about drugs available in the markets and new trends.
Psychotherapy applications / demonstrations would be very useful.
Sound is very low and noisy in some videos which makes it hard to watch on a mobile device.
I felt myself re-watching the videos to try and understand the content because there were many instances where the professors' spoke about some fundamental aspect of data science but failed to provide some real world context.
This did not grab my attention like I thought it would.
Good information and advice.
Decent for a start.
I seem to understand the theory behind it but I am not sure how valuable it will be for me.
Personally, though, I would have liked it better if the lectures were more focused on the material.
It's a difficult course with some hard topics on neurophysiology for people with no background on biology.
Good coverage of bootstrap, but the other parts were very briefly touched upon (nodejs, bower etc.)
I mean, because the instructor only speaks moving hands from one side to other, it was very difficult to visualize what and where the instructor was referencing to.
But I needed something a little more tangible with which to get started .
This course teach you how important is to have philosophical mind.
The overview of what philosophy is in the first lecture is awesome.
Though neuroscience part is presented brilliantly and makes it totally worth.
answer = 0.0073.........64 without actually giving the full answer.
I learned a lot about the course but it would have been better if the instructor would have given some emphasis on programming with Unix machines like Macs.
So overly simple with a lack of details in the steps.
This module took me on an interesting journey with lots of twists and turns.
I would not mind the rapid pace if the materials presented were also the ones tested.
The steepness of the learning curve increased very quickly and understandability decreased after week 3, which made me drop the course.
Interesting but basic course.
I was expecting more practice doing computation or examining case studies.
It is ok, and not as good as the marketing class from warton
The quality of the course is not as I expected from a Coursera course.
The course was good, but what disappointed me was that the assignments were more focused on java script and less IoT.
Some parts were good but overall the course was lacking in its ability to add value.
It's also too academic and should focus more on how to build real websites.
On the bright side, it does give you some basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Too high level course.
But the course didn't fully exploit the possibilities of the web and I felt it was very static.
It took me about four hours to complete the entire course (minus the peer reviewed assignment since I audited).
Overall, it's a good introduction and overview to material science.
They ask to many questions with multiple answers and the online student is expected to know so much more materials that is probably taught in the actual class, and does not have access to.
I gained a lot from this course, but perhaps not as much as expected even considering it is a fundamentals course.
Cannot participate in graded work unless purchased.
I had one response from another student which did not actually address the issue of my question and I had several views.
Give more room to use in examples, create action, tell stories.
BR
Most interesting topic, previously unknown.
Some parts were merged with other and the whole thing lacks continuity.
The course is interesting, and packed with some easy to understand, easy to apply techniques.
I still do not have a grade on this assignment and fear I will fail the class.
The reason I bring this up in my review is that there is no contact information for the instructor.
!Anyway it's worth your time.
What I like about the course is that it is given by graduate students.
But it's definitely for people with solid JS and CSS bases.
)What I like: presenting of current software projects around big data
Course was good, but the material covered was at a fairly high level and done too quickly.
This is the internet, not a published textbook.
The topics are really interesting and advanced!
However, I think it emphasizes too much the lattice and basic plot systems to the point it is redundant with functionality on ggplot.
Since scripting is such a huge part of game development, I feel like there should have been more focus on it.
Unfortunatelly, last week had a very low quality - it was the only part I wasn't able to take out anything.
This is a good introductory course, however the quiz questions and over dependence of graphlab are off putting.
thanks..
There tends to be many lectures that are just lists of commands.
It gives overview on what is going to be learned in details in the next courses.
The first three were relatively ok, considering I'm new at this but they did take me longer than 3 hours to complete.
See Brando Skyhorse course, very structured.
This is also not helpful for explaining the material.
Assignements are easier than previous
Though some of the theoretical stuff that is covered is sort of common sense, most is still very relevant, so I don't regret taking the course.
There are ratios and balance sheet jargon just flying at you at a breathless pace.
It's good for people who are beginners in cooking.
Week 3 has pretty much no examples at all.- Suppplementary material and notes are uneven from week to week.
On the other hand, it's a great challenge for everyone interested on brain decision making.
They also talk like robots and one gets lost really fast.
So while the videos are great, the actual teacher involvement is poor.
Coursera - I am not sure how you and the university work together, but is it totally strange to desire some input from your professor?
that's very good, but it could be better if there is a way to pay and get certificate.
Good course, I enjoyed learning chemistry!
Nice course, but a little "light" at times.
What's great though is that there are no deadlines, which really enabled learning at my own pace whenever I had free time :)
Everyone could rate two or three reviews.
If you are doing other Coursera courses and/or working at the same time, I recommend you invest time in this and do not let the assignments for the weekends.
The quality of the material makes up for it, to some extent - but there needs to be more Coursera support (I think) to get the errors in quizzes and stuff sorted out.
There is only one video talking about HMM models, and Markov Chains deserve at least one week to even get started with it.
The exemples are a little bit abstract, not much hands on or practical.
This course leaves you frustrated, as valuable information is only ad the end and at the beginning.
Also, the audio quality is not that great.
For example, Benford's Law.
The rest of it is a preview of the other courses in the series.
While the information given by Fran was useful, the part where other artists talk is not presented well.
Could have made more definitive statements on the usefulness of each test (there was lots of 'you could have a look at this analysis, or this one, or this one' without covering why each one would be particularly good for this case).
would of liked to see more programming examples in the lectures.
Some of the reading seemed rather hard going and academic and theoretical, but the course was good as an intro to issues related to public policy, getting to know the keywords used, and showing the systemic shifts in cities over the last 2 decades towards a more multi stakeholder approach for a more decarbonated economy.
too short and simple
This would have made it easier to relate theory (of this course) with (actual) practice.
Many students find it very enjoyable.
Course is good but the assignment are too basic.
The bibliography consists of encyclopedia's articles which are not necessarily written to a beginner.
Good for anyone new to HTML
I thought it was friendly enough to be appropriate for this kind of intro class, and I really enjoy iPython notebooks for interactive teaching.
I rated this course a 3 because of the price for the full course.
I had problems with lots of small inconsistencies in notations...
I prefer courses which are mathematically more precise, and develop the material more systematically.
I acquired some very specific and useful skills, which I developed by completing projects on topics of my choosing that were meaningful to me.
I felt I wasn't learning anything new but the clips of films allowed me to see the films in a new light.
However, the final assignment is quite difficult to complete for students with no access to data on companies and industries.
But some videos and case studies were dissapointing in terms of uniqueness of information.
Somewhat basic and not very applicable
Following are the scope of improvement -1) The flash lessons could have been provided in some kind of downloadable format (preferably PDF)2) Actual examples of Project Charter and Project Management Plan could have been provided.
When should I use a factory?
Instead I'll need to search the internet for an answer and hope what I find is correct!
It was quite hard with all the statistical jargon.
Sometimes you need more time to go through the documentation of a graphic library that you will never use again than in doing the actual assignment's core thing.
Either way, I believe all the MOOCs are fantastic and necessary.
The course is ok, but it doesn't give any certificate of completition for free users (something that many other course do give).
I believe there is important to have access to the comments of our peers, I've receive some bad grades and I don't know why.
However one of the lecturer's had such a heavy accent I had to use subtitles just to understand the content.
However, it was a nice course I certainly learnt something that would really help my job.
There is no process to dispute the grade.
The instructor was going too fast.
Peer reviewing is not sufficient for grading a Capstone Project.
As a basic statistic course, the correctness of the estimation/ calculation/ assumptions is integral in any analysis but the grading criteria mostly neglect all this aspect.
I resent being duped into watching ads when I've signed up to be educated.
The other thing that bothered me was the course required us to divulge a lot of personal information to other students in pointless, time-consuming projects.
This course in informative, but not very, and it is rather boring.
It was a bit.... general.
Mostly talking heads.
This Course is very Good For Children.
This was done professionally without a doubt.
As such, when it comes deep down to these, I didn't really enjoyed the course as much as I thought I'd.
such as, contrastive divergence (CD1) algorithm to train Restricted Bolazamann Machine (read wikipedia to get it in under 2 mins), functioning of sigmoid belief net etc.
The quizzes and assignments don't necessarily correlate well with the lessons, and the assignments are structured poorly.
But I suppose it has no great impact on my lifestyle, as I have enough activity already.
Lectures are great.
A lot of background information, most of which I was unfamiliar with.
I thought the course was illuminating and a great start to the specialization.
It does cover some new developments and provides good examples, but otherwise quite boring and standard fare.
One of the lecturers hesitates and stutters a lot.
As for the final assignment.
It is distracting.
Covers the basics
Good experience of using the big data tools but a total lack of engagement in the forums by the instructors and community mentors make it hard going if anything goes wrong.
It was hard to take notes, the conversation from the instructors was to casual.
But, for those who want to explore further please recommend sources of additional reading and research.
The "but" I found is : first, the required readings are very extensive, and second , the questions for the quizes are most of them too much specific, and there are so many photographers names that it is quite a challenge to have more than five questions right.
Lectures are very easy and unnecessarily long and slow.
Course is mostly theoretical.
Depending on the customer's level of experience in construction.
A good, general overview definitively worth working on.
Easy to follow and understand.
Actually interesting..
Content is good, less well polished than Odersky's courses though.
Awesome course!
I also wish that the course covered more on how to avoid being "shelved" by a label or management company.
It could be a great course in futureAlso, sometimes it's confusing like you are asked to download code and write it along with the video but the files already (at least partially) contain the code that you should write and it looks quite different from the video.
There could also be more focus on what is important rather than unnecessary etymologies and listing of names which doesn't add to any conceptual understanding.
Because of this the text output is EXTREMELY verbose, making it impossible to read the error messages and understand them.
Course and assignments were very easy.
An interesting class but left me wanting more.
Especially for a course designed for a global audience.
This is strictly for beginners.
CDN topic was very good and well explained.
The topics are great, the material is not really polished: the lectures are from previous courses and they reorganised material without redoing anything, which is needed in several points.
The first couple Python program demos has my head completely spinning, and I think this could be largely avoided by having a couple more slides piecing together the logic of the programs.
So, 5 stars for the content, 0 stars for the autograder, 3 stars as a final mark.
If you have any coding experience in other languages, this will be extremely simple.
The project was also very informative.
The Bad:- The video need to better explain how Area Under Curve and how the Credit model make sense.
This is a great introductory course for the Health of Transgendered youths.
It would be good for people with zero experience with ML, who might be overwhelmed by other ML courses (Ng, Abu-Mostafa) out there.
emphasis on good standards.
not enough in-depth analysis or practices.
Just reading the slides isn't always helpful.
The course provides a concise overview of the disorder and suggests some strategies to cope with it at home and in school.
I did learn, and that is great.
The last week, concerning how to resist attempts to manipulate you, was probably the most important.
So when will we learn that just because something happens on this planet doesn't mean it will, has happened elsewhere.
For experienced folks -- probably a good number since this is an Executive Data Science course -- it was pretty basic.
Also, it would be good to have weekly assignments, to stay on track.
A nice introductory course.
However, I found the latter half of the course too skewed towards the USA.
Given the great reviews I expected a lot more from this course.
Plus -- no certificate dings it one more for me...
This course was very good and very interesting.
Also, you are expected to review 3 other projects.
But and this seems to run across the whole specialisation, support from the course team varies between very patchy and none at all.
Course content good but labs difficult to work with as no offline unit tests were provided which made debugging painful.
It really makes the assignment experience awful.
The final assignment case study was definitely useful in thinking about several of the metrics covered over the four weeks.
I found the lectures very interesting; but was surprised at how the quizzes / assignments focused so much on facts and figures - surely these aren't nearly as important as understanding the content?
Contrast this with the Happiness course for a clue as to how to make the information more interesting and compelling as far as presentation is concerned.
Think of all the students that may attend the course will more than cover the server costs if it was 10$.
I missed some in depth explanation (like the class of the nerv-system or the Glycemic index).
In addition he is reading the formula at one moment and in around 3-4 seconds it appears on the screen.
Hoping the course could have more focused exercises to make sure learners actually master the skills.
3 stars because the lecturer is really good but talks a little bit fast so foreign students cant clearly understand what he means or get "lost" in the course.
The ideas presented in the course are interesting, relevant, and impactful.
There are many things that can be improved in EU and a more critical approach would be a lot more helpful.
Very weak on modern-day best development practices, and many of the "phases" discussed are closer to the anti-pattern of Waterfall, not Agile.
The fact is that the material is extensive and often complicated, and it's imperative for me, as a student, to be correct as fast as possible.
It can be improved to make the student really think.
There should be more programing exercises.
Maths covered is very preliminary.
This is a great course due to the well designed and produced videos, peer feedback feature and structure of the course.
With that said, this course could have been a lot better than it was.
The honors programming assignments could have been excellent The material was interesting and dovetailed well with the course content.
The videos are in fact useful.
It's not professional as that one created by Penn Uni.
Easy course.
My other problem was using one of the models, which I never could master, despite reading the help sites and trying two or more times.
There were and still are some typos in tests.
Would have preferred if there were programming assignments that incorporated reading from data sources on the web.
For those planning to take the course, note the following:*The course covers reading data from a myriad of sources, but largely in passing superficial detail.
Don´t think is recommended for beginners.
Overall this course has some valuable information.
A bit old version of Meteor, but a good course for basics.
Saddly this old version and the way we done, gonna be deprecated soon.
A good course with good assignments
They could have picked something more interesting.
Multiple choice quizzes are used to grade the programming assignments, so there is no feedback from the instructors.
Also, a little more in-depth info for each topic will also be well appreciated.
Previous module was better structured.
The assignment should essentially match the rubric to ensure accuracy of grading.
Thank you again for this opportunity to take your course!
But the other two weeks on Kalman filter and Particle Localization were little disappointing.
Anyway, I expect more quality in the next course of the program "Managing people"...
I don't think this assessment method was sufficiently designed to reduce the influence of graders who were overly subjective, hadn't sufficiently mastered the content themselves, or were disinterested in putting effort into the peer review.
The lack of discussion forums makes it a fairly sterile experience.
It's not a bad course, but it forces students to use GraphLab, a framework created by one the professors teaching the course, instead of using scikit-learn, a widely used framework for machine learning in Python.
Course itself is excellent, cases are very good and practical, but the only thing is lots of technical issues with the assignments and quizzes.
Have no idea or support to solve them.
These sources include XML files, mySQL databases, HDF5 files, csv files, txt files with various formats (for example fixed-with files), JSON objects, and web API.
However, the course project only involves reading data from several txt files and combining them into a single R dataset.
Course topic order: In the first two weeks of the course, a lot of information is glossed over in passing- this information involves reading from the various file formats mentioned above.
Concepts covered in quiz and assignments are not covered well in the lecture videos, can be much better.
However I feel it is unfortunate that the lecturer did not make an effort in preparing the presentation of the material.
I really enjoyed learning more about ancient Egypt.
I didn't realize until wasting 2 weeks that there was an alternate interpretation which I could try.
In the 3rd exercise some of the comments in the code are wrong/misleading.
Would be beneficial if the course could be expanded and a formal certificate could be obtained providing credits or official points.
Reviewing these assignments, because they were so basic, made it hard to offer much in the way of constructive criticism.
There's too much discrepancy over the assignment descriptions and the tutorial discussions.
Where did THAT come from??
A good, basic introduction to Social Media Data Analytics
And that permanent fake smile and constant nodding.
I know that the title says "introduction", but I felt it was to basic...
I liked the approach of the homeworks, but I missed more reading material or more sources to explore...
also, being an introduction to game design, I think many issues froom game design were not touched.
Interesting, I would have liked to deepen SQL knowledge and practice.
Another problem with this specific course is word hunting in quizzes.
Too short, interesting but far too short
Also, there is no testing frameworks used - and this is a big missing element for modern careers in web development.
Very basic stuff!
Very basic introductory course.
Thought this course could've been much more effective.
I did not enjoy this class.
Very long assignment
Even my husband, who isn't fond of art in general, found these videos interesting.
Very educational.
Great overall material.
I think work needs to be done in order to improve the presentation of new concepts and vocabulary as well as the English of the speaker (and the corresponding caption).
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I dont think it build my knowledge until I understand how to create that script for week4.
I was not aware that she is also a Dzogchen student.
contents are too less
If starting directly from Week 1, it would be difficult to follow.
When reviewing your peers' work, the points rely on whether you've explained yourself.
What was presented was good but I felt that more could have been presented.
Legitimate questions from students about content errors or technical problems went unacknowledged.
I`m for example a french educated student, so I prefer to take courses with a teacher who talks in a comprehensive way in which I can understand everything he says in order to proceed in my work and then to benefit everything in this course.
Concerning the quiz, in the all of the quiz there is questions not related to what already said from the teacher or in the articles required to read.
It definitively could be a whole lot better, look and learn from Udacity's nanodegree.
Too abstract, too expensive.
its a good course .
However i found it difficult since it requires you to understand how the internet and internet application work
Overall, this is a good subject.
However, some slides are not well organized.
Many questions in assignment are too tricky.
I thought it could use more insight from other instructors.
the scholarly writing becomes easier after taking this course.
Have the course is very basic, while the rest is just too brief and not practical enough.
It's a good course for introducing students to html.
I prefer Cumulative tests as well because they assess everything you've learned and whether you've retained the information or not.
Otherwise, this course was a great overview of the types of models used.
Not finding it very useful, but it's good to know about the concepts and theories for each type of experiments.
The best part of the assignments consisted of being able to view classmates submissions and learn from them by reviewing the code techniques that they used.
Then added some lectures on web design that could have used information relevant to Wordpress such as image compression plugins instead of tinypng.
com (see last component).
I feel like the professor was rushing through his explanations and the models.
Too simple for what I was looking for.
It is a good course, but if you want to hand on the assignments, you have to pay.
Very Easy.
This course was significantly less instructive than the first.
reading for any PM, but it is a bit difficult to understand anything while a teacher just retranslates something, from any book — especially not written by the one — with poor examples.
One issue I had, was that the quiz questions sometimes used terminology or jargon for which the link with the material covered in the videos was not always immediately obvious.
Another piece I read was over 2000 words long and had obviously been taken from some other assignment: it barely fit the study brief.
Jack Wu is probably a heck of a developer but he's a terrible instructor.
So the general idea is not without merit.
It is more suitable for people with very little background n food science and nutrition, aiming to get some knowl on these fields.
specifically regarding I2C everything was in rush.
But I would have liked more examples.
But when we had to do the final exam (for week 2), they asked questions about "what happens if there are two commands in the brackets" (like this .
changeme .
changemeagain).
A resource if your starting with Swift.
For instance, the last three or so classes were missing, yet it was still possible to take and pass the final review.
But you'll probably need to do a bit of research yourself if you want to be ready for the exam.
Half of the first week quiz verifies knowledge that in my opinion has no practical importance (not something to remember).
The teacher speaks very fast and provides the material not deep!
the resolution of the video is not clear and also audio is not clear, but the contents are good
Mostly because some core requirements of the assignments were not explained in the lectures.
Good performance from the teach!
Not challenging at all
Plus: responsive web programming, notions of bootstrap and jQueryNegative: ultra-beginner level, very low-level basics, not much hands-on use of HTML/CSS/JS
I enjoyed and found all of the lectures helpful, but lack of feedback after submitting assignments was a real problem, especially for the last assignment.
Looks like I have to teach myself how to use different programs for designing.
I expected something a little more faced paced from Berklee.
good but supporting material are poor
Short course, so there is not much time to give challenging assignments that would prepare you for a job or industry level skill in this topic.
Nevertheless, it was a good introduction to Python.
I've been enrolled to this course for over a year already.
So easy~But the teacher is well！
It's a great introductory class, but would like more personal feedback from professionals.
There are a number of cryptic instructions that really don't need to be hidden.
Its a really a nice course.
I have a mixed feeling about it.
Some of the equations presented don't have enough explanation behind them for them to seem in context or to give any idea about how they can be applied.
I have a background in electrical engineering, and I studied control systems in undergrad, so I was able to get by.
Course material is thin and you can go through it in a couple of hours.
The emphasis on methods rather than specific tools makes the course more resistant to the continuous changes in technology.
The course is very good explained.
The course's assignments (3 so far) are not very well designed.
It takes me more time to search online and on the lecture's videos for information than to actually write and come to a solution.
Only week 4 was interesting to me, dealing with boostrapping.
The teacher is very clear and chooses the subject in a clever way.
Even though the theoretical part was well put together, case study questions were too vague and should have been better thought out.
Very technical and focuses more on cosmology than on the principles of Philosophy of Science
Many of it's "failings" may just be my karmic opinions.
Current iteration is a little rough as an online course, could use a little thought into the peer-review process works specifically around how to distribute the code.
I feel like there's so much content in this course, but I didn't really learn anything...
It's a lot of talking, ending with "go to the forums and ask your peers about all these concepts that you need to know but that I won't talk about."
Excersices!
It's short and easy.
The course should still be passable even in the absence of sufficient other projects to review, which is a problem that no student has any control over.
I was very excited during Week 1 and Week 2 lectures.
A lot of the lectures are unwatchable for me.
I would suggest to expand on Bootstrap and how to work with it.
Ended up confusing with various interviews and what are differences between various content based recommenders.
it was a interesting course
Honestly I really already knew most of the things in this course.
I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation.
Some answers can be googled but the answers vary wildly between sources.
Mathematical Thinking from Stanford is the gold standard.
Good introduction to business metrics.
I learned a lot of things related to journalism from such valuable course.
Hopefully that will improve as the course continues.
me) it was too easy (even though I had no Ruby / Rails experience).
Using the screen for just a video of the lecturer speaking seems a waste of the many video techniques that could be included, with the lecturer in a small window at the side.
Barbare is not the greatest and most charismatic speaker in the world, although she did surprise me in her TED talk.
in general, human emotions are operating on a scale from positive to negative.
Well, I expected more and more debt, It seems the course is oriented to the general public.
This course offers valuable information on the different aspects of Construction Project Managment.
Long lectures, not always relevant stories, a presentation style that did not speak to me, and a bit slow.
very short course.
I refuse to buy a webcam for Coursera (I have a phone with that capability but the Coursera app doesn't support it for identity verification), so I can't get a certification anyway.
I expected it to be far more
It was overall, alright.
Better to use file uploading with required snippet.
a bit boring
Because of this, I was unable to get the Honors status.
In the beginning it feels like a course, but from week three on it feels more like a conversation about food.
But it is not particularly useful.
I do understand that Internet-based peer review is challenging, and that you have to settle for "neutral" criteria that are easy to assess by learners.
I'm glad I took the course but it was not designed for someone at my skill level.
Course is really helpful, but definitely need an improvement.-Lot of information is Missing.-Need to be more clear in the lectures.-Similar course named iOS App Development for Entrepreneurs by UCI is constructed in much better way than this.
There was a lot of talk but no real practical application (I guess except for github for people that didn't know how to use that).
A useful overview, but I think this course tries to be too many things all at once.
I think that some of these issues have now been addressed and should not present a problem in future programs.
This course is about computational neuroscience, it is not easy, and it requires knowledge and passion of mathematics and biophysics of neurons.
I have programming experience and feel I would have found it quite a challenge otherwise, but not prohibitively so.
But behaving like a machine, I tried, but I can not.
If the week 4 was not there, i would have a 2 or even a 1 for this class.
Until week 4, there was very little connection between what we were watching and what we were asked to write assignments.
What it does do is offer a snapshot of the industry as a job outlook, discuss Google's algorithm impact on SEO practitioners, offers interviews with current SEO analysts and experts, and describes how content affects SEO.
The course content is very superficial.
The course content applies to R. The teachers focused on the programming language rather than the application of the existing graphs to explore data.
It's a small nag, but it builds up over 11 weeks.
The tasks, being extremely easy, don't really bring you further in understanding either.
The videos with professors were decent but could have been better.
While the instructor was fun...
her videos could use more graphics/powerpoints or some sort of visual instead of just straight up talking.
I would have also liked to have seen other platforms utilized.
Ex:Hypothetical situations to apply course content to.
Group assignments with real time chat.
Better formatted supplemental readings to compliment the lecture videos.
Also, I feel like the instructors failed to explain some of the business jargon used, which wasn't remedied by referencing the dictionary.
NO ESTOY DE ACUERDO CON QUE SEAN LOS ESTUDIANTES LOS QUE REVISEN EL TRABAJO FINAL DEL CURSO.
It was quite confusing with unlocking next weeks work, and the filming of the videos were poor.
still, an amazing introductory course.
Why couldn`t you make it a few smaller to every week?
It can be different to test the effectiveness of the student.
Teach us how to read alphabets and assignment is to write poetry.
Too many people have to ask for it in the forums.
In conclusion, a good course with good video material, but a lack of presence and organization.
The material was easy to follow and the instructions were precise.
Most of the courses are abstract and they do not analyze a real life case.
The course would have really benefited from .
pdf reference material, for review and elaboration of topics presented in lectures.
interesting history of neural networks and excellent coverage of all main architectures.
couple of problems during the quizzes.
A lot of reasonable questions are not answered and even not mentioned: we use Euler's angles, which lead to singularities and ambiguities, there are quaternions, but we'll not use it.
It was almost only copying and pasting code...
However, I still do not feel I could propose convincing PGMs for real-world problems.
Good contents, but lectures could be improved for clarity.
All in all, a good challenge to a content professional, but don't expect all of this to align with what you learned in the lecture series.
After my second question, I knew I was all by myself.
VERY small amount of knowledge
I am immensely relieved this course is done and I can move on to the next one in the specialization--hoping it's better organized as was the Fundamentals course that Richard Waterman taught.
Though it is a nice introduction, I would have expect a more syntax learning lessons.
Good information presented, but I can't get past the outdated teaching method of using the first 45 to 60 seconds of each video to talk about what the video is going to cover, then spending 30 seconds repeating those bullet points at the end of each video.
If it isn't possible to make sections of this book available online then you should at least rewrite some of the quiz questions so that they are accessible to students who can't get hold of a copy of the book.
She's reading each point and does not provide additional insight.
very shalow information, I would like if this course had a contination.
Some topics are run through so quickly that they are confusing to students.
I think 1 lecture should be enough.
And since is an introduction it should include an installation tutorial.
This is much more conceptual and high level, so it was less useful for me.
Some important terms may not be clear for people who live outside USA.
Update: I'm lowering my grade from 4 stars to 3 stars because of very confusing assignments.
This course has appealing assignments and covers interesting topics.
Very poor instructions and not enough theory.
But listening attentively was very difficult.
Heavy americanism impedes understanding; especially when the student does not have familiarity with US pop culture.
Good, but very very basic
I kind of feel like the course was rudderless and just gave some headlines and then said to go figure it out on your own, but be inspired by all of these extremely successful people.
I was less enthusiastic about all the investment metrics and formulas, but that might just be me.
Doing reviews wasn't fun because formally most students got enough points but content-wise I perceived it as rather messy assignments to review.
Or doing some real data analysis?
It was a fairly good course, the professor is funny and the slideshow itself is well made, but the content sometimes got boring and my mind stepped away from the course, something that did not happen even with other more difficult courses.
The amount of time that you spend on learning during the course is only a fraction of time you spend to get through the autograder.
Comments made when assessing other students' work are not anonymous - this is unique in my Coursera experience, where anonymous marking is the norm, and knowing how fractious people can get when they are disappointed with their grade, I am not at all happy about having my name made available to them.
Overall, the only reason I persisted with this course is that I wanted to get a certificate with MoMA written on it.
I found the presentation to be lacking somewhat as the course-leaders were reading off the info in front of the camera, which gave the lectures an artificial sort of feel.
Would have loved a decent explanation of a Monad and their usages, but it really felt out of place in this course (no exercises on Monads).
After completing the first two courses I don't feel like I would bother with the next ones.
Amount of AngularJS topics covered by the course is too small.
For example, you are required to upload images of 3 or 4 artworks and discuss them.
Also, I like the idea of mixing up the assignment format, but creating three movies is a lot to ask for a management course, especially when the same assignment could easily have been done in another format - it felt forced.
The material was a good refresher.
Since the course has as a prerequisite that you can already code this shouldn't be an issue for anyone.
I may not have had the proper background in mathematics to full absorb the material.
To some extent that's true, and it makes me, I think, fun to drink with.
Learning is not something that stops after graduation and I would appreciate if the authors gave some attention to those who are already done with school, but do not want to stop acquiring new knowledge.
You don't need to learn a chinese characters.
Grammar mistakes and misprints.
Not a lot of practice problems and somewhat superficial information.
It was an easy entry for HTML5, I wish it was more in depth.
The videos aren't very helpful for a beginner programmer, and the assignments are pretty challenging.
Dr. Peng is great at teaching, and the lectures are not hard to follow.
The course description should better specify this.
Each assignment boiled down to parsing a file using specific method (reg ex, Beautiful Soup, XML, or json libraries) to do the same task.
In general, seems to me that the courses of the specializations do not fit together well.
Apparently, and I don't want to put words in someone else's mouth, but the assumption is that the fellow students will have the missing information and that they will actually answer them.
- good content but lacked engagement
Learn something about the money supply and demand and their relationship with the exchange rate.
The content let's you think about starting a business in a general way also.
Not that great resource to learn from a beginning.
Good short course (knocked it out in a couple of days) for revising/learning techniques.
Dr. Chuck goes through an interesting example of going through email data and there is plenty of time to do your own project.
A great idea to create a project based online course.
The lectures are largely America centered with courses on presidential war powers, the functioning of governors.
The quizzes aren't that challenging and it may be nicer to expand the assignments to practice more.
I learned a lot but there are definitely errors in the course material and a entire missing video.
Pretty short introduction to R.
Add at least three more sessions to the class and spread the technical material out over more sessions.
In one of the videos, the professor suggested that teaching should be slightly above the student's level but not too high.
The videos were good, especially the ones involving children.
The University of Adelaide is running a similar course on a well known competitor site, so I have signed up to that.
I do not think I will use the system that was taught.
I found this course useful and appropriate in the material offered and the assessed questions as an introduction and an update in cancer biology for CPD purposes.
The course is extremely helpful and the content is good.
The Best Explanation so far :)
For the main instructor, he's speaking really slow which can make you feel bored.
If you already have some knowledge about statistics and excel, it will be a lot easier to follow the instructor's lectures, otherwise I don't feel how a beginner could really follow up on this course.
For a beginner like me its totally going over the head.
I expected little more in terms of how to structure food habits and diets
Good and straightforward content but with so very little written excercises and thus very little room for lecturer feedback - I would not pay an additional 100$ just to get rated like that (I might consider it if the price included the mentioned books though).
However, some links and information are very useful.
So you can take the course, and the following courses, without doing any of the assignments/quizzes.
Most of the example schools were elementary so it would be better if they could include some secondary schools as well.
One area that this course could improve greatly on is the assessments.
The module does feel a little thin in content, and perhaps should be combined with Exploratory Analysis.
The assignments themselves are a great approach to learning concepts (and you get to work with real data, like the Twitter data), but without good error messaging when you submit a script you pretty much end guessing where you are taking a wrong turn.
I had high hopes for this course, but it seems as though it fails on execution.
I need to have a class.
Also I've been experiencing video lag and audio stuttering while streaming the videos so there's that.
First, the assignment is not well designed.
I did enjoy the onboarding special topic section, and the quality was higher there.
Also, the video lengths were fine but the presenters need to be trained and give more engaging, lively presentations --- a bit too classroom "lecturish".
Give it a couple of decades and someone will prove it wrong.
Good, basic information on conflict resolution.
I would have like more quizzes during the lectures and the assignments to have walk through the steps more.
This class was more so tailored to those already in the work force rather than those in college, but it gave some helpful tips.
Would be better to aim either at former DS analysts aspiring to be managers or seasoned managers trying to better understand DS.
I spent more time and energy pouring over the answers to tricky quizzes and having to implement algorithms exactly as described in the lecture notes rather than really truly learning.
However, it lacks practical examples and case studies (there is only one in the last week).
The quizes and tests had trivial answers, almost all could have been answered without watching the videos.
I learnt from the exercises, mostly.
I've finished an introductory Python course from the University of Toronto, and found that course much better structured.
Also what if you do not totally agreed with the IDEA that thematic presentation of art is the way that modern art has to be presented.
Not much explanatory
Problems with vitual machine for R assigment.
The first few topics of the course were really insightful and valuable, but this trend didn't hold out for the whole course.
I think that this course could have more content.
I would have liked some more depth in the course.
Very basic intro; not the more advanced class I anticipated, based on the first in the sequence.
The pace of the videos is also slow and oddly punctuated to the point that it can be difficult to follow at times.
You need to search and read extra materials to fill some knowledge gaps.
The content of the course is very good, but the definitions and explanations are not straight forward.
In general, i think a price of $79 is too high for a MOOC class of 3 weeks duration
However, it is hard sometimes to follow the Principals/Directors teaching the course.
I had a good time learning new things which are generally not told in your academics.
Thanks to UCI for offering it.
Some graphic and own mini lecture would help to establish you as experts (not that you are not, but we would not know that from the videos), rather than mere interviewers.
You'll have to do it elsewhere (on paper, on notepad).
Maybe covering these many amount of things in such a short course is too challenging.
Difficulties streaming
Nice but demanding course.
But overall great
Instructions for this assignment are poorly written and unclear - for example, completely NOT clear you are asking us to identify a primary key versus stating there is no primary key, etc.
Good organization and lecture format, but stressfully strict rubrics on the assignments given the peer review structure.
Generally it felt to me that the complexity of the implementation is much much more than needed in relation to the complexity of the problems.
you have to let us know in the beginning of the course, that we have to pay for finish the course!!
Generally, a fair intro to key topics in "Cybersecurity and Mobility", however some of the sources are dated (and could be updated), given the fast-paced nature of the field.
It was a basic course which provided insight into basics of Big Data, Cloud and CDN technologies.
Didn't really elevate my writing.
Otherwise, very good course!
Makes it a little difficult at times.
Also, not very motivating to go through this one.
Content was great and Prof. Shiller is one of the most important economists of his generation.
The examples and starter codes caused quite some confusion, and the underlying coding principles were not made very explicit.
I did pass the course with a final grade of 94% but I don't feel confident in my coding ability at all.
All of the review I've read were that the course was great, so maybe it is me that was the problem.
Too basic, the tasks are pretty plain, course just scrapes the surface without giving any understanding of working with JS, the course "HTML,CSS and JS" by D. Rossiter provides a far better understanding.
Do take note that a lot of reference with regards to the past philosophers are introduced as well.
Guess how he graded me.
The content is good, but it's lacking articles, important bills etc..; and the quizzes aren't very hard
I miss practical exercises that can be used to prepare the quiz
I cannot say much about the content, as I`m not a native speaker and can`t really decide about the quality of the language used.
I really appreciate that we have the possibility to join online-classes but this courses made me have mixed feelings.1) I missed a proper Introduction - even tho Week 1 had a brief Introduction, I felt from the beginning like I was thrown in thr middle of a class starting somehwere2) The animated clips are quite nice, but the power point presentations were really old-fashioned.
They were just kept to test the attentiveness of the student during the lecture.
It doesn't look professional.
On quizzes, when a student is asked to select the one FALSE answer, please remove any "all of the above are TRUE" statements.
I felt that the level of content covered here would just as easily be grasped by most undergraduates in technical disciplines if it had been delivered in a more structured manner with clearer progression across models (conceptually and mathematically) and better code examples.
The course is very elementary and basic.
Excellent introduction to Informatics but I have encountered a lot of the material in professional work and reading.
The module of legal was very focus on US which does no apply to international students.
However, if you don't have much time or you are a complete beginner I would maybe try something else.
I would like to thank both Tutor
Liked this course, entertaining and challenging.
The final assignment could use a little bit of work, from a clarity standpoint.
To many text on the slides.
After 2 weeks (I think) of practice, their brains' MRI patterns exhibited almost the exact same changes.
Good information, but a little rough around the edges, possibly due to being its first time out of the gate.
I am giving "only" 3 stars because for a basic (no previous requirements) course I would expect much more additional readings.
Then again, it was an easy entry into the broader specialization.
Pros: Information is perfect for anyone looking at Business Intelligence as a career field, or already in the career field itself.
Good use of figures and graphs.
I won't continue with the rest of the course because of that.
I actually liked the Dato libraries a lot, but I'd be uncomfortable using proprietary software for research.
Although a neat idea, I was a little disappointing to find that over the course of 4 weeks we'd only be creating and adding to a small paper game.
Many other courses allow you to take quizzes and do projects whitout paying
Informative summary of smartphone development and pertinent technologies
For a paid course, I expect some real professional help.
Many a times, I had to turn to google to help me out if I was stuck at a problem or didnt understand a concept.
Also, grades are usually late.
Only for introduction, more materials shoulb be supplied.
The course feels too rushed/condensed for someone with no real scripting/coding background.
Good, but I expected more...
There were materials online about it but none of them was helpful for this this course's project.
It was also a bit confusing to follow some sequence.
Anyhow, if you want to learn about India, it is a good course.
Bad quizzes but lectures informative.
Brian Caffo is a brilliant mind.
Also, some concepts are mentioned but not explained.
good overview of ARAF
The participation rate was low and the iOS app was so buggy I deleted it.
Second, the length of the lessons are not conducive to learning, it needs to be trimmed to shorter lessons or even be cut.
Presented very clearly and the discussions and material were interesting.
For me, that made it harder to recall the information effectively.
In my opinion, the optimal solution for the course would be to create a separate, longer course in PC and stats and require knowledge of the two for taking Data Science Specialization.
The course provides a very thorough introduction on the basic models and mechanisms by which various financial products are priced.
but it had some good material as well.
It's a good course by the standards of when it was made which, going by the overview, looks like 2014. the lectures are based on eclipse while the video teaches how to install android studio.
The course was very useful with what knowledge it provides.
Something is missing and I can't pinpoint what.
Lessons are too compact and some of the videos too long and full of content, so it's hard to process all the information at once.
Some of the lecturers were just reading down the notes wer already see in front of us and were not finishing their sentences in an engaging way (sometimes they made comments in a very low tone) .
Even do the Research subject was very interesting, this capstone was a total disappointment.
The Capstone did not offer very much support and the final review was performed for peers without previous knowledge and experience, receiving peer's complaints due to the fact that many got bad grading.
Also, many peers complaint about the image of the Specialization Certificate for not being designed professionally and many felt that they petitions where overlook.
In truth, I typically read through the transcripts instead of watching them.
With not much more effort more material could be covered.
Should've been 2X as many lectures and assignments at least.
Doing the review in the fourth week did not do justice for my peers.
The name should change to how to create a website with Wordpress.
Material was very good and well structured.
I think that one main issue is the assignment.
For the eager student maybe some more resources should have been shared.
Isee that I need to review it more carefully later on.
Focuses on pronunciation and basic pinyin.
It is a very interesting course.
On the plus side I was able to switch to another session of the class while keeping all of my progress so hopefully my assignments will get graded this time around and I'll be able to complete the class.
To be expected, but still I would have liked some more day-to-day aspects coming up.
After each lecture I'm forced to Google search a lot of what was mentioned before I even understood half of what the instructor was talking about.
The course is definitely has some value.
If you are already familiar with ML you won't learn anything new.
Presentation slides could've been better prepared.
That shouldn´t be the goal of the course, I expected the lessons to give enough knowledge to fullfil the questions of the exams
The staff of this course is really nice, that's the best part of it.
Solid introduction.
The effort put for explanation by Dr. Fowler is extraordinary.
open.
While the course does cover the material, it uses non-standard mathematical notation.
The course contains some interesting insights on writing a scientific paper.
Based on the requirements of companies hiring data and business analysts the expectation for anybody who wants to work in this field is in at least one or more programming languages.
And I can heartily recommend it.
The lecture videos are extremely monotonic!
Overall a good course, with a section on Islam and Magic that felt very well elaborated.
Little basic but with enough info.
I was not too fond of some of the comments/thoughts presented (ie.
I'm looking forward to the next advanced courses
Too reliant on materials directly collected by professor, too little context of larger artistic community.
Great subjects and some great teachers.
Also, I believe the quizzes were a bit too simple, there should have been more multiple choice answers to chose from, more questions in general, and even some pronunciation practice.
The material is all there, but it feels like a laundry list of miscellany that didn't make it into the previous or next course in the specialisation.
Although I enjoyed week 2 and 3 (would give 5 stars), and walk away with relevant information that I can implement in my work, I found week 1 and week 4 difficult to get through.
Equations were a bit difficult to understand.
If not for a lot of problems faced during software installations(which is still not resolved), would have given 5 stars
But the sound is too silent.
It's a nice course to review good work habits, but it mostly states the obvious.
Given the short timeline to finish the work, too, many of these requests need more time (e.
g.
not actually much useful course, but still provide some interesting information
More content can be put in.
There is random number used, and you have to do magic with your algorithm in order to match expected output.
I chose the "Data Mining" specialization to learn more about data mining ;-)I'm not so interested to present data
The instructor is really makes the topic boring.
I think the staff should create some automated review for what is objective: does the code compile?
I don't think people would ever remember or use them correctly.
Sure, we had lectures explaining things, but in the end we mostly had to copy-and-paste code and confirm that it worked.
Ambiguous assignments led to cumbersome completion.
Sometimes they are too long.
to simple, not sure enough practice to be good at python
In my opinion, the final exam was weak since it was compacting the quizzes throughout the course.
Too much theory and projects didn't related with real life problems.
That is good, as the PMBOK worth (must?)
Good course anyway.
I went on to study the CISSP manual and some additional training.
The professor is excellent and presentation materials are very good.
Please put more content.
Bit tough and the professor's were rushing through the course in videos.
Good course with well explained topics.
The professor goes to a great deal of effort to make what otherwise might be a dry material engaging; but I sometimes felt like I was watching one of those science programs for children where they sell how great science with fun graphics.
Currently, the certificate won't assist me; I simply wanted to learn more about ASD so as to be more informed.
This course has a good starting point, but there are so many things that ended up being wrong that I just can't force myself to give it more than 3 stars (and I'm not sure if it should be 3 or 2 stars).
on topcis like database design, data structures, etc.
the lectures are pretty great, engaging.
If looking only at what is being taught in this course, it's quite good.
Just like the other courses in this specialization, it has more than a few kinks that still need to be worked out.
The course content is quite good, though it could have been deeper in some areas.
But its peer review system is not working well, if at all.
Regards, An Le.
The course, as intended probably, is theoretical and gives a good snapshot of project management.
Way too basic.
A bit more realistic and complex practice assignments will enrich the course.
I also would have liked to see topics added to the course such as propensity score matching.
However, I didn't liked "Accordingly to Microsoft" question and material.
But absolutely no support from 'teachers'.
Instead of this course, I would much more recommend following "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" by Yaakov Chaikin from John Hopkins university, it taught me good foundations + tricks and good practices for professional web front end developers.
)I plan to make a document that follows the course module and fill in the missing piece of contextual information, derivations and concepts.
I enjoyed watching the his videos.
The TAs were very active in the forums and helped clarify/fix any problems that came up.
I think my expectation was to learn more about imagemaking in a digital sense, but I'm still happy overall that I took this course and I can't wait to earn my specialization.
Also, the instructor has no idea what "intuition" means, but uses it incessantly.
The video lectures are high quality and there are a number of different people interviewed, each one giving a different opinion on blended learning.
The explanation movies are great.
This way reviewers would put in as much effort into the reviews as into their submissions, and they would also learn how to write reviews by reading other reviews and sanding examples.
This course is a decent introduction to using the python pandas data science package, but suffers from some problems.
The lectures are very brief and do not prepare you well for the assignments.
Also I didn't found the quizzes challeging.
Very well Explained.
Tried to cover basic in very systematic way.
The assignments aren't very inspiring, either, although I like how simple the first one was because it got me on my computer trying to do it the first day.
I'll give it 3 stars since it doesn't arrive at an awe inspiring conclusion or life changing experience as somebody interesting into these subject would expect.
The course should focus more on 'learning how to learn,' not how to ace a test.
Thank you very much again.
Very generous of the World Bank to put this together.
I've learnt much more about FP by reading Learn You a Haskell for Great Good by Miran Lipovača, and Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason
In a couple of cases the assignment had very little relationship with the course material from the same week.
Overall, I sincerely think this course was useful to me.
It was good insight into problem-solving in companies.
The vidio is too long.
it is better to make it short.
At all,thank you for your wonderful teaching!
Was expecting to be a bit more comprehensive.
Thank you Prof. Mathias Finger.
This course would be better as a follow up to an example workflow showing an end to end analysis.
The instructor explains so little on programming, but the assignment are tough.
It is a useful refresher, but doesn't really contain much information.
assignments are ok.
The sound doesn't turn up very loud.
Introduce more R before asking to create projects in R. Only because I know other programming language was I able to finish week 5.
Very good but slightly basic.
The instructor is knowledgeable.
I don't think calculus and Linear algebra is enough, given some topics that are spoken about in the course.
Not sure why this aspect seems to fall short in CS but for some reason it does.
I should imagine this course for many people who are either familiar with the fundamentals of programming and/or aufait with CS concepts on the whole and have already acquired the necessary basic skill set / knowledge base of programming, will find the subject and teachings rather informative and a move forward in the development of programming languages as the format in writing programs does depict a much simpler approach when compared to other languages.
Sadly, for a complete beginner to CS this, in my opinion, fails to sufficiently guide or assist newcomers in building the confidence to later embark on a project that draws on the subject topics taught thus far and to that end its a bit of a shame as it tends to dampen your enthusiasm if you are interested in the field of computer science as that lack of clarification on what aspects relate to what factors does not become clear so when faced with the daunting task of the end of module project you may find yourself non-plussed wondering which topic relates to which task in the final project?I am sure other people will be inclined to disagree with my opinion on this but this is, after all, just my opinion, after giving the subject taster a try, the end result for me, was that the teaching methods were good as they appeared more relaxed and format was offered in a far more enjoyable way of teaching/learning a subject that, I felt, attempted to invoke or entice people where an interest in CS had been sparked and was perhaps aiming to offer a route in which to build the foundations of a programming language but then by the final week it was a case of well we have thrown this information your way, its now up to you to decipher what you need to apply to the which part of the final project and is done so under the guise of problem solving.
The latter being a plausible concept I would find perhaps more applicable later on in the specialisation as you develop knowledge/skills.
Instead, it covered best practices for conducting a data analysis.
Maybe too easy... And too focused on the society more than on the brain itself.
The course was great.
IT will be more helpful for students to know what is further stored in the specialisation.
because the most important thing is to know "why".
too short and not very helpful for me, I was missing more details.
Very thorough.
Practical tests were interesting but not particularly well explained for the MapReduce shapes task, which seemed to leave a few puzzled.
Having to write some code each weak would be better than answering quizzes and doing the first lines of Swift at the end of the class.
It is good, very basic course giving the overview of the most important subjects in project management.
Interesting ideas but a bit disorganized.
Ive learning a lot with this course.
Easy to finish in one setting.
Not to offend the course instructor, but 'uhm' how can I say 'uhm', every sentence starts, stops and 'uhm, is interjected with filler words 'uh' 'um' etc.
Some of the lectures were really good while some lectures were really confusing.
Too little course material; video's too flashy (noisy) and do not discuss enough information
Introducing them in a 4-week course seems a really bad idea to me.
Certainly it did not have the rigorous content that would have been required in a college level credited class.
good courser for the beginners, right place to start, and begin where the course ends.
THANKS A LOT.
Week 3 assigment had little relationship with the material presented in the course.
Much was left to student when stuck and exasperated options.
The other thing that worried me was that most of the assignments that I peer reviewed had missed large parts of the question.
However, the topic of the course and the lectures are clear and on point.
Was also horribly misleading by stating that it was Certificate-granting when it was not, partially (not totally) fixed now but it really screwed one person I know, luckily the grade sheet seems to be sufficient proof for my purposes but if you are looking for resume material go elsewhere.
But all of what was taught was good and clear.
I liked the questions in the middle of the videos, but I would be great to always have the justification of the answers for a more profund learnning.
it is very nice course, and improve my english writting style
While the content and the curriculum of the course is ok, the course is not moderated enough in terms of answering the questions the participants have
Maybe too easy.
However I would have rather appreciated it further if we used open source python libraries rather than graphlab!I think the use of graphlab really did limit our scalability and use elsewhere other than on the course.
Please do consider using open source tools in further courses and also provide starter code for the assignments in one open source library in addition to the code provided using graphlab.
At the same time, the technical issues of some lectures give a relatively bad image of the university of Maryland...
Too sad because again, the content in most videos is great... Just reorganize it and put it together with more cohesion.
PD gains tuning is manual.
Learned a lot about herbalism.
This is a good course for pure beginner who never program before.
No processed foods.. ok but what else?
Great basic overview
Even with the correct conditions, with a previous knowledge of numerical methods you can go through it, but otherwise it takes quite some time;-the grade is not set properly.. you either take 0points or the maximum, meaning that for just passing the assignment you have the same difficulty as getting full marks.. if you arrive (after days of trial and error) to the point of passing the assignment, then you can easily get full grade with small changes.. which makes no sense;-the explanatory pdf for the assignments or the provided codes some times contain errors, and I don't understand why they are not fixed considering that this course is already the second time that was provided;-the assignments are fully based on matlab and to actually understand something it is required quite a deep knowledge of how to use it..
The first half of the course was great but 2nd half was a bit disappointing.
I found the Week 3 programming assignment to be tor easy and, frankly, not very valuable as a learning tool.
Simple and good overview of Data Science
It isn't really what i expected.
The material covered in the course is adequate and relevant to various aspects to our social lives.
Among my registered courses in the specialization this course is the one that should be invested with more effort from creators in order to give students more practical lessons.
This was the topic I was most excited to get to in the specialization, so I started playing around with Shiny, Slidify, and other tools ahead of time.
The topics that we've seen were difficult to learn by itself, and a better explanation could be very useful in practice.
However the Raspberry PI ecosystem has evolved since the course materials were created.
less theoritical).
Moreover, assignments are reviewed by people 1/ who did not necessarily went through the 2 previous courses 2/ did not see our previous documents ie for course 1 and 2 3/ did not necessarily understand the question (one person complained because I did not answer the question "edgy vs. conservative" => I guess she was misled by the support info which were the same as for the first course).
This problem could be avoided by offering a distinct case for each assignment, so that there is no confusion/mis-match.
In any case, "mange tak" for all your courses.
I posted a question on the last week on the forum and never received an answer from a mentor.
The teacher is very passionate; therefore I enjoyed the topics that were taught very differently than when I took AP Calculus AB in high school.
Only run, run, run, and less participation than courses before.
Weeks 4 and 5 are way too light.
The last one took about 3 days!That being said, if the rspec tests weren't being run in dev mode, it might have been quicker.
The modules are rampant with bias against "big food," without considering the science.
it could have been better if it was more hands-on learning, for instance I don't understand why did we learn CLI till now and how will I link it to my studies
The Course itself is fun.
While the topics covered by the course represent a fair amount of the information a coach should have, psychologycal and social aspects, which are quite important for training young athletes, are not convered in depth.
They have a lot of good material.
I have had to supplement a lot of the material I missed through other resources.
Looking forward to the more in-depth courses in the specialization.
Too easy, really.
Had to spend some unpredictable amount of time digging into some questions (probably, it is fine, but the difference between 2 previous courses and this one in the program is vivid).
The leap from HTML, CSS to JavaScript is massive.
No exercises, no real world scenarios...
But it's only the start!
Poor video editing.
The course videos are hard to follow.
it's fine, not technical but ok
Don't expect to learn much about the brain though.
is better way to go for me; however, I cannot afford it finance or time - therefore, am trying to learn as much as possible off here.
Kudsos to Parente for having super cool interests though - the sailing, the places he sails and the awesome vacation home in the Scottish Highlands!
On a whole I am satisfied with he expanse of the course curriculum.
Exercises for Scikit-learn users were not organised.
Course took too long to start
The final module is vague , but the course is nice as a whole
Lenskit is painful to use and in the week 4 Honors assignment its just impossible to get the results desired by the grader.
I have no way of accessing discussions and my final assignment to see any feedback classmates have given.
Why is this its own class?
Nevertheless it was quite fun to listen the lectures and that's why course went pretty fast.
Some more information regarding the HTML attributes like area controls would have been good.
Reading and only reading!
I understand having a student stretch for an assignment, but this seems more like incomplete instruction.
Interesting class, but somewhat frustrating at times.
Mostly due to the fact that there were no practical exercises included.
I'm leaving because I can't keep up with an 8 week course given in 4 weeks, and even less if the course keep on refering to the 8 weeks time frame.
The errors in speaking made me uncomfortable.
not as clear as the previous courses
The books, readings, and additional resources for studying are really good and helpfull.
Wouldn't give it 5 stars because most part during the video lectures are just silly and although I know the professor is trying his best to convey an idea, it seems like there are moments it just drifts away from the point.
The case studies is a very positive resource to have in the course to think critically.
What I didn't like: The course is excessivelly short, with only 30-40 minutes of videos per module.
A lot of broken swirl(), which wouldn't be so bad except *a lot* of this course is based entirely on swirl().
This could probably be better broken into two one week courses "History of Phone Technology" and "Intro to IoT".
A little disappointed.
I understand that someone with lesser background in the relevant areas might not agree with me.
Repetitive and surprisingly dry course.
The course is useful mainly for pulling various strands together, but don't expect much depth.
I would have appreciated more content in the videos.
Altogether a useful introduction to an interesting topic -- despite the generalizing approach and the sometimes conservative instead of neutral presentation.
Some definitions might be difficult to understand especially how it would be applied in real life.
Exactly the course itself is clear enough to understand, but the quiz part doubles the difficulties to comprehend.
Some interesting stuff in there.
A couple of lectures need video editing though.
Peer-graded assignments are bad for multiple reasons.
It is a good introductory course, but the technical aspect for this module is bad...
However it teaches lot of practical concepts using Tableau which is a commercial software.
Since these concepts entirely new to me.
You can't actually expect much from this anyway.
Most of the courses/lectures seemed to be very basic Project Management principles.
I hope it can be improved in the future!
I didn't really get the difference theory vs practice between this course and the previous one "Digital Analytics for Marketing Professionals: Marketing Analytics in Theory".
Sometimes the assignments were not very interesting, and didn't always help practicing the content exposed in the lectures... For example, the piece about the different statistical tools: I didn't get why it was included in the course... either we do exercises on it, or it shouldn't be in the course... but there is not point of knowing by heart the differences between the different statistical tools.
The part about the customer decision journey, the plan for analytics, and the different analysis techniques were very interesting.
The quizzes/tests were also based on regurgitation of data/knowledge, rather than higher-order thinking such as application or synthesis
The peer grading system need improvement.
I was impressed of that.
A little light on the theory
Subject matter is excellent, but I feel that the course material had too many trick question for a beginner.
Found it a bit hard to follow, some aspects could've been explained in more detail.
I'd change the way of how the assignments are presented to prove the students' skills.
Even though I passed every exam and assignment, I found this course extremely difficult.
I very much enjoyed the setup of the course, that is the short introduction and then the discussion of different artworks per theme.
Good as just an introduction to data science.
Just not as much as I'd hoped.
This is not a live lecture so it could be worth practicing and recording a clean quality speech.
But the course' main contents and Practices are still relevant.
Actually I know a bit python and it seems that the course was not that meangingful to me but the teacher and assignment are really nice!!
More participation by the professor would be appreciated.
Good concise introduction for the topic.
Considering this is the last step to the Capstone Project, I had greater expectations for it.
Needs more depth.
The course was a bit too shallow for me, the techniques shown are very basic examples of what can be learnt using stock python libraries (json, socket, urllib, ElementTree) or external (BeautifulSoup).
I really expected something more, for instance authentication techniques, or methods to parse complex websites, rather or in addition to the basics shown here.
Nevertheless the training course material is too theorical.
Going through every feature in Lightroom is not helpful.
Some lecturers did not deliver a good presentation and some "philosophical masterpiece" are not practical at all.
If you are trying to get by with casual interest, then this is not the course for you.
They are completely raw and difficult to use.
Furthermore, I don't think it is normal that people duly registered to the class have difficulties to get their 3 reviews.
I think the level was a bit on the low side and the time i had to spend on each week was far less compared with the first module.
It would seem to be unwise to pay for the following courses if this continues on.
4/5 for content, 2/5 for presentation.
It may complement what you've already learnt by articulating the concepts well, but the lecture videos felt redundant after reading material for Week 1.
I definitely would recommend more essential books and maybe TED Talks as well.
Great books on communication were written by William UryGetting to YesGetting to Yes with yourself (essential book)Beyond Reasonhttps://www.

Would've enjoyed a more descriptive course with more emphasis on the financing and operational side as well as how the wind facilities fit into the grid.
This course is not for javascript beginners.
A course which has great assignments.
Could have been better if part of the solution is given.
I know that form is important but there was no mention of modulation, chord progressions or cadence styles (John versus Paul).
Content in these courses seem more "new manager / new supervisor" level, if not actually geared toward an undergrad audience.
Content was good and questions were well-thought.
The conclusions in the course are not convincing, or at least not presented in a convincing way.
Felt like a falling asleep university course.
It was not very intuitive and I struggled for over 2 weeks to put the Project together due to this gap.
But a worthwhile class with great potential.
Exercise need to be more heavy
But I have two main reservations about the course.
The course in general is not as good as Martin Odersky's first course, but it still has interesting bits to learn about functional programming.
Everything topic feels very disconnected to each other.
Lastly, the last part of the course is specially disorganized.
However, for people who are not familiar with pandas library it may be very challenging to pass assignments.
This course is very challenging.
Teachers were enthusiastic and the brevity of the course gives it good appeal for beginners who want to "get their feet wet".
The sections on bootstrapping and permutations were great!
Not much information for people who already work in related projects.
The instructors are excellent and the content is really good.
"Data Analysys Tools" course is a good complement in order to understand the subject.
Interesting material produced and comprehensive information but the lecture itself is mostly slide reading
Few tools on Xls has been shown.
More extensive and complex problem are required on use of Monte Carlo method
There is a large gap between the course material and the assignments.
The main problem for me with this course was the assignment.
However, I expected much more from the course.
Again, you are on your own.1.
Interesting concepts.
This serves well as a basic intro but not for people who are looking for a deeper dive.
Is not a completed and structured course.
Perhaps they should invest more on gradual exercises like the one they advised to do on github or some easy statistical exercises... Now I don't know if I should take the next module or if I should look for something out of here where I can learn R. I see potential on this course.
More specific grading rules needed.
Finally, some of the questions on the final quiz are confusing.
Doing this course first doesn t make you anticipate how difficult could this speciality in the next courses :p
Too expensive for the material it provides; it is helpful and necessary but this course can be summarised in 1-2 lectures.
Fantastic course mentor/TA.
The contents do not cover a whole lot of ground.
The thing is that the peer review criteria do not really provide a good basis to ensure that learners did indeed assimilate the course contents.
Not deeply explained not for beginneer.
).
While the assessment tasks were great exercises, the fact that they're peer-reviewed means that the feedback you get is often unhelpful or poorly informed.
It was a good course to do, but I don't think it's really going to change anyone's life (and I would encourage people to not take the peer feedback too seriously!
A huge downside is that it is very difficult to follow the course because of the professors' strong accent and, at times, incorrect pronunciation.
E.
g.
Also may be because of my engineering approach towards management.
Good but can be long due to accompany material
Worthwhile introduction.
Seemed to stick to the bare minimum of what would be required before moving to the quiz.
They need to keep in mind this is BASIC statistics, so cut down on the jargon.
not very creative in terms of approach
The approach was solid.
it is okay, not what I expected, but okay.
from a technical perspective I am not sure the system is working at 100%.
Great starting point.
But if you already have some experiencie this course is very very basic.
The lectures were good, but many assignments had errors (graders, errors in code)
It's all clear enough, and delivered pretty much exclusively in traditional lecture format--there's even a lectern.
To be clear this criticism is not of the Professor, or to say that down side risk and risk management are not sufficiently discussed, but merely that IMHO the course could benefit from more discussion and material on the negative aspects/ramifications of unfettered capitalism, especially given the large amount of time spent discussing the 2008 recession.
All that being said, I learned a lot from this course and found it very interesting and informative.
The content was excellent, although a bit repetitive at the end.
Not so practical
It's not bad, but not amazing.
The course was very interesting.
Good pace of lectures.
And Ms. Meloni is a delightful instructor -- she actually makes you wish the presentations were a lot longer than they are.
Very little content.
I would recommend to others looking for a first course in neural networks (for machine learning applications) look for a newer course.
Program instructions could be more specific.
Access to assignments and grades should be given.
I feel the contents of this course were great, no second thought on it.
the course stays a bit superficial
The topic is too big, for one course from my point of view.
Not enough face to camera time, in comparison with the other two modules in this course specialization.
The final quiz took me over 8 hours mostly because there was no one to ask for hints when I was totally stuck and confused!
Pretty decent class but zero communication.
Overall the course is very good but it gets trickier the further you go, specially if you have no experience in this area whatsoever... Take it from someone who's first contact with Web Development was the first course in this Specialization: "HTML, CSS & JavaScript".
However, I made it through with a decent mark so I'm grateful for it.
The swirl exercises is a very good practical learning tutorial that supplements the course, but overall it still lacks on the conceptual aspect.
Prof. Koller is knowledgeable and presented the materially logically.
You have to have worked in R to have even a minor chance at succeeding on the assignments.
This situation gets worse in the last two weeks and you can hardly breathe.
The recommended reading in the book also focus on these two distributions (the recommended reading actually skips the section on geometric distribution, if I remember well).
He (and the course) demonstrates what can and cannot (presently) be scientifically proven about meditation.
Asigments are too easy to implement
There wasn't much to learn that I didn't already know.
I think this course is missing some key elements for a complete beginner.
I like the in depth discussion over various introduced data structures, for instance there are comparisons between naive implementations vs smarter implementations.
Would like it to cover more content, specially around handlebars.
:)) I just wish you kept the discussion boards open, so we have a platform to discuss ideas and exchange recipes.
Not very proper explanation of How to use Control key with mouse to set button properties.
No discussion forum
There were several examples like this.
I found the content was great but the style of lectures were a bit too robotic and not conversational.
For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.
I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better.
This is a motivational course, but it's not very extensive.
I think each lesson should be accompanied by an optional exercise.
This was a little light, despite the fact that this is not my area of expertise.
I watched the entire set of week one lectures, and sadly I do not think this is up to scratch with the rest of the material on Coursera.
But recommended for people who want an introduction to positive psychology.
Interesting to try R hands on.
Should provide more examples and exercises for every topic.
Also it'll be better if teacher more clarify all the actions he doing.
Too fast speech/ language use in combination with poor english translation, otherwise pretty well done.
This is such a cornerstone topic to the Data Science Specialization that I think it deserves a better designed and more polished curriculum.
Probably one of the main problems of the subject "Wind Energy" itself, is it covers many disciplines (Aerodynamics, Mechanics and Machinery, Structural design, Electricity and Grid connection, Financial aspects...), so a 5-Week course had to be quite superficial to cover each of this aspects minimally.
I teach young children, and it seemed reminiscent of the way I have to talk to them sometimes.
base coursera.
Despite all of that, I've learned some valuable information.
So far so good!
Overall the course content is good, but the power points are not engaging and interactive.
Video lectures however would need written notes to accompany them.
May be make it the 1st module, with other modules going back for a brief historical overview
The course is fine, but I won't call it really "advanced" one.
For example, i wish we could have learned some simple conversational phrases, early on, just to get started, without worrying right away about all the sounds.
A lot of info cramped in long videos makes it confusing sometimes
An alright starting course, but the exercises could be a little more in depth
So simple, not enough informative.
It is already known things for a manager with some experience leading teams.
the capstone project had peer reviews, requesting you to consider executive feedback, otherwise i am not able to actually judge the quality of my work
The course is not very well developed like course 1, 2, 3.
Outside of quizzes which are graded by computers, your "practice" assignments (which aren't practice because you can't check your answers before a test, super awesome when you can't really ask for help), final project and forum questions are graded or answered by other students.
If you have any confusion, either it will go unresolved or be worsened by potentially wrong answers from other students which I saw happen many, many times.
however, the course is more a history of smartphone operating systems than emerging trends of the technology.
Although Content quality was good, the content is too much less and could have been easily integrated to first course or other course in specialisation.
Secondly Quiz were not challenging ,it was just too easy to pass, and this actually takes away the very reason they were employed in this course.
)I would have found the class more effective with a demeanor that was enthusiastic without being histrionic.
For each assignment I had at least one of the three peer reviews that was useless to me to improve my writing, sometimes more.
The upside is that if you want to get a taste you can.
There is a lot of repetition of concepts throughout the course and this can become distracting.
and submitting it for peer review would have been more productive.
Very high level.
You need an engineering background to know how to interpret the equations enough to finish the coding assignments in Matlab.
Interesting for US-Americans or people who are interested in US-American Epidemiologics.
This class gets very math and theory heavy, so I would not recommend it for those looking for programming practice with the algorithms/programming approaches presented in this class.
Very fast , no passion or whatsoever.
I guess 3 stars is fair enough.
It is an interesting course, as a first contact with epidemiology and public health
I would have preferred a better balance between tutorials and reading.4.
In fact, seems more like an explanation than a test.
Basic but interesting for novices.
Hence not a good use of a video session.
B) Week 1 and the 1st half of Week 6 were redundant.
C) It would be much better to have a 7-week course with more topics and may be with some optional videos on Bayesian model, HMM.
Not hugely informative for someone who's looking to learn about the links between what we eat and how we eat, and how human bodies respond.
I opted out of this course in favour of the one from the Hong Cong University, sorry =)
It is interesting and mind opening during the beginning and the middle of the course.
Details and elaborated explanation would have been excellent.
I mean not so many people use Pro Tools for composing.
Also, it is possible to offer a toolkit pages in each module to faciltate teaching..
Besides, I've learned spark basics which is super cool...
so thanks for thatMaybe you could consider to build docker image instead of using virtual machines.
The final assignment was peer reviewed, but the feedback (based on student feedback) was not very useful.
Almost didn't finish it in time because it was due right after Christmas.
Would like more hands-on assignments throughout the course instead of one at the end.
Could do a better job of teaching more of the fundamentals involved in the Programming Assignments.
(Whether it's a situational question or behavioral).
Instead, there was one slide that touched on this quickly, somewhere in the middle.
I don't think the shown expected time to complete each assignment is totally unrealistic.
plz last lecture in this course, you can better understanding to me.
The subtitles don't help either because they were auto-generated.
As was mentioned in another review, the course feels abandoned.
I dind't really like the massive use of the terms "kind of" (often used to explain concepts) and for this reason I still have to finish it.
I will quickly 'cause I 'm looking forward to learning something else.
The course is very helpful, but it's an extremely messy program and needs more work done to it.
However, the course hasn't been focused on programming with JavaScript to solve real problems.
I would not have been able to pass without the discussion forum tips.
Next, you ask us to rewrite the introduction, which we do with those two problems in mind.
It seems like fine software but if you arent going to purchase a license after the class expires whats the point?
The key is not a software itself but the methodology using in the one.
The videos were very well made, and quite nice to watch.
However, I feel like the material was a bit too easy for my taste.
Of course I did purchase the book and workbook created by the author and have found them to have additional material to support application.
This and the lack of any review of linear algebra and vectorized solutions, I think, is giving some students the impression that they should be coding loops in their functions to build and solve ML models.
Next, I am auditing the course, and this is the first course where I was not able to submit quizzes.
I'd recommend everybody to take this course but I certainly wouldn't do it again and neither dowload the videos for future reference.
I would make it a 5 but this course will not list on my "completed courses" and that annoys me.
Sometimes I did not know where I needed to focus.
Also documents not updated with current information
Historically the basic background have been discussed.
Good overview of Cloud related technologies.
I dislike fixating to any software.
The homework assignments were substantial, and I enjoyed doing the final assignment which required merging two or more datasets using Pandas and then Matplotlib to plot relationships.
not helpful, too many concepts and content-of-no-use.
It was definitely interesting plus interviews with well know people is a huge plus.
Still, I think it could be ramped up a bit.
The philosophical approach the professors take is to give you a taste of a variety of machine learning models.
I felt a little cheated by this approach to a subject which should be really fascinating.
While some of my concerns may be addressed in follow on courses, I am left with little insight into what really lies ahead.
His first language is not English, so I do not expect him to speak perfect English.
It is still a very enlightening course.
the lectures are full of the Prof misspeaking, this leads to you not knowing how to complete the task because the Prof can NOT communicate properly to us while we listening to the lectures... it seems like they completely missed the fact that NONE of us are data scientists...
Now your Audience......
Expected more from it.
This is a good course to introduce the novice to financial terms used in common place.
But in my opinion, the instructor could have a gone a bit further, explaining about Markets, Stocks, Bonds etc.
Types of transactions involved.
Maybe its expecting too much, but still, just a suggestion
The assignments are just taking screenshots of running code that is already provided to you in the code repository for this course.
My review is biased because I already took Music Business Foundations from Berklee on Coursera and the material w
My 3/5 star rating comes from the fact that I think their could be more content / examples shown in the videos.
Instructors tend to talk too fast and read off the slides verbatim instead of thoroughly explaining the topic
It caused me to submit my assignment late, and it was just not a pleasant process.
more scientific evidence would have been useful
A good course that could be better.
I think that this course provided a reasonable introduction to Matplotlib, but the lectures need to go a bit deeper and provide more examples.
I think overall from Coursera I'd like to see more interaction and graded programming exercises in between videos to really hammer the concepts home.
'Introduction' or maybe' Overview ' may have been more accurate.
I failed the question, and understood why I failed based on the course content litterally minutes after failing the question (and one mentor actually rightly corrected me).
This course will be helpful for brands / people who begin their journey with personal branding and social media.
The videos were not as polished as those in the previous courses.
Feels like the material worth 10 weeks was crammed into 4 weeks.
You can still learn some important conceptions, so it is not a total waste of your time.
Could have more in-depth information.
On the other hand, if you take the course as a whole, then yes, the population would be better off if we all followed the suggestions contained in this course than if we continue on our current path for how we consume food.
The instructions weren't clear for anyone taking the class which resulted in incredibly difficult grading.
E.
g., Chi-squared test and null hypothesis.
The course ramps up way to quickly with the project if all you have been doing is following the videos, students should be practicing and proving they know the work far more often.2.
It was still a good refresher to have.
What a pity!
However, the lectures are too short and do not help much with doing the assignment.
It was nice experience, but to be hones I expected more information about this topic and that is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.
Only some information is relevant.
Students are left to collaborate amongst themselves and figure out a solution.
I wish there would be more materials to practice with.
What's the point of learned all these formulas by heart if you cannot use the properly because that is not explained well.
Eventhough everything was understandable
It's also much better at twice speed, but most classes are.
Maybe upload new instructions with screenshots, or make another lecture video on how to submit.
But not fully live up to my expectations !
Pretty high level overview.
If one is only concerned with the spoken word, then you'll gather an okay amount of information.
It's quite simple and doesn't show specific steps of how to do it.
You have to pay to take the the tests.
Although a good introduction course, sometime is focus on javascript tools rather than on AngularJS itself which, in hand, looses time and doesn't explain/give examples on how to create directives and filters, which are two core functionalities of this framework.
Just an easy intro, which you can complete in a couple of days.
The instructions for writing the essays were confusing.
Also, unsynchronized subtitles were a bit annoying same for the poor sound from invited professors in air pollution videos of chapters 4 and 5.
(To be precise there are tiny mistakes related to headers and graphics which make the materials looks untidy).4.
The time / usefulness rate of this course is very low.
Some interesting topics and detailed insight, but the course could be more systematic.
Felt the final coding assignment was a bit vague as far as instructions and the video.
I checked the accompanying book, and the first mention of two-sided hypothesis test is way way way further in the book, in a chapter that is entirely focusing on inference.
The second occurrence was in week 4.
For someone like me, it was a motivation to be learning the subject from him but I was left disappointed a little bit.
Class was really easy.
The last assignment is not really well designed specially the trajectory part.
I had to watch the videos more than two times to try to figure out what was LDA, and a Quora article posted in the Forum could explain it much better.
Then we get to the Hierarchical Clustering module, which was the most poorly module in all this specialization.
With nothing to analyze, I did not think fair to give a low rating, so I preferred not to analyze.
First two weeks are too repetitive with other courses
Then were students alloweed to download MATLAB freely!
This is a very good and informational course : however, the person who is speaking tends to have a lot of mums and stammers a lot.
The minor hands on labs that were provided, were challenging for anyone that is not familiar with Python script writing.
However, the problem sets in this programming challenge are often not so well-defined, which makes it really difficult to solve (especially the dataset problem).
Missing in-lesson quiz, with all the homeworks being at the end of the week: this make following the pace quite tough
As a beginner, this cours is greate
Very poorly constructed with links in the final exam that didn't work so I couldn't finish the exam.
good but sometimes cannot hear clearly what the tutor says whenever they have strong Spanish accent.
Last, the questions in the assignments were sometimes not so much to check your understanding but your memory about a small detail like a % in a study that is already obsolete by the time we learn it...
All in all a great course, with great instructors but still room for improvement as a mooc.
It is not entry course!
Gives a nice high altitude overview of the subject but little else.
The course is excellent, but there is mistakes in quiz and the forum participation is null.
It's ok for an extremely high-level overiew
Great for beginners.
The assignment did not feel particularly relevant to the bulk of the course materials.
I did learn.
How about a segment on running regressions?
Very practical and to the point.
Course content not designed to be difficult.
The assignments require Java programming experience (not mentioned in course description).
So can't comment on the participation from other students or TAs.
Future Advice -Considering how other courses offer about 1-2 hours of course videos, I think this course could offer a lot more.
It really needs to be re-done.
It's an high level introduction but definitely no specialisation.
Only the LTE part is much better and in more detail right now.
Btw.
More spoken details between the lines would be nice.
Finally, I would like to suggest the authors of the course modeling the curriculum following the amazing treatment of the subject found in "Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshiriani et.
I learn some interesting things.
The main concepts would require more explanation.
Interaction with other learners would be very beneficial in a form of group assignment.
I don't understand the lack of balance between theory and hands on (Not enough hands on to reflect the theory) part.
On a constructive note, I would replace some of the theoretical concepts of week 3 with additional information on how to link a graph database to machine learning OR I would add more hands on exercise to help using those more complex concepts and learn how to interpret them.
It's immensely fussy (as I understand it has to be), but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don't sufficiently explicitly define whats expected.
Great ideas for cooking.
And quizzes with questions that cannot be answered from the course texts.
the teacher is boring.
I assume that instructor involvement in project revision is impossible in this kind of online course; but perhaps, if the issue is that people aren't getting their work reviewed, there could be an incentive for reviewers, for example, get an instructor/mentor review, if you submit at least, say, 10 thorough peer reviews.
The Swirl package is good
I appreciate knowing more now than I did before about story writing.
the tutor is very fun and it makes me feel clearly about calculus.
for me too much graded questions - but in generall the course is good
This is less about master data analysis in Excel, and more about gaining ground in a few key concepts, so the title is misleading as well.
Without support, a simple challenge supposed to take a few minutes can turn into hours, days.
The material contains many detailed personal examples and another great value of the course is in sharing experiences in the forums.
This is a brief overview, basically food for thought.
breaking down the videos into various little ones would be more productive i think.
more practical projects&homework would be great!
The script was great - very insightful and informative, but having the presenter talk for the whole lecture without more frequent use of diagrams, figures, etc.
At times, basic things mentioned elsewhere are repeated, some others are not explained sufficiently.
I did find it frustrating that some of the answers to the quiz assignments could not be found in the required reading, videos, or slideshows.
Gives a good overview of topics and the specialisation, however is still very basic.
But for the beginners it is ok.
It was a good Mooc, but I think it should imply many more examples to be made by the own students along the course.
It was insinuated that Lamarckism plays a significant role in evolutionary biology, something that is widely questioned by eminent specialists in evolutionary biology (for ex.
This course needs tremendous improvement.
Still, it has a very good content.
It would be more helpful with full use of digital blackboard when talking through the rationales behind finance.
Well designed, but not for advanced game developers.
The course was very basic and there was nothing new in the videos compared to the document(PDF) .
Everything was mostly theory based without any practical examples.
It does not mention dashes and colons.
needs more info and practical references
I found the course was unfortunately slightly dry - I was expecting more from the videos.
A pity, I loved this course.
Looking forward to week 2.
I didn't like how there was no interaction with the other classmates or there was no easy way to comment, but I loved the way it was so interactive
The learning curve shoots up exponentially around the fourth week.
Material is presented clearly and lectures are well-delivered.
This was more of here's a slide, I will read what's on the slide and explain some topics.
The answer choices for the quiz are so obvious and can be easily guessed.
However, the assignments were ridiculous.
So first of all, the material for this course in the bookdown document are very good - well structured, with good sources.
But after I spend hours raising my intellectual level trying to understand what they're talking about, I still have no idea what is the purpose of the meditation.
Or rather I have it, but from another source, from a person who's been practicing it for 20 years.
I prepared a Spotify list that includes the songs mentioned during the course but It's better to listen the music or see the lyrics during the course.
Thank you very much :)
Missing course material about how calculating fact table size ans sparsity
That was all new and fascinating.
We surely all know that the human power is vital to the develop of any given organization.
This is a good start up course to learn about tinkering fundamentals.
Too easy if you already know anything about github or Rstudio, although I do understand the need for an introductory course.
I appreciate though putting the tools into action and having to work on the competitive position assignment, it provides great insights on what matters in a competitive market.
The videos are very dry and not entirely helpful.
Participation requires running arbitrary JS written by other students.
Material is all fine.
If you expect to learn about robotics motion and mobility you have to go to other books of these themes.
There are too much questions in my opinion and are tedious to solve or answer.
Again, good beginning course, but I was looking for more in depth study.
legal aspects of Bitcoin.
Well done!Coming from a non medical background I found this course very challenging.
Every chapter has at least one error.
What an awesome lady.
All the tasks have automatic grader.
The materials were interesting and relevant.
not using scikit and assigment way too easy, not challenging, but high quality video, very easy to understand .
That's meaningless.
Could go a little more in detail on the algorithms.
Tableau?
This class is very insightful for those interested in pursuing any career having to do with global health or traveling.
Some sections were rather basic, lacking insight on some topics.
Go for it
I work seemed a little too light.
Repetitions tend to lose emphasis of the main ideas.
With this class, you'll be in a position to create interesting applications using the Raspberry PiThere were two negatives to this class:1) Most of the assignments used the Node Red environment.
This course is good only for newbies and very high-level.
Not a well structured course.
As it happens when Brian Caffo explains the blocking adjustments part.
I wished the course had been more interactive and had spent more time on the chemistry of nutrition.
good introduction to raspeberry but very few about python programming, expected more
Hopefully MOOCs start having challenging assignments too.
The instructor explained really well too!I didn't really end up visiting the Discussion Forums for this course at all.
Else, need more details.
Video quality is often poor.
This course relies almost exclusively on self learning of the details of pandas.
While I really enjoyed the first module, I was less impressed by this one.
I'm quite sure that the next iteration of this course can get a 5 star rating, but for now, it's only 3.
Some course content are not updated (links not working).
The websites should have the broadest data - good regardless of what country you're in.
Good introduction
It's been a challenge to learn all these new concepts and package them into a working product in such a small period of time.
Since there is no recourse for a poor grade other than to resubmit an exercise to a new cohort of peers and hope that they are more fairly critiqued, this grading process puts students at the mercy of peers who either do not understand or do not care about the instructions for grading each other's work.
It's ok. After the first lesson, I should be able to provide a clear elevator pitch with a high level understanding of what I can expect to accomplish (4 or 5 steps) as a Data Scientist.
I also found the assignment to be less than clear.
Some concepts are not clearly explained , had to surf online to get better understanding.
Excellent content and overview of the field.
The course is 90% built on PMBOK.
And examples how to use these skill on nature life
I must say that the information on writing in the course was good, and the example of sanding, giving a critique etc.
I've learned many things but in the last week the lectures seemed very rushed.
I'd have like to dig deeper into mobile development instead of wasting time in appleTV
+ Very interesting course about emerging technologies; makes one understand the basics of IoT and AR interaction as well as functioning+ No electrical engineering background necessary+ Academic and supportive sources presented at the end of each lesson- Not very entertaining
There are neither required nor recommended readings at all.
Plus, I can't do the said assignment because I am a beginning on this topic.
This is probably useful for people wanting to learn techniques for data analysis, who need not go too deep into the technique.
I would recommend this to people learning techniques for data analysis in various non-mathematical and non-statistical fields, though the content lacks rigour, and you need outside sources to help understand techniques.
This course IS NOT WORTH PAYING USD79, there are definitely other courses much more worth the money.
This is a decent class, covering linear regression and a few of its variants in good detail.
No homework, only a 10 questions test every week (that is also extremely easy).
Videos were OK, practice quizzes somewhat helpful.
I learned so much.
A bit complex topics for just an introductory course.
Nevertheless interesting explanation on CAPM and ABT.
But this is probably not the best platform to do so.
Overall would recommend future iterations of this course, especially if the first two points above are improved upon.
It is a very good course where students get to learn about supply chain management.
course is somewhat efficient because the instructor is keep on reading the slides and nothing more than that!!
More exercises would help.
Very difficult to follow if you are not a programmer.
But the content is good and the Geneva teachers are nice (specially Michel!).
What was presented was straight-forward and quite well done.
The 3rd week of the course wasn't actually all that bad (though the quiz was terrible).
The presentation was quite fluffy yet the book is direct and straight to the point on the theory of negotiations.
(There is actually one such sound effect, but just one, so I won't quibble on that.
However, there didn't seem to be enough interaction with the professors themselves, and the grading by peers didn't make me feel like I really deserved the grade I got.
Thus the quiz is not any kind of assessment of actual knowledge.
The assignments do require a demonstration of some ability, but the grading scheme is sufficiently generous that a person who follows the instructions minimally will earn enough points so that, in conjunction with quiz scores, they pass and receive the certificate for the course.
This certificate program has high visibility in social media right now; it would be a shame for the certificate to devalue rapidly when it becomes clear to employers and students that the certificate does not, in fact, indicate that a person has passed any minimal threshold of knowledge or skill.
It may be that the Capstone project is graded quite rigorously, so that any slackers from the previous classes will not earn the certificate -- but that's a bit devious too.
The concepts were interesting and helpful.
It seems like it sticks out the most.
Still.
I created a support ticket through IBM and received support emails, but never got the confirmation email.
Good lecture and educational.
Extremely bad thing that is not offered and for free.
same bad is that they are not try to explain more, (for students with less tech skills).
In any case i am happy with the course and i will continue with the specialization, but regardless my decision to continue, my very fair rate will stay low, (especially for the fact that they didn't offer the course and for free).
Like I said, its only my opinion but this is where the interconnection and building of the knowledge base falls short at an early stage of development.
Hope this can be improved in the future.
Fascinating material; but accent of the lecturer was sometimes difficult to understand.
Content runs a bit fast but good course for stat inference with R focus.
We get the equations but not much insight into what it is a measure of and it's value.
This module could benefit of more examples when it comes to formulating strategies.
Why not spend more time on learning how to think innovatively?
The first week was interesting as it broke down the different layers that occur behind the scenes of matplotlib.
The material in the class is solid, but is poorly described.
Some things can be improved though.
The topics don't go beyond the surface and there is a lack of: details, examples, and comparisons between healthy diets and harmful ones.
As such, you'll find yourself constantly replaying certain parts to see what is typed.
Were this information presented in a more engaging way, this review would be much higher.
It's a good course, with valuable information about Storytelling applied for Leadership in organizations.
It have low practice exercises.
It was difficult to find the parts of the video to review missed questions because 1) the transcripts are machine generated and make it difficult to search specific words and 2) it's difficult to remember where the concept was covered because there was so much in each video.
The last week felt very disconnected from the first week and like it belonged in a different course almost.
Enjoyed the modules, especially final assignment.
A good introduction for "beginners", aka people who are not involved, educated or interested in public health, healthcare.
Also pausing the videos to watch the definitions in most cases was ineffective as it was hard to see it properly.
good introduction to 3D printing
But still i feel like things are going bit fast because I was not having any previous knowledge of data statistics or R language.
Learnt a lot of stuff on how things happen inside all of us.
Struggled in few sections, as i have not been in tough with physiology ...
Feel program could be much more valuable by using1) 3D videos to support the lecture2) more examples of the application of the concepts in real life3) increase the extent of interdisciplinary elements (Sports, medical, day in the life...)4) Videos of Experts to share their findings/research
Good course for beginners to get used to the terms of JavaScript and basic working.
Unfortunately it's not as good as the HTML and CSS courses in this specialization.
Not as useful as the first course.
Decent introduction.
Whenever there is a write in answer for a quiz question, I know I will get it wrong.
Someone with background in statistics would find this course more useful than on who only has basic knowledge of statistics.
You might think "it is not THAT bad", well there are sections that ask you to determine stability based on the length of the line... good luck with that (Spanish usually takes more words to write the same idea)
Course provides a simple introduction to Ruby.
Content wise this course is excellent, quant finance enthusiasts would love this course.
First of all the object oriented class had no practical assignment, and while others did, they weren't contributing for the learning.
It seems that the course has been made in a hurry.
The programs we wrote had to be pasted into a submission form that removed all the carriage returns when you hit Save; I had to manually fix my program each time.
Helpful and clear.
I would like it more if it had more elaboration and practice on the presented tools.
Thanks!
3.5+ star course.
So, course GREAT, administration of course, not so much.
Most of the content was included in Functional Programming in Scala and Reactive Programming Principles in Scala.
There is no conclusion if knowing accomplishing anything.
This is key.
Thoroughly enjoyed the lectures by M. Odersky!
Fortunately, the other moocs of the specialization are much much better!
Interesting how even established in a career can be considered a "generalist".
Extremely useful info, but the material is too shallow to be satisfying.
Despite having a strong engineering background, I found this course poorly communicated.
Very little course but gives you a base to understand how project management works
Very interesting, but I found it a little bit confusing.
Good frameworks that make a foundation.
At least it helps to feel the taste of quadrotor control.
I learned way much more on the previous modules of this specialization.
The course should be 2/5 stars, but thanks to Boston and McKenzie articles, I will give an extra one.
Sometimes the material was not explained sufficient enough to adequately complete the assignments.
I enjoyed the definitions and monetary examples.
While the content was helpful, this class could have been greatly improved if slides were provided instead of just a transcript.
Could have more information about concepts.
A B2B exercise would have been valuable as well because the markets act so different.
In particular I was surprised by the low quality of the material.
The following are my notes and suggestions:-- I found the lectures highly redundant, with many unnecessary repetitions-- using a vector notation (like an arrow or a simple line on top of the letters) throughout the course would have make formulas much more readable-- too much hand writing on the slides while talking: a better set of slides with blocks of text shown at the right moment would be much smoother and readable-- very, very poor video editing (many times it's clear some parts of the videos were meant to be cut!!)
I personally would have leaned better if the course were broken into smaller weekly segments.
Later courses are better.
Your final product will be displayed for everyone via ShinyApps and a presentation using R Presentation (also published via RPubs).
On a(nother) negative note, the topic of Natural Language Processing is not an easy one to just walk into and feel confident in providing a working next-word prediction algorithm in about eight (8) weeks.
Congratulations!
But I almost did not program!
A very basic course, suited for those who are getting started on physical activity.
I enjoyed it for my introduction to Coursera.
Swirl is still a great package for practice.
Most importantly, the assignments in no way reflected what was taught in the course videos.
One example of good presentation is the course of ML from Andrew Ng where he writes all the things while speaking which facilitates the student to follow the sequence.
Many sentences were written without punctuation or contained misspelled words.
was very useful to me as a writer just putting her work into the world.
Difficult to follow them.
I have seen reference to the previous second course on the specialization, 'Functional Reactive Programming in Scala', comparatively this one looks much easied down, I am hoping to find the excluded content on the third course.
It's a bit hard to answer the quiz since the presentation is not speaking about the qu
But I think it needs one more week discussion to improve improvisation.
Much math without the link to the praxis :-(
This is an amazing course, and taught by an extremely talented and accomplished professor.
I don't think it provides more than a simple youtube-search could.
Overall, a good average course.
I would prefer it if the assignments would be all applications and programming.
There is an assignment that asks you to create a single contrast composition of 2 shapes.
It's a good preview, but very little is actually learned here.
And even if he did mention it, it was only a kind of sidenoteand did not seem that important.
However, from Wharton, I would have expected more realistic examples.
After that, when you get into the actual content, it gets much better.
Assignments were just not that challenging except first one
The example showed is not very academic
Instruction was through watching other characters designers talk about their process.
I found the last couple weeks less helpful because of the large quantity of listed interventions without elaboration/examples - I did read the attached report but would have found it helpful to see some of the interventions demonstrated either via a video or diagram.
Very average this time around, not as design focused as the title of the course leads you to believe.
It took me 7 attempts to pass it as I had no idea what the first question was about and there was no guidance as to what I was doing wrong.
All you get a few short (two minutes or so) videos that give you little in the way of instruction or direction.
Thank you for offering this course for folks like me who need an introduction to Project Management.
On the other one gets what they pay for and I was overall glad to take the course and respect all the aspects except for the one already mentioned.
I'm glad I good the course, and I'm speechless that I finally finished it with a passing albeit imperfect score.
Most of the materials are conceptual, would like to see more real life examples and methods applied.
There was a greater emphasis on programs and practices in the U.
S.
A.
Although I turned my assignment in well-ahead of the due date/time, I had to transfer to the following class because I could not get the required peer reviews (2) prior to the course closing, despite multiple requests in the discussion forum for assistance.
This would be a far better use of the lecture time than trying to combine the two and not doing a good job of either.
A lot of material is presented here which is both good and bad.
By some uncanny chance, I have just managed to pass the final assignment on my fourth try, which means I have passed my course.
Was equally challenging and FUN to learn RORThanks :)PS : Please initiate the Re-Payment process or at least reply to student's grievances in the Help and Support Forum.
When structure and semantics are essential, text inside tag is not, guessing if exists space between elements isn't acceptable as well.
This course encouraged me to think critically about mental health, specifically major depression from a public health perspective.
Overall good course.
This course mostly teaches the basic usage of the caret package.
need to be more advanced even for a beginner.
It is a great topic, with wonderful clips from movies and is well-written.
Why only 3 stars then?For a class about film little was adopted from good storytelling and filming techniques.
interesting and clear.
At times I thought the instructional videos were very short - I would have liked them to have been longer, perhaps going into more depth about some of the topics covered in the reading materials - I was not fond of the written portion of the course - I would have preferred exams to the written portion.
thanks.
This course is just AMAZING!
I really enjoyed the teacher, as well.
It's a good course for those that are seeking to improve their grammar skills in English, but for me it sounded a little superficial and the peer review system for this course left space for some subjectivity.
Good course, but assignment instructions were difficult to understand at times and no examples were given.
This is an instructive course but not represented in a very engaging way.
(2) The course is too simplistic.
But interesting none the less, & a fascinating insight into how few people apparently cook their own food.
Effort was to make it nationalistic and emotional.
Significance of Menorah as a symbol is absolutely missing.
A very useful course for budding professionals.
I am most of the time decoding scripts.
presentation is poor, not very engaging
Might have been helpful to have more case studies.
However, he does point out many holes in the course as it currently is, and I'd have to agree with him.
The last 3 weeks could have been a course on its own if properly explored.
Good content..
but should also have some graded excercises
Finally I bit the bullet and completed the final 2 weeks.
All the parts are equally important.
This course is much more informative than the previous two in my opinion.
!
Useful eye opener in different directions.
Out-dated, could use an wisp of technology update with a few years since recording.
VirtualBox is default to 32 bit/ubuntu when the image is 64 bit/Centos/Redhat.
In addition the course content is a bit little.
The course was interesting, but unfortunately it really felt like it was tailored to a male audience.
The Assignments do not require just what is being taught, and demands a lot of google and stack overflow research in order to solve the problems.
Good course on the various Ps, legal needs, technology needs and what it means to be Inc.
I hope the instructors create more videos for the same content.
simple and easy for Python beginners, the instructor also has a textbook that could be good instruction.
Severe lack of activity from TA(s) on the forums.
Would have preferred more depth!
Than, at week4, you need to create a prototype, digital or non-digital, based on your creations.
What if I can't pay right now, but will be able to pay at the end to receive my certificate?
It says 3 weeks but I finish it in 2 days.
I had to struggle a lot to grasp the concepts on advanced algorithms by just relying on video lectures so I had to look around in the internet for additional resources.
The lenght of the lectures is short and these are very well organized by modules, facilitating the learning process.
Quizzes cannot be taken unless you purchase the course.
not enough practical skills or tools teaching
Course was poorly put together with errors that are not fixed.
I think that this course has wonderful material, however, I think that more than 2 people should be required to peer review the assignments so it is a balanced grade.
and then explaining how caret can simplify it.
Pros: a lot of programming in automated online environment.
Cons: inconsistencies in code like changing parameter order in often used functions, changing structure of some variables (arrays become dicts).
Either the quiz questions were bad or it was taught in a confusing manner.
These are often the only points explained.
I guess this course helped to develop the tones and the recognition of them, but, I think that a little shape in the characters and how each sound could improve this course a lot.
However, because I did not put into a basic outline form, I received a failed score.
Coursera must supervise the grading process.
This one got away from me.
Yeah, this course is REALLY different from other MOOCs.
Would never call it a university course.
I would also have appreciated some discussion again about metrics in this course - specifically related to content marketing.
It is also based on Alex Cowans' venture design process but this time on each step you do things that differ from what was taught in the previous course.
Good course overall.
While I can appreciate that every course will require some elements of self-learning and exploration, this felt a step too far.
Could've been much more clear with the examples if there were some loads of practice problems
Find it way too easy; 2.
Good course if you are driven and can teach yourself.
Not much content for this course, can be done in a few hours.
At some point, of the course it became really difficult to follow, right?.
About: First Lessons contain some Interface/Questionnaire errors.
Hi, I reckon it's a tad too early to rate this course since it is only going to start - but I didn't see another option to contact the Course Administrator other than trough the rating process.
When going through the introduction of this course, there were multiple errors in the Quizzes/Q&A's.
Something must be wrong with my brain or how the course is designed.
There is a lot happening within any framework and understanding the how, and why of web design is just as important as getting the final product.
They are pretty close to covering just what you need to actually do machine learning in the real world and not dive too deep into topics that have no practical value.
However:This course was a bit too thin, the last 4 weeks of the course contained little in depth informations and seemed to brush over allot of different topics that could have contained more information.
If you remember seeing something on one of the slides shown, you'll have to look back, scanning through all the videos trying to find it.
The course was alright in the sense that it was descriptive, however, the level of critical thinking suggested for the course was not actually indicative of the material presented.
A lot of the material presented was great, but when the quiz came around, questions regarding the material were unequal.
Recheck the grading protocol to make certain it is properly evaluating the answers.
Prof Aarabi is an award-winning professor at U of Toronto, but it turns out he knows little about iOS and has Jack Wu teach most of the material.
(Affinity designer for instance).
Week 2 is problematic if you have a complex idea, let's say it's still doable, but you would certainly need more time than expected weekly hour work.
Not enough coding opportunities.
I just felt that the lectures needed a bit more structure since there didn't seem to be a very good transition between topics.
Sometimes the teacher only shortly mentions things and then goes on with major exlanations about other things.
Several harder concepts could be covered in the time that the course ran.
Informative and provide some great ideas and insights.
I cannot recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people.
It might be because high expectations or another target audience for the course, but full course content could be fit to the first week.
I don't think this model is suitable for online delivery.
I think there needs to be more association elaborated between the video lectures and the questions being asked during the lectures.
Maybe if I had bought the book that goes along with the course, i would have gained more insight but as a standalone course, it rates just three stars.
Not much real coverage on post-production; mostly just an intro and that was at the expense of more learning on composition.
Course has very good content and well structured.
Also during the course, the teaching was fast and there was lot of content to understand.
For example: IMHO it makes little sense to ask for numbers of paragraphs in the quizzes - its not only a waste of time to learn them by heart but also it hinders the participants to show their understanding of the material.
Please believe me when I say that I run a copy of Fusion 360 at the same time as a particular instructional video is playing.
Got the feeling that the exercises cover only a little part of the theoretical content exposed in the lectures.
But I’m excited for the rest of the courses!
It contradicts "triangular theory of love" and the lecturer doesn't even explain why.
I thought the teacher was going waaay too fast.
Congrats to the team!
It was good but the examples could have been better and there could have been more material.
Otherwise, Professor Maurice Schweitzer did a great job with providing engaging examples in each video and I got to know a lot of new stories worldwide.
The later part of the sessions lacks practical applicability and it is more abstract, that I find difficult to relate
Got something out of the course but the potential was there for much more.
The course was marked as completed when I finished the 3rd assignment so the fourth lesson was effectively optional.
I enjoyed the course but I think that it could have been more informative and a bit less repetitive.
But there are two things I don't like.
However it's really hard to talk about the music of the Beatles and not nine able to even quote from their songs, much less play their music!
I was not interested in the work of the more recent photographers/photo manipulators.
It would have been nice to really focus on great content types, versus share, share, share.
I wish the course would take more advantage of interactive multimedia tools in order to support the spoken word with visual means.
Otherwise the sentence is at best grammatically incorrect, and at worst misleading.
Another significant issue with this "Bit Data" course is that it assumes a user understands data base and can construct sql queries.
Since it is a very theoretical subject, trying to explain it without proofs and plenty of background is hard.
I wish there was more that would delve into more examples in more details.4.
I agree with some of the reviews here.
Good vibe but way too easy.... even for beginners!
The Quizz need a real involvement of the student to be completed; challenging but I personnaly appreaciated very much.
HTML/CSS - easyJS - extremely hard
This course is very brief and basic introduction to spreadsheets.
While it is nice to get exposure to another language, it is more than enough to learn one at a time.2 - Add quizes and/or other well formed questions that are graded (automatically, not peer graded) to help enforce the concepts being taught.3 - Make the assignment instructions/expectations more clear.
Verry good job!
(Yes, the lecture on foreign fighters was more current.
It's too easy.
Very basic
I just do not give five stars because we have to pay to atempt pass.
It's must be any methods to exclude inadequate learners from reviewing.
I'm afraid I need to be a little bit critical with this one though:1) The contents are really jammed into 4 weeks - The last week's contents are actually some kind of miscellany between mongoose, https, authentication and BaaS2) Not a single quiz or self-evaluation of sorts along the course - To be completely fair, the exercises shown along the way might make up for it.
Im a visual learner and that would have been greatly beneficial.
The module was alright but I got bored halfway through
The issues would require more coverage, than, with some weeks, 15 minutes for the whole week.
I found the information in the videos valuable, albeit short and leaving me wanting more.
Though I feel more energy and enthusiasm by the instructors would uplift the course.
The course is really interesting and I found it really useful.
You need further sessions to learn a language completely and to have any significant benifit from the effort put in.
This course has very interesting programming examples and the exercises are really challenging.
Also - although it was positive to see the materials of the collegue and acfe sites, more was expected.
Several times, the assignment would pass in my environment but fail in the auto grader due to (incorrect) assumptions that the auto grader was making about implementation.
Overall, this was a worthwhile course but could use some improvement.
good for people who don't have any background about coding, and want to build a prototype of an app
The multiple choice tests, however, seemed to focus on trivia.
Also, the videos could have been quite a bit shorter.
Overall, I enjoyed this course, but it gave just a bit too much information on cognitive studies in other species, and it left me still wanting to learn more about dogs.
After I know how well prepared we are for next classes, I will re-evaluate.
Somehow this section is bit confusing or rather to say the content is not really enough to work alone.
Current structure doesn't make it possible for the learner to determine the speed.
Additionally, are non English speaking students penalised by having to write in English?
Great information but a bit boring.
A good course with valuable insights, however, I'd like to see more assignments
clustering, which I think are of great interest for researchers.
It should be part of R Programming.
For non-speakers of Spanish, the translations are not so great and sometimes lack proper grammar or are almost literal translations of the spoken Spanish version.
Some instructions of the programming assignments are not all that clear, which wasted me a lot of time.
Not nearly as good as Part 1.
I'd suggest a more organized video with less draws and annotations.
Lecture and assignments are quite detailed to walk you through it.
If/when it will be completed, I will try to find a way to share it with future generation of students.
This course fills a gap that is rarely taught by explaining biological origins of musical experiences.
Probably because I'm new to all the big data and graph analytics terminologies but the lectures in this chapter were quite difficult to follow in my opinion.
It may be nice for juniors.
The participants who put grades not according to the rules must be penalized.
This course is a refresher and provides a High Level overview of IoT and its historyas advertised
It is really basic knowledge.
And how to merge dataframes together.
Content is fairly good with weak story line and connection across the various modules.
Great ideas to improve the technical knowledges to scrapping web data
It's not bad but I think the other courses in this specialization are much better
I prefer direct eye contact rather than having the professor sometimes filmed not looking directly at the camera.
Good course, good introduction to Public Relations!!
Lecture videos are good.
There is not enough background information, no reading assignments.
The content is really good but the test questions are very theoretical.
Plus, its absolutely inconvenient when you provide one huge assignment for several weeks at once!
Lectures are too fast!
But all in all, fun course!
Good course, with general and not over-detailed explanations of all the relevant topics in data Science.
Thisis a really introdutory lessons about personal branding.
It would be good to suggest 'optional' prerequisite course if there is any.
This might explain the inconsistent grading of written assignments.
Easy to follow and well-packed with good information and tips, but I would like to see some kind of quiz-function along the course to test the knowledge I've been learning.
Also, it seems to me that they are delivering the lectures by reading line by line from a piece of paper.
However it would be useful to anyone who is interested in learning and curious about brain facts and psychology of learning.
I found myself having to rely on other lectures on python and book and internet blogs.
Very basic introduction and not thorough or mathematical enough.
In my opinion the course became too focused on the theory, where it could have combined the learnings of "Introduction to Game Development" with the principles of game design in a 50/50 ish combination.
However, if your sole purpose is the theory of games and game design, and you do attend the course in relation to the specialization, then by all means, it's a decent course.
there are few examples or interactive sessions and most of the time the instruction just speaks in front of a chicken cage.
The materials and pacing seemed all over the place - in some cases excessive time was spent going through quite trivial concepts, while elsewhere the course seemed quite rushed when looking at much more complicated ideas.
I audited this course.
I felt like the course was a little too easy and didn't provide much meat to the material.
Requires A LOT of extra research to complete if you do not have prior R experience.
Each week takes less than 1 hour to watch and it feels like an introduction of an introduction.
This course should be a free trial for whole specialisation.
Really just a "taster" to get you into the specialization.
better than my other courses
This class felt a bit elementary .
descriptions was not enough for me, the BMC concepts could be more elaborated by giving examples and explaining different types of businesses.
Such additions would elevate the level of the course and also help identify certain themes and events that often recur in art.
While U.
S. politics is important for many other disciplines, this course didn't have that much depth in my opinion to really be applicable on demands of international student and point of view.
The material covered is more complex than the previous courses yet there is much less explanation given.
The part of explaining Predictive and Inferential Analysis is confusing.
good course and good explanation by Prof.
Shiller but a lot of videos were edited like a few parts of the video were deleted.
I would have enjoyed more discussion of the history of modes and tuning systems, including more discussion of the Pythagorean comma (and how adjusted need to be made to intervals, especially in a chorus) and Kepler's work.
I felt like the teaching was fairly abstract, and I had a difficult time figuring out how I was supposed to apply certain lessons.
I also wish the videos were designed with better instructional strategies--the best Coursera courses (like those from Northwestern's Kellog School of Management) introduce material, expand on it, and then summarize the most important parts in each video--this helps the learner Here the learner is on their own.
But these aspects are probably the most useful when it comes to pracital writing.
It touched html, css, javascript, bootstrap and jquery most of part as just touched.
Not much content covered in course, especially compared to Aerial Robotics.
Great instructors.
Lots of historical references and terminology.
Also the lectures would have been more absorbing if they were not just slides with a wall of already inputted code (i.
e.
The information refers to the PMBOK very often.
I got a lot more background information from this course, and I think it is well taught.
Also, I didn't like that the example used was a memo for Coursera about their own course!
I really don't think these types of assignments can help students to learn Web technology.
If you are already a software engineer you could zoom through this entire course in an evening.
Really you can spend 5 min Googling the things you learn on this course.
Just three stars for the topic chosen Grainger, a bit to complicated and sometimes not strait-forwarded tasks.
Too few in statistics, too much in python and SAS.
Lots of good parts to the course.
kind of boring and I am not learning how half this info is obtained or why it is relevant to real world chemistry
I didn't like this course as much.
The instructor was actually relatively helpful, though the forum format makes for lag in help time, meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while (again...
outside study/research required).
It was a little difficult grasping functions as I didn't have much programming background.
I do appreciate that!But, just one question that I have is, why the deadlines for the Assignments are designed in such a way that Week1 of Introduction Course, and the Advanced (Object Oriented Programming) have the same deadline?
Too many ideas were quickly described and not really built up to my liking.
The information, videos, links additional reading do provide important information.
Figure out whether your idea makes sense to go to market
knowledge maybe you will miss more hand-ons.
Some more exercises using Github, maybe some collaborative works would have been nice.
This course could have been better in my opinion, if we could have exercise that would deal with the concepts in more detail.
Maybe this can't be helped, as all the camera's features, and their accessories, were described in detail.
The video quality was so bad, can not see the code clearly.
lots of dry theory, not as practical as I expected
It really detracts from the experience for those of us who come here to learn and not to socialize.
I think the course requires some basic statistic knowledge which I do not know anything about, it is tough to keep out.
Long, slow, rambling video.
It is alright but several people take advantage of the lax review criteria to submit one letter reviews.
Too general... extremely easy to solve the quizzes.
It concerns not only design, but also video lenght (for example videos on constructive journalism were way too long) and lack of a sigle thread going through all the videos and supplementary materials.
It was easy and enjoyable though.
In addition, these reading were not useful for me!
It says "shapes" and still people are not sure if they can use more count of those shapes.
The instructor's approach and enthusiasm are great, and the content seems fine.
Prof is a bit dry and need a new wardrobe.
It is theoretical, which is nice, but more practical example like case study would have kindled my interest to go for the certificate.
the equations/math could have been delivered in a much better way
I would have liked to learn a bit more about monads / monoids etc and I found the final week a bit disconnected.
Since I was auditing the class, there was no feedback for quizes of exercises.
Course is too simple, should be more extensive.
It was a bit hard to follow the instructions.
I wished the content and the tests were more challenge.
it's a basic course very focused on the mainstream music industry, it is very concise and worth reviewing, unfortunately you can not get feedback from the exams if you don't pay.
Not really clear step up from the scratch to android/java programming
Open an excel sheet can not be considered training ...
I enjoyed this course solely because of Professor Wright.
Well, it is a fairly good introduction to chinese.
The content is really an interesting topic that I'm sure a lot of learners with enjoy.
Very good course as a starting point.
Course was informative and a useful refresher but could have done with more worked examples in the tracking area specifically around value.
Typos in video lectures and assignment writeups are still frequent.
The second comment I have is .
4.
Good Course, but final project asks a lot for what this course is
The reason i rate 3 is that:1) Programminng Assignments doesn't realy correspond to the Lecture material.2) The Lecture material becomes very complicated in some Lectures because of Lack of Explanation (e.
g: Lec 4.3.
The course is good.
Probably more useful for someone with no background in programming.
An useful and amusing intro to Arduino
I do not think the instructors use the best/most clear examples to present the material to students.
Good for Beginners to go for.
Pretty basic stuff.
The lectures are all just the right length.
A wider grasp on things, additional readings, quiz’s, related articles, links and so on.
Only useful to people living in the US having extremely unbalanced diets.
The content was pretty good, but I'm annoyed that I paid for a disjointed collection of videos that were previously available for free.
I wish to have more contact with the academic crew.
The forums helped but I have the impression that they are not really followed by the mentors.
Some people may need more time just for getting to the right mood to learn.
Good overview of existing tools but more information will be useful to dig into the data world.
The worst part is R lab.
However, it would have been helpful to have some hands-on exercises like writing an executive summary, evaluating a resume, writing an elevator pitch etc so that people learn from each other.
Unsurprisingly I did not want to do this but would like to finish what was a very interesting and thought provoking course and the presentation was excellent and deserves 6 stars... the prof is a star.
Some of the problems I've experience would take more than just trying to find common interest and compromise.
A lot of conflicts arise from personal agenda and gain and that's very difficult to deal with.
good cource but its medical content about how to treat disease is low and needed to be moreand clinical cases is low alsobut another topics is very good
You need to have the background in the field.
I think the professor is very good.
I would say a fundamental course for VLSI.
I think i saw good tips but could be more infos.
I have to admit, this course greatly disappointed me from the beginning.
It was good but I would really appreciate it if MVC was tackled in more detail.
The course addresses quite precisely and pragmatically every aspect regarding young athletes anatomical and physiological development.
Includes advanced mathematics, I can only recommend this course to students who have a greater understanding of programming and math.
It is definitely beneficial to a certain extent but I thought that it was a little dry.
No math required.
Course material needs to updated to reflect current software updates.
I ended up watching 1 lecture on week 3 and again on week 4 -- none of the other lecture content was relevant to the exercises.
It seems like a ghost class without any real live students.
After the second week, we were expected to know what they represented.
Even those had some very unusual sentence constructions!
Some videos don't show what the lecturer is talking about, maybe there is bug or something, but there is only some irrelevant picture.
a live recording of the coding would have been more informative... like what is done in most other courses)
Thank you so much for the interesting course.
The quizzes could be more challenging.
Week 1 of the course seemed very interesting.
Not really in debt treatment of the subject.
Interesting enough, good start to the specialization but not the most content for a standalone course.
Informative
But the most salient thing that made my experience very limited was the fact that one of the instructors - the one that presented most of the videos, was excessively nervous and all that he did was read the slides, in most cases not doing so naturally and committing errors, rephrasing, stopping, changing speed.
Nice and clear course, but the level is not university level...
Also, the first two weeks could have been condensed down to one.
I felt if i was just to gain a superficial understanding then I would have browsed through any website/blog/article rather than paying for this course and coming here under his tutelage.
I would never recommend this as a first programming experience to a novice programmer.
Several times I uploaded material
In some cases, I had to translate the terms used to every day layman language to really understand the concepts as they would apply in my day-to-day work.
I enjoy shlmo's lectures but just wish some of this course "zoomed in" to me and seemed too "zoomed out"
It has guest professors who were very interesting, and I hope they could have give their perspective on the subjects as well.
There is no reading material, which is kinda sad.
This course is a good introduction to Health Informatics and medical standards.
The concepts are useful and the facts of the topic are communicated well.
Coding is introduced without a lot of explanation of Java Script syntax or methods or what actually happens when you write a line of code.
good, but no material and lack of structure
A bit confusing in term of structure.
Good info, but a bit outdated and dull.
I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.
Please be clearer next time!
For this course, however, I felt like I could have covered what was taught by myself with a book, i.
e.
Kevin Leyton-Brown parts).
Great content, horrible technical support from Coursera and the team that runs this program (since it is clearly obvious that Michael Mannino just recorded the videos and is not part of the class anymore).
The amount of materials is more than course period.
Still, I wish the explanation were more geared toward beginners.
The course provides a good insight into the world of Aerial Robotics and the dynamics involved in controlling the quad-rotors.
I still however feel the price is a bit steep compared to other similar courses you can find online.
The speakers know their information and showcase the different types of power and influence you can exert on people and they can exert on you, however, I believe it could have had more real world examples.
Content is good, but exercises could be improved, should also add a few interactive quizzes (e.
g.
Feel too short.
Although the Table of Contents serves this purpose in a more text-rich, visually complicated way - something I would find very useful is a step by step table or guide (to ensure no step is skipped) for the entire process, i.
e.
Requirement ActivitiesUse CasesWireframesStory Board developmentUser Story DevelopmentProduct Backlog Developmentand so on.
It repeats itself.
His graphs were overwhelming with information, and little effort was made to explain the graph.
Would have liked to have more assignments and content on imagemaking rather than a focus on making a book.
I WOULD RECOMEND THIS COURSE FOR EVERYBODY.
Week , on the other hand, was full of interesting techniques prsented in weekly homework and surely worth further investigation.
Feels like this course in the specialization was a bit rushed, compared to the first 3 courses.
The course depended in big proportion of the material of Rob Stokes.
The course materials seem very out of date considering how much things change in the digital age.
I didn't learn anything from these projects and found them annoying.
For example, I prefer the way modules are organized in courses 1,2, and 3: concepts with examples, practice exercise, then assignment through similar exercise + a quiz.-In last assignment, there was no suggested solution(s) for the last question, i think this is missing for a good understanding.
I guess that is why its water supply and sanitation POLICY.
The subject matter is very good, the quizzes reinforce the information instructed, and the testing is sufficient.
I would rate the course a 4.5 with the exception of the Peer Review portion.
And the formula bars in the videos (i.
e.
Since this is an introductory course, it would have helped if this were more interactive to build the interest for the latter courses.
It's a good start but needs more examples within the course and more projects to work on
While this course has great content, it lacks interactivity, exercises, peer learning opportunities and leaves desiring more real-life use cases and examples.
Doesn't enthuse us to continue the course.
Also another suggestion : assignment submission in other languages , especially R - the industry language for prototyping ML algorithms.
In terms of instruction, though, I find it rather exhausting.
Very interesting as lay person interested in topic.
The content in this course is essential, but the delivery is patchy and the course project is hard to complete with just the learning materials provided.
I rate this 3/5 because of how accurate it looks.
After also learning R from a non-Coursera MOOC, I find this Coursera course clunky and distractingly esoteric.
As a course designer it is a responsibility to set it right.
The excercises on the course are great, but the videos can be a little vague.
A whole lot of information to absorb, that I will definitely agree with!
Well presented, great communication and relevant content.
Dr. Saron noted that the results are not definitive but still may have implications for the compassion/bodhicitta meditations we do.#4: An interview on "Buddhist Modernism", with David McMahan.
I learned from it, not denying that.
And I know the course has the word "Introduction" in the title but that does not grant, in my opinion, to run a 4-week course such as this one with so little content
Lecture videos and slides could be improved in terms of summarizing the content.
Especially for this fundamental course.
In my opinion there are a lot of opportunities to improve the student experience.
Easy to understand.
It might not have the depth satisfy more senior professionals, but could be a good refresher if not.
Blacklists is only one way to stop them now.
It is quite interesting, but overall not very content heavy.
The lectures were done well.
Peer review is not best way to grade if requires some form of subjective judgement from people that maybe are not the very qualified to provide it.
Course doesn't seem to be of much use.
Many times the lecture becomes just a list.
Brian Caffo's lectures were rambling and confusing, with excessive use of jargon without proper explanation.
Thanks for the effort and the course is appreciated.
But I think sometimes it lacks a bit clarity, especially considering lecturer's English and bad quality of subtitles which sometimes do not match real lecturer's words.
I especially appreciated the clarity of Karen Ford's many lectures and Tim Newcomb's lively and enthusiastic investigation of the role of little magazines in the 1910s & 1920s.
Promise the cure for finding a job , but what did you learn ?
Tests could also be more challenging.
In itself interesting content, structure was difficult to follow and the history - in my humble view - was going back too far into the past whereas more recent developments where only touched at the surface, quality of slides was poor.
The videos talk about forums but there is no forum.
Even if a certain narrative is preferred by the teaching scholars, which is completely acceptable and natural, not just in the field of history, it nevertheless is important to cover different narratives fairly and as neutral as possible, which does not happen in this course.
It was a pain installing the necessary tools for this course for me on Linux.
Some interesting concepts are being taught, but the course is uneven.
All of the group assignments killed it for me, though.
there was too wide a gap between the lecture content and the assignments.
It can be more exhaustive..
Could be the best course on HTML5, but autograder is a pure nightmare.
It's OK, but not a revelation.
The vast majority of reviews for this course are glowing.
It was good, and i learnt a lot, but it vexed me that in the first lesson they stated you didn't need to read music to get on with the course, but everything from then on seemed to require reading music including an very difficult final test reading some complicated Beethoven apparently!
The professor has a tone of voice that is a little monotonous, but it was interesting to learn about memory with movies
You need to follow carefully what is being said - not a course to do while doing something else!
Too much bla, bla, bla.
Maybe because I am a med graduate already I expected much more from this course.
But a good foundation for the "Everybody" audience.
Good intro to programming.
Otherwise, it is a captivating MOOC, designed more for Photographers than lay public.
The "Experimental Design" video was the only really useful part and contained quite entertaining examples.
In any case, the course is very recommendable to start with neural networks
This course has some really good material but the way it has been presented is very disjointed and does not really do the job of properly illustrating Functional Program Design.
nor did I get much in the way of helpful info from the people who peer reviewed my work.
If you want a course that teaches you the basics from the true beginning but doesn't make you feel like you're an idiot for not understanding try Responsive Website Basics from the U of London & Goldsmiths.
An additional problem with exercise 2, is that the student is asked to calculate a particular percentage, but it is not explained what this is a percentage OF and there are several ways to interpret it.
Also the few videos with the other lecturer in week 4 are very confusing, hard to understand, or even appreciate in light of all the other material.
Interesting topic, but the course is not organized well.
The course is fun but the content is too general.
The material was ok, with clean presentation style.
I think its good that its given reference material for further readings, but this shouldn't exonerate you from explaining the details of the language, if I wanted to learn swift from apple's documentation I would be there right now, not here, if I'm watching your course its because I expect to learn it here.
After taking a Nordic food diet course where they talked about children's' diets in the Nordic countries and how they were changing the norm, this course covered the basics as to what and why certain foods are good for you.
Best wishes.
I was expecting to learn to use some tools during the course.
Some of the assignments didn't have a place to submit anything.
These topics should be explained better.
Overall, a great start - but can be better.
The course for me was very simple and basic.
Not much useful if you want to learn about IOT but helpful if you want to learn historical development that lead to IOT
Course was great.
The 4th and 5th are boring: it explains too many arguments in givin just hint to many of them.
Some modules are better than others.
The material is very useful, however, the second teacher is not the best...
This course tries to address problems that might arise from game development.
This course was interesting and informative.
I have some suggestions:1.
Contents in first half weeks are very superficial, have low depth so that do not help me do some meaningful studies.
It was looking as if some one behind the screen is just reading the slide content.
You should come in with solid understanding of the language - probably more than you would get from the first two courses of this program.
Somehow interesting course about Data analysis.
As a standard overview, the course is fine.
It is not clear enough for a greenhand to understand, especially about installing Git on Mac or pushing files to Github.
Nice course, but the gap between video lessons and programming assignments was too wide for me.
This also was a problem during peer review of assignments.
Thanks a lot!
5 starsAdvanced Competitive Strategy ... 3 stars
Not so relevant with real work.
Good content, well presented.
its all reading no lectures..
was boring
The time used on variation over the same topic in different models made it challenging to pay attention when the lecture finally came to a new point (brain fell a sleep while waiting for something new).
I really appreciate the attempt of the course; what I got is that we should trust good research and that claims need to be proved.
The content of the course is good, but it seems abandoned - some links are outdated or don't work.
It literally is like learning a new language : you need to keep reading and practicing and watching/listening to others do it until you start to get it.
The assignments ask you to list things that were seen during the course but dont´t push the learner to think and look up for further information in the topic.
What does that have to do with data analytics for business?
Many students were/are confused about the final assignment.
It is well structured, progresses quickly, and begins to contrast the sociological analysis with contemporary theory and critical approaches.
I can't seem to think of a good reason for this.
It gets a little redundant and some things are just common sense.
It was a bit frustrating to take screenshots all the time.
the course is great but i have problem with the assignments as they all have to be in parts and i can't get why we only submit last part as if it is right the others is right also, i didn't like the assignments system in this course but the course and the assignments itself were great
The instructor focuses too heavily on the US economy, which is partially understandable due to its significance, but I personally got tired of the endless supply of facts (and opinions) about US Presidents and their choices on US Macroeconomic Policy over the last 80 years.
Other than that, the main concepts of Macroeconomics are presented with adequate detail.
Prof Leek, has tried his best to explain the concepts in a lucid manner, however the complexity of the content, may challenge most students.
A few more examples with R code would have been helpful as translating problem statement to R code may not be intuitive.
I would highly recommend that students should plan to study some advance statistics before attempting this course.
The videos are quite interesting, though I think they are overly committed to very specific techniques.
Good.
I am highly puzzled about how it could be possible: if it is a free course for someone there are also many of those who are paying for the courses, and the courses also represent the University.
I think HTML5 and CSS3 courses were better.
Some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another (same purpose) or you spend our to manipulate a Pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications, except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement (for instance).
decent enough but this is a heavy subject and really it is not that interesting although clearly necessary.
Wish the admin address these issues through the discussion forums.
Unfortunately more interesting topics are only briefly mentioned at the end of the last video.
I am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding, but there wasn't any.
It is very easy and repetitive.
I felt that at times it was hard to follow where exactly he was talking about and what part of the code/function he was mentioning.
It completely lacks practice though.
I learned a few new things on this course.
The peer-review assignment is not properly designed.
It's really an introduction for people who are pretty much new to the subject, so I'd recommend it, but for people who are looking for something more, you might find it boring.
For the others, setting the playback speed to 1.50 improves the quality of the course a lot.
it had some useful tips on learning how to learn
Speaking about me I would like to say thanks to the lecturer , althought the I'm not very interesting in any kind of research , thank you for your time and videos.
The course is a good introduction to Organic Photovoltaics.
The assignments were not bad, but definitely took more time than stated (just keep that in mind).
Good course but it's too much academic, I can see that you were talking things you don't understand or read a script without put any of your efforts.
Purchase suggestions could be moved to an addendum.
The submission system for submitting assignments in most of the cases does not work.
Course design is pretty uneven in pace, engagement and expectation setting.
My opinion:Not much monitoring of the forums by mentors\instructors, hence responses are non- existent\delayed\misleading.
Very slow paced.
Several mistakes on the translations of the exams
The lectures are clear and of a good quality as well as course assignments.
Some irritating errors, but overall it was okay.
Some of the questions in the quizzes were very badly worded and I had to guess the answers.
The assessment materials are not free？ I mean it is totally make sense that charge for certificates.
On the positive side I emphasise the importance of bringing this topic to a Coursera course.
But the coverage of course is great.
Best of luck!
I would have liked to see more for the experienced person, this was quite focused on new college grads.
I prefer the Android specialization where the instructors are more mature and professional.
I feel that this portion of this course did move a little too quickly in terms of introducing new SQL concepts.
The content of the course is not explained clearly
They give great examples!
Most of the practice resources use Flash and one of the assignment submissions is inconsistent with the other submission formats.
I think, for beginners, it's a good job but the quiz is really hard to use !
if you already know what you want to learn and you don't want the the full specialization certificate jump into the other courses right away.
For most people this might be four stars.
Huge mistake... you start getting replies of EVERYTHING so... you can have 20 emails a day because other people are doing their "exercises" and posting on the forum, the worst is that is no way to turn off those....
Quite difficult to digest for a beginner.
Sometimes quite boring to follow the professor, but it covers the basics adequately.
The course satisfied me in various aspects.
Could be better.
Overall it's good.
I learnt a lot of new things about learning how to learn.
For me this kind of teaching is not very useful.
Week 2 on Global SEO was already covered in an earlier course by Mrs. May.
Thanks for listening.
Partially because of the Professor's accent and partially because the recording is poor.
The material was useful, and I learned a lot, but some of the specific lessons were presented in a confusing manner and it seemed like there was an overall lack of quality control (typos, missing videos, material presented in a confusing manner).
The other part that I didn't like was that the information doesn't really correspond to what you actually need to do for your assignments, I think the course needs more videos and examples of how to create the required documents.
I admit, I took a loot few times at the answers just to get my head around it and to understand the formulas and how to use them.
Overall this course has covered a lot of good and interesting information!
Could do with accessing Lecture Notes.
Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization, it's a bit of a bait-and-switch.
Some modules need to go indepth explanation but does not, especially on
Pictures of database diagrams need to be pasted in said documents.
In my opinion, it isn't worth $49 and is thrown in just to add to the total price of the specialization.
Halfway through the course, I gave up on the forums.
But I read all the poems, viewed the videos and took the quizzes.
In Data Science specialization this one is the one with most space for improvement.
Lack of transparency and accountability in addition to a lack of leadership is the real responsible of this crisis of credibility.
Is for this reason that its essential to educate people around the meaning of the EU and this course fully achieves this goal.
Most of the time in this unit that isn't the case but it does occur a bit.
Of course both speakers have amazing experiences and that is valuable in itself but I do believe the structure of the lectures is not envolving as it should be.
This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests.
If you have programming experience, this course is not very challenging.
My assignment in week 4 passed the end to end test perfectly on my local computer but failed the grader.
progfun and reactive programming was better
Clearly, the instructor is passionate about the Beatles (as am I).
Feel like it tailed off at the end in terms of detail and utility.
This course was a good refresher of mathematical and statistical concepts.
This course was very helpful but there is a need to discuss it more further in details.
!Summary: Take the course for it's content, and use the assignments as good practice.
In general, the teacher is very good, even though I found the javascript part less deepen.
If you have no programming experience in R, this is not the course for you,There is no link with the programming assignments and course slides.
But a practice assignment is proposed at the beginning of the course in week 2.
However, the contents and requirements of this course are too simple to be integrated as a whole course.
Alternatively, seek another course because it is very simple.
Overall good basic course.
This course is more like a brief to "how to design and launch a product into the market" with a case study of an app targeting to aged population.
Adequate course for non-professionals in finance, although I thought they were going to explain many more themes.. to short for my expectations and excesive for the price.
The content of the course itself is 4.5 stars.
This course has amazing breath.
This course is for the very patient, however, and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience, too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few.
Will probably finish the specialization, but wish there was a better way to be graded for the money.
Maybe we have been spoiled by the previous courses :-)
But this introductory course describes everything that goes into making web applications, from front end to back end and compares ruby on rails to the other major frameworks.
I found the first week to challenge my on-the-job knowledge of a fuller set of concepts and general terminology.
Cons: The wording on the quiz questions, in some cases, seems much different than the PPT slides and the instructor's language.
Thanks to the course, learned a few tips on online searching.
I hope further courses are more application oriented.
Interesting, although course content and test questions were very easy.
I would strongly recommend the instructor provide pdf lecture notes that we could save please.
It was much more complete, diverse and time-consuming than expected.
I think that , this course need to add more keys critical important point in each lesson by keywords on Videos.
I got some good advice from the reviewers.
At least the first exercises should provide a development environment to get familiar with: hex, crypto libs, dictionary research, stats algorithms implementation ...
The first two weeks lack of in-video tests.
Concise but could already include a basic proyect.
This is an ok introductory course, a compilation of concepts, related to sustainable cities.
The first and second course could easily have been merged.
It is also intimidating that questions cannot be answered directly and if you want answers you have to dig a little bit dipper to get exactly what you are looking for.
A good intro to the tools, but for anyone with prior programming experience unnecessary
It's just that the amount of effort needed to pass is minimal.
For example, the fifth week had fewer assignments than the previous weeks, and the six week was only a quick review.
The problem I have with these courses being so easy is that online courses already suffer from the widespread view that they're not as valuable as a "real" in-person course.
This course is a good start if you already have a little experience with CSS.
The content is good but I see some space for improvements in the structure and delivery.
I will certainly continue the course series because I enjoy the learning.
I only give it 3 stars because I felt it really lacked interactivity.
The same as I have written for the other courses in the specialty.
Unfortunetly I can only give a 3/5.
Definitely Not for young new front end learners .
Lots of things difficult to understand.
Cheri Alexander's inclusion of videos felt like filler and the notion of having to create a video as an assignment is time-consuming and ultimately not necessary to our learning.
Even though I am certain my answer is right, it never gets recognized as being correct.
I thought the videos and interviews were great but I would prefer these separated from the lectures on tangible material.
Pretty Simple stuff - but would've been better if there was actually something we worked on in a group, or an actual project to 'plan' or gantt chart to create.
A daily demanding course, which could have benefitted from more time spent in some areas - particular signals.
A good beginning to a promising journey
You will definitely have to be either a quick study, who can pull a lot of inference and practical application out of minimal technical guidance, or know how to Google the steps that were glossed over in the videos or for which no practice question was provided.
Very basic introduction.
Maybe this is the only way they can make enough money to sustain the whole... but the "more idealistic" start was far more pleasant.
In one place practice quiz has wrong answer marked as right.
There are only 3 quizzes where I missed just one question but no matter what, I can't get them correct.
However, if you want to take time to learn about yourself, it's great.
It's a long, but somehow hurried lecture.
That said, I liked this course.
The actual educational value of this course is quite high.
I like the input of historical references to help understand the material.
But I am stopping writing this.
If at least one of the lecturers find my review, please contact me.
Good to learn from the master but not very detailed and hands on
It was more stressful than anything else.
It seems these questions are asked before the lecture itself tends to touch the point of it.
Secondly, it was a bit difficult to associate the assignment write-ups to the lectures.
too easy
The problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader, which should definitely be improved.
I really enjoyed the assignments!
Before presenting this course again, TEST, TEST, TEST the quizzes and answers!!
Those lectures could just be tacked onto the description of each course and you would get the same thing out of it.
I think this course would be improved by more instruction on what git is and how to use it and maybe going over some fundamental statistical topics.
The course has intrinsic value, but as the complexity of the materials covered, the weekly slides were a priority to allow students to grasp better the materials covered.
The content is interesting but the professor is bad at lecturing (lack of structure, some rambling).
Even the subtitles fail sometimes to present what he says.
Hate auto grading.
i feel this course start is somewhat bored because of teaching is not practical based and better follow udacity website tech for teaching interactively
If you are paid learner, its better to get the whole specialization if you really want to get the gist of social media marketing.
Wouldn't recommend this to middle managers / data experts.
video of lecture doesn't add to presentation.
The Professors were wonderful, issues with wording of questions on tests and grading of tests
Very good information and resources provided.
The instructor Jack looks very skilled in iOS, but is not very skilled in organizing his thoughts.
Make exercised to be closely connected to the material given during that week.
In some the video froze, in some the sound went off, in others there were a problem with bot visual and sound.
I feel I got a pretty good idea of that and a better understanding the roles in an ideal team.
The course is ok but I found that there were some technical quirks that could be ironed out first.
The video are great and the examples too...
Very much a beginner's course for those who have not mindfully observed the game worlds in which they play.
I think the professors can elaborate better the course
Course seems under construction - many later lectures unquizzed?
This is a great course taught by a clever teacher but...
The content is presented in a very dry, not easy to grasp, manner.
Good course, but the SWIRL exercises (and a few quiz questions) needed to be updated for the latest version of ggplot2.
I asked for help a number of times, providing screen shots of the results I got trying to duplicate what the example was supposed to show, and page numbers of where the example was presented in the course materials.
And it's naturally a little partial in favor to jews, but that's only natural.
The course is interesting and the self-reflection activies are great opportunies to learn about yourself.
And another point that struck me was that one of the people who fell for me to analyze, was all in white and the person apologized for failing to do.
well organized but need more assignments and practical assignments
The lectures are well done but not up to the level of the quizzes.
I find it very tough to understand everything.
Also, it was difficult to see how the lectures connected to the remit of the course, to teach "reason and persuasion", in Plato's view.
Not much opportunity to work on your own content.
Very overwehelming with lots of names and without explanation, just like real lection in real university.
Weeks 4 and 5 did not give me any further interesting knowledge.
Not too much different information from what can be found in internet for free.
If it was cheaper the relationship cost-quality could improve.
Content on Ruby was solid.
Do not try to cover enormous amount of material during one week.
There are no TAs and the staff doesn't seem to be very active either.
I'm sure the course will improve in the future.
I did learn some new things, but there were times that I wasn't sure about the focus of the course:some of the questions are on the spectrum of too tricky-unclear, there were too many "find my error in the code" issues.
Plus, the last project (gallery) - which has many good features and ideas, does not seem completely finished from a UX point of view.
But faced lots of issues during practicing the hands on exercises and did not get proper feedback or response on any of the queries.
I found it to be a very basic course, instead of being offered as a separate course this could actually be covered in one module as part of the advanced level.
Might consider c
It addresses important issues and it gives a good overview, including some hidden gems (Machine Learning vs Stats, for example), but it feels mostly too rushed and superficial for my taste/expectations, and it fails to connect to my previous knowledge (and I have a PhD in Maths, although no strong Stats background), hence little added value for me when I cannot relate to what is being discussed.
student needs to read a lot out of this course in order to solve the exercises!the course materials are not enough, and they focus more on images, while this entire course for beginners level, it should be fundamental stuff.
overall the course is good but needs more changes
Very interesting to have a broad view of how marketing tools create value to consumer nowadays.
But some of them are useful.
Had some tech issues on my end.
This course seems great, although plenty of errors in the audio transcript.
I did not, however, find the assignments and peer review system very helpful.
I think there needs to be a course before this that teaches one what the first step of solving a programming-related problem; eg one that focuses on flow charts, breaking down the question, etc...
If I had to go it again, I would, and I also paid for getting the cert - if anything for career advancement and having it on your LinkedIn profile as a starter DB course.
Its a very small and easy course
You learn how to use git, rstudio, and other tools though.
And near the end of the course, we watch a white man encourage us to use more emotion -- specifically anger.
Would be more valuable to include 5 or 6 standard Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) by function (marketing, sales, operations, finance), etc.
These answers do not fulfill the rules outlined at the start of each course and I believe students not completing the Review properly should have their grades reduced or listed as incomplete.
This course was really good but not too deep.
Marketing Analytics in theory was much more enriching than this one.
They were too brief, and all the learning end up with doing the exercises.
I don't like that.
Visual and auditory presentation really counts.
Some step by step and some things make you think and research more references.
Very basic if one has already worked with software before.
It misses an assignment which will allow to practice the clustering skills.
It was difficult to understand the difference and importance of key concepts such as trie, suffix, class, etc.
If you can modify those two weeks, it would be great.
I found the Course very interesting, well prepared from the Tutors and I liked the case study Approach since it provides actual examples where Machine Learning can be realized.
I understand that material is not easy and one should do a lot of research and reading to understand the essence of the taught algorithms but the lecturer is also not very helpful and assignments are everywhere on the internet which nobody needs to get tired of thinking a little to do the homework as their product.
An ok introduction to Swift Programming, but I can see people who do not have previous development experience struggling with this course.
Content is really insightful, however, the instructor does not really dive into the details of most things.
Not really designed for casual interest, more likely for the philosophy major.
I was hoping for something that would be more practical for non-statisticians, but the lectures mainly devolved into mathematical proofs.
If there are some incentives or some grading can be applied to push people to talk more, it will be a very good learning experience to all.
Eg: Lorenz curve.)
Some of the lectures contain lengthy introduction and gags, which I am sure many students like.
You will have to do your own research to understand the definitions.
Gives the impression the course was not to be taken seriously, while, quite on the contrary, it was interesting and would deserve much effort.
I found the information dated and the exercises applied to digital marketing as a consumer first and foremeost secondarily as a B2C marketer.
No real great sense of achievement on completion.
assignment is a little bit messy.
[Parallel Structure]It uses some conjunctions like and, but, both....
and..., not only...
but also...[Sentence Variety]Use the different 4 types English sentence style, simple, compound, complex and compound-complex to enrich your writing.
Very tough, though very instructive.
A lot of links to useful information though.
While it was very informative, I would have preferred longer lectures and more material to read.
Learned a few things from this course.
The course felt mostly like one big plug to make money.
I give this course 3 star not 5 star because the level of programming assignments are bit difficult as compared to level discussed in lecture videos.
Good for novice developers trying to learn Java.
Also, there are references to statistics/statistical methods that the student may have no background in.
Could do with a bit of a technical overhaul as it feels a little clunky in terms of access to course materials and technical structure.
Photography is something I engage in almost daily with my iPhone, so I took a chance and was not disappointed.
Easy to understand with simple exercises.
Few talks with people from the industry, sharing their approach.
Not much of fundamental knowledge.
Generally great motivator to exercise Character Design.
not very useful
but it does not give any certificate of completion at the end as other courses do.
This is a cooked up version from an earlier, more extensive course.
Less is more.
It also allows the use of MatLab but the quiz questions are in Octave which means the quiz is not necessarily testing understanding of the course material as it is Octave.
Generally, the opportunities for feedback to Coursera are highly limited.
I wish the course was a little less conversational; however, I thought it was valuable and sparked new ideas, thoughts, and behaviors.
Need to include more real world scenario and application.
The problem could be related to the assignments but different enough to not be copied.
Introducing too many concepts (although basic) was not related to the programming assignments.
I was hoping to get some insight into problematic dog behaviour but maybe that was wrong expectation.
Learnt the basics of machine learning.
I wasn't able to finish the course
But the structure of the course is consistent.
A better name might have been "What is Data Visualization?
The contents of the course are definitely insightful and approrpriately based on scientific research.
Positive point: Excellent help on the forums, you will not be left alone.
The course seems rushed, there are not very clear explanations on certain areas.
Long videos aren't bad, if they are well put-together and conveying information in an engaging way.
The most weak part is automatical grading.
Very basic terms.
Rather than history of Recommender systems & what happened in the 90s, I would have been happier if the course was able to throw light on the latest stuff in this field, the latest mathematical techniques etc.
A good content should be supplemented with assistance to further enhance learning experience.
This was my second course of six.
They were basically memorization and regurgitation directly from the lecture videos with very little, if any, thinking required.
It's clearly aimed at people with next to no experience at all on writing and publishing!
It would have been good to have more assignments using more complex songs and asking for students to try soloing.
The professor's view of Plato is unique and interesting.
If the score was a 7, what can I do, in your opinion, to improve the answer?
The course content does not follow the exam question is totally different what you learn from the two-minute video.
But i feel like most of the course is just to memorize formulas without much explanation where they come from.
But I didn't see any "Practice" there...
However this course is aimed at teachers and that is not clear from the title and much less with the small amount of articles that are related to teaching.
It was very difficult for me to follow the exercises, since I don't have a programming background.
Good structure but a basic course.
It´s a good compilation of information about iOS and Android.
I think that some generic informations should be also consider on this course no matter if it´s iOS or android.
Some videos explaining the features like (gps, siri, multi-core processor...) would be good.
That helped me a lot.
So it's good for beginners.
I still confused with probability.
Also hadwritting isnt really helping.
course is too slow and the videos need some corrections
You have quality, but are missing the quantity.
The quality of the teachings was inequal in my humble opinion.
However, the course misses practical examples (not only showing the code in the slides, but also presenting how it works in R or RStudio).
As a neophyte, I found that there was too much material for the amount of presentation time.
I am an experienced programmer with over 5 years of experience in many languages including MATLAB/Octave and I sometimes found it uninspiring to solve toy problems, not due to the difficulty in using the programming language, but rather because after the assignment had been completed I felt I had not really learnt much more than I would have from just watching the lectures, although, if you are interested in getting experience with MATLAB/Octave, the programming assignments are good practice.
This is an interesting course but I'm disappointed at the lack of female lecturers/interviews.
Since I'm working on water modelling (computational fluid dynamics, programming shallow water simulations), I thought it would be fun to learn more about the political side.
A good introductory overview of data science.
As I cannot pass quizzes and submit assignments not having purchased it, I have less motivation to carry on :(
Thanks for your teaching and Sharing your experiences.
Ok, it's an introduction, but it could at least show us some math or pseudocodes.
The materials are well-prepared, but my attention kept drifting away from the content due to language impairment.
Even threads that deal with clarifying questions were not answered by the staff.
I understand that this way enforces community building and helping fellow students, but staff's participation would be highly appreciated.
Good teachers but a lot of questions in the quizzes were very ambiguous and unrelated to the Course Content.
i expected it to be more advanced.
It was a good course overall, but some of the material was very complex and would require more than 3 weeks of study.
Web Analytics demystified) was written in 2004 and as a result much of the information presented in this text book is very outdated.
Alas, in CS it seems the falling flat on your face so to speak is a preferential approach to learning in this field of study.
Its such a shame these highly intellectual people who create these courses forget what its like to start at the very beginning and the time it takes and guidance needed in order for a person to be able to feel like they are ready to dive in and give a topic like this a whirl.
Still, a fairly good overview of CSS3 for those who already have a little understanding.
I suggest including more practical examples in the videos in order to further understand the theory.
very very basic course looking forward to advance version of it.
Leve of difficulty was above my expectations.
Maybe too may different facts and not enough depth.
I really am motivated to learn some Chinese because it is like a 2nd or at least 3rd language in my city and very much a 1st or 2nd language in my neighborhood.
The course would be much better without that requirement.
I only received 1 feedback from the supposedly 3 each week for 4 weeks.
Tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing, but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesn't make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocating.
The videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology, especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily; green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors "spark white", and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it, which was downright infuriating.
It still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism, but needs serious improvement.
A good overview of the landscape of of IOT.
Unlike some others, it requires you to install Ruby from scratch (no VM with preinstalled components) and the final assignment requires you to do a project from scratch as well (no template).
This course is good, but I think should it be split in two parts because of density of material presented.
It is a good course & I am grateful for any one you puts effort into making education available.
Very slowly, very boring.
He doesn't even use other currencies in examples nor tests.
The first two weeks are focused on self growth, while the third is too focused on the company...
The provided materials are good, but in my opinion sometimes not enough to be able to answer some of the questions in the tests.
Hope to see more pictures.
The course lessons could have been more specific and provide more explanations on many topics that are later required in the assignments
The professor might be excellent in this field but simply can't explain well enough, he is mostly reading his notes/slides with a few drawings.
On the web (Googling), there are a lot of codes that allow these funcionalities and could be used and modified by other students to create their own Web page.
instructor is just reading out slides hence, it's not that exciting to watch the lectures.
Howeworks are way to difficult even for someone who has programming knowledge like me and the lectures doesn't do enough justice to prepare students for the homework.
Hello,The course has been designed in a way which can help a person who doesn't even know Programming.
Not practical for beginners.
Great course materials.
Found it difficult to form groups of students and meet up for the activity cases.
I'm missing mathematical proofs.
I already knew all the things going into it so it was easy to finish it over two days.
It should be a good intro 101 for those who have never studied mathematical finance.
Probably because I joined their first ever one.
In addition to providing answers to each week's exercises, further review of how the answer was obtained and the breakdown of the logic behind it would be helpful.
It is not enough to easily understand them without a prior preperation in mathematical details.
The student is allowed only one attempt at a quiz every 8 hours, where many other Coursera courses allow 3 attempts every 8 hours, which is more conducive learning and retaining the material due to the instant feedback.
we are in educational and science word not politic word.
A good start for learning game design and development
I am mixed on this class.
Overall a good and useful course, however:A) They could do a much better job regarding LDA, standard Gibbs sampling, and Bayesian model and inference.
A lot of them cut off in the middle and I ended up having to go to Youtube to find the full versions.
It is something I plan to continue, but not in the specialization offered here.
This course is designed for a complete beginner who doesn't have any idea what IoT and embedded systems are (and now that you're researching about a course on IoT you probably have an idea what they are) and as a guy who had already done some projects in this area in undergrad, I found the content to be very simple and lacking any new things to add to my knowledge.
But that's what I realize I lack and that motivates me to take the course from the first place.
It was very basic.
However, programming assignments are good and so are the Quizes.
Some of the videos are great, but they cover very basic: things like genre and narration.
Some of the exercises were not remotely useful.
I think it was far too easy to pass.
How can I be fairly marked if the reader of my work has English as a second / third language?
This can lead to the peer review grades being difficult to assign.
But this takes a lot of time.
Maybe the parts dedicated to test preparation and studying should have been shorter.
Interesting but very superficial I would say.
The course was very interesting and thought-provoking.
The final assignment instructions are not clear.
The voice needs to be a little louder.
I was rusty on that so I enjoyed it.
The "Second Course" was the one related with Analytics.
I give it 3 Stars because you can see some lack of preparation in the team.
Not much helpful course
And second, it seems like the instructor speaks with no preparation as there are a lot of stammers, tongue slips, "sort of", "kind of" etc.
The quiz multiple choice answers are laid out in an awful, confusing, anti-UX way.
It's a great introductory course, although a bit superficial.
You end up with a basic setup for the next class.
She noted that she and a noted clinical psychology (CP) scientist (researcher) (whose name I have forgotten) were at a conference where the issue on the table was that someone was having trouble with "loving kindness" meditation as a first meditation class.
There are 3 assignments the first 3 weeks, then week4 is an endless series of videos.
You can't have a "Music of the Beatles" course without playing some of the music.
As it was, I found myself frequently rewinding and squinting at the screen.
All that being said, however, I did feel that the course benefited me significantly, and I plan to leverage this knowledge in my work for PwC.
:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
I strongly dislike it.
And the code framework for programing assignment written in c++ is probably the worst kind of code I've ever seen.
Behavioral biases - like many psychological phenomena - overlap to some degree, and the frequently-used format of 'choose all that apply' - or worse 'choose all that might apply' - resulted in trying to guess what the test-setter was looking for rather than trying to apply the information that had been learned.
This causes a lot of confusion.
Peer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work.
For what it was, it was a decent course.
The functions are very poorly specified, and there are no unit tests.
3dhubs, the professors lab, Daqri, ....).
I understand that to understand better, we need examples, but I wonder if it could maybe be done in a different way.
Nevertheless, I learned a lot.
Thanks a lot for all the lessons!
As right wing and religious extremism in Israel and amongst the settlers has clearly worsened since Rabin's death it would have been appropriate to explained how it is now possible with a two state solution, and how todays level of extremism is likely to affect Israel itself.
I would have preferred a bit more lecture time, more examples, and a few side tutorials on using Jupyter and notebooks (how to download and upload), especially since we were grading the code of our fellow students.
The beginning sections of the course were interesting as they were descriptive of some pragmatic approaches towards thinking and learning like the POMODORO technique (excuse me if spelling is wrong).
It was a fast and easy course.
The high level over view of the life cycle of data analysis projects was interesting and overall this was a good introduction to the field.
The student enrollment was limited (compared to my other courses on Coursera) and hence the discussion forum was not active.
However there are a few issues :-a lot of the lecturing is on a board which is hard to read-there is a lot more science than there is PhilosophyThe latter isn't necessarily a bad thing, but based on the title I expected more of the latter.
As I was taking this class, I often wondered who the target audience was.
Rails coverage was very basic.
Needs some tidying up though.
I love the math.
But these are my personal metrics: A 4-star course has a high level of student collaboration and teaching staff participation, a 5-star course has very responsive teaching staff.
Not the best.
I wish there were a follow up one, like a level 2.
I also wish that Brian didn't refer to groups of dogs as "dog packs" as dogs are not pack animals.
I would expect less mistakes in english.
Could have covered more areas and with more examples for features.
It's possible that they may get some later, but I've felt I learned/got feedback a lot more in courses with TAs.
That said, this is an excellent introduction to databases course, and there's not many of them out there.
It ends up giving a quick introduction to some of the aspects of parallel programming.
Passing mark is 100%, it is tough for me and demotivating to persuade further.
That is why I recommend that course for those who is looking for a good HTML, CSS, and JS revision, not introduction.
The Course is fine, explanations and videos are a bit hard to follow at times.
The final assessment is in my opinion very bad, as it i appears to me quite unrelated to the course it self.
Assignment was having issue like incorrect and/or vague reporting which made them needlessly painfull.
However the practice relies a lot in code that cannot be explained like applets or mapping components...
Peer reviewed assessment with students who are unsure of the correct answers = unsure if solution is correct.
However, this is not a problem as all the necessary references are given.
Made it a little difficult to keep up.
It's like reading a book: nice but not up to industry best practices.
See the Wharton School Introduction to Corporate Accounting course for an example of well implemented multiple choice exams.
This is a good course for learning about the reasons, rules and methods of virtual instruction but I think some more interactivity and an increase in the number of in video quizzes would help.
More detail would have been nice.
Updated information materials.
The book looks like an abandoned project.
One course mentor could have easily answered all of them.
Compared with the regression course, this course was a slight disappointment.
Very light & not really consistent with the heavy workload of subsequent courses.
The course instructor could have been more elaborate with the examples.
Could provide a bit more of an economic foundation but the course is broad rather than deep.
He repeats points -- this can be good if done smoothly but it's very confusing when the lecturer is inarticulate, like the present case.
The content of this course is excellent, and I've learned a tremendous amount.
The last assignment we had in Course 3 was very specific and even had a video specifically on how to complete the assignment and why each step was important.
Sometimes I am still confused even after passing the quiz.
More structured, easier to follow.
Overall it's ok.
If you're a student and don't feel like you have effective, robust study strategies, check out this course as there are handy tips and tricks and some may be new to you.
good overview but not up to date and some errors in quizes
Lectures and Recitals were good, easy to understand.
The concepts presented are pretty basic, but foundational.
The course is awesome in terms of topics covered.
I only regret that there's no free Statements of Accomplishment.
At the same time this course might be just an intro to the series of courses about Business Analytics.
I learned some creative codings in html 5
nice to learn:))
There is practically nothing in this course to learn.
It is good for beginners only
The course has less weeks - only 4 as comparing to 5 in AT.
Good for those that are new to videomaking, and good for some classic movies mentioned in the course.
There is not enough exercise.
Can't easily understand one of the instructors.
I would like to suggest:1) to change the name in order to make clear that it is about the specific MAPS approach and not about "climate change mitigation in developing countries" in general terms.2) to integrate development professionals and some policy analysis / political decision making experts in the revision of the course but also in the MAPS approach in order to make it more effective or relevant for climate governance.3) to include (more) content about low carbon development and climate change mitigation strategies in some key sectors in the development context in order to increase the benefits for students interested in mitigation.4) to reduce the parte about the own difficulties of scientists and engineers when interacting with politics and stakeholders.5) to try to simplify the MAPS approach to make it more accesible to governments and regions in more poor countries.
I hope the feedback is useful.
If you are not going to be tested on the material, what is the point of all that required reading?5.
This is a good introductory course to some of the tools but it doesn't go into the details of R programming or Data Science.
It didn't cover as many topics as I would have liked.
However, the last module was disproportionately difficult, making it unreasonable for learners.
It focuses too much on bootstrap framework instead of in my view focusing on building responsive sites from scratch
This course cannot be labeled as intermediate level.
Another problem with this course is the peer review, the grading policy should be changed to punish irresponsible reviewers, no useful feedback got.
Somewhat useful, but suffers from what seems to be bad planning and a general lack of focus.
Thankfully, as with the graphs course, Michael Levin wades in to save the day for the last couple of weeks.
I think the teacher has opportunity areas in terms of keeping the audience engage...
Good introductory course.
However, it is in the same context with its specialization series.
Good but needs more assistance with the students.
it gets on my nerve from 3rd Work onwards
pace is slow.
Even then you only given the necessary breakdown of the math involved after you answer the question correctly, which doesn't help in anyway when you are stuck.
All this course did for me was help me find other courses which do a better job of going over the course materials.
Due to, sometime is difficult to advance when you don't understand a subject.
It would be nice to see more examples especially were we have too many formulas.
I was fearful that a course in Excel was going to doom me for the rest of the specialization.
What would be good is to include some analytical tools or examples of how exactly text analysis will help us find fraudsters.
You can tell the instructor is trying to be upbeat but is very clearly reading off of "cue cards" so it's a little flat.
This course was over all okay.
However, the lecturer sounds like she's reading the text, which sometimes makes it hard to focus on what she's saying.
Other parameter were pretty well and test question of week 3 were good.
It will be knowledgeable for all the web base students.
While the course materials themselves were very useful, the quizzes didn't feel like an effective test of the material and consisted of very few questions, which didn't leave room for error (especially problematic because some questions were subjective).
I finished the whole thing in 2 days ^^
There were generic discussions.
include some real time problems or natural phenomena while explaining a concept
She seemed as though she didn't know the material and is seemingly unaware of what is required for successful on-camera delivery of lectures.
Some of the presentation need to be simplified and shortened.
Using python normally, with graphlab imported, would be much better.3) (Positive) The lectures on things other than ipython notebook were fairly good, and I like how the specialty is structured with case studies.
But the theory too "empirical" and "metaphoric" for my taste, a little more rigor would not hurt!May 2016 - French student
The major value I see in the certification path is extensive feedback on the capstone project, as I thought peer feedback came too late and wasn't extensive enough to be valuable.
This is a good course.
The course material itself is good and you do learn a lot but for a course that starts at complete beginner level the final exam is too much of a reach for many.
A good introduction!
However, i've liked this course to review the concepts of forms and the types associated: radio buttons, combobox, etc.
Pity that people had to spend more time on making the plugins work than actually doing the exercises/assignments but good content nonetheless.
Why bother using them?
The original problems just seem not to count.
The course website provides estimates of the number of hours required to complete the assignments, but these were gross underestimates because so much about Matplotlib was left to the student.
Intended for Non-native English speakers, or English speakers without a strong literary background, 'Scholarly Communication' gives an overview of how to construct coherent arguments for academic publication.
There are multiple typos and presentation issues throughout the course; however, they do not necessarily detract from the content of the course.
One always understands what he or she is doing.
(FYI I was the among the first ones who take this series, and I have got 100% grade for each course ever since then.)
Not enough material though for a full course.
However, upgrade costs too much given the amount of materials covered and its complexity.
Very good course especially for math/cs students - a lot of focus is put on explaining the math behind algorithms and equations, so if you search for practical examples and use cases, maybe try to look for another course
Just a couple of topics are covered at a very basic level.
Why?
But the rest is very well done!
Appreciated the links to journal papers as extensions to the lecture notes.
I would have preferred more information on the ecosystem in which the critters dwelled.
However the course was good and interesting.
Especially since the presenters have another courses in the catalogue with similar issues.1.
And the assignments were also confusing and overly restrictive.
Level of difficulty low
Very well explained.
I would prefer to see the speaker during the lecture.
A nice introduction.
Good intro course for a total novice.
If the discussion forum was organized in a better way, it would have helped -- I had to scroll through pages of text to find the right tips to identify my mistakes.
I found this course quite hard to take to; especially after starting the second one on Character.
Prof. Susser, though, seems a lot more objective.
I thank very much the professors for this course.
I needed many more examples and exercises.
I found it a bit unclear.
Had to watch the videos over and over for some concepts (whcih is ok).
Since it is not interactive in any way, I am just spinning my wheels.
Homework assignments were poorly written making it difficult to know exactly what was being graded.
This course is good; but not the best.
A very informative course that will definitely help you to excel in your professional field.
I thought the instructors gave the information in clear and concise way which made the course quite enjoyable
the forum pretty active.
It is definitely good for the beginner.
Great course for Teachers or those, like me, who want to gain general knowledge.
Viewing the discussions, I was not the only one this happened to.
A good course that lacked practical information on performing a meta-analysis.
I am not from a programming background and still feel so.
Even in beginning, the logical sturucte is undoubtedly important for further learning.
And, Quiz are really easy.
Super basic!
Fairly good for beginner!
Very frustrating.
Very informative, and easy to follow format.
In my humble opinion, the Python ramp-up in week 1 is not sufficient to effectively complete weeks 2-4.
pretty cool course
Would've liked for assignments to be more independent.
The coding assignment instructions are near impossible to follow.
I look forward to their future course on Philosophy of Science, as I believe that by focusing on a more narrow topic, they will be able to go a bit more in depth.
Very informative but the structure is a lecture where the concepts are basically read from a paragraph.
very eye opening.
Not what I was expecting as part of the program at all.
There should be more visuals and discussion about what it is like to work in construction management.
pretty good!
They are peer-reviewed and I think the rubric used for grading is so strict that it doesn't allow the graders to interpret what we have learned.
They just throw all the material at you without giving you enough explanations or exercises.
Very informative, however a bit too detailed on the history of previous search engines and past Google updates.
I never used it before and do not understand why I should leave somewhere my personal data if I do not plan to use this service in the future.
A littler redundant when you compare it to the previoud courses.
The map part is good.
how to perform clickstream analysis), etc.
And the lectures should avoid general tips and guidelines (like "5 things to avoid in order to"... the web is full of this kind of content)...
However, by the review assigment i can see that the concepts were not clear, ther
Ha sido un curso muy interesante y útil.
There were more things that I didn't like and think that should be improved.
What I liked: Positive to see Illinois keep presenting specializations on Coursera.
I think it would be useful to have one notebook or cheatsheet with all the important functions.
The content is very interesting and I learned a lot about Design Thinking.
It may be more interesting if I have a dog to take part in these experments.
Found 1/5 of the content useful.
Interesting course and specialization.
Meaning that the lecture is comfortable and easy going and the personal work and reading is a bit more advanced.
I was really expecting a solid rigorous approach to the world of design thinking.
This course let me down and I just managed to scrape through at the end...
almost gave up.
I would like to know why a score was felt appropriate... if I received a 10, what worked so well?
But the quiz just made me feel stupid as I didn't have a clue on any of the equations and simulators I was supposed to use.
I want lectures from the instructor, not animation and slides.
Furthermore, I suggest that there should be solution hints for Quiz, because students will be frustrated by not knowing the answers and not knowing how to fix them.
The class has great concept but it needs a bit more structure and change to hit its full potential.
The Good:-The spreadsheets and exercises along with Quiz material.
Honestly, for something that says "Advanced" in the title, I thought it was a little too basic.
The course gives a brief but concise overview of Finance.
Didn't learn very much.
Other than grading correct/incorrect, there is no feedback afterwards.
The course is very helpful for those who have very limited time on their hand.
Perhaps a bit too basic (and thus boring).
For example, what are gerunds or infinitives?
(i.
e.
Sometimes I had to re-read things several times, and still wasn't sure what I was doing wrong (I realized that only after I managed to literally guess the correct answer).
And most of all grading is the worst I've seen in any course.
A bit 'light' on content but ok for an introduction.
Didn't get into the mechanics of genetics or molecular biology as much as I had hoped.
Finally, the course relies too heavily on academic writing for the hard sciences, rather than taking a broader approach, so some students may wish to keep this in mind when watching, as some advice may not be applicable to their own discipline.
Overall, a recommended course for ESL academics, but could do with some improvement.
While Professor Kaul's enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring, his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments.
In fact, most of the videos were too complex to understand without prior knowledge on the matter and the deadlines are quite tight to have time to research all the topics.
I believe the course content is quite interesting; but too complicated.
A clear, if fairly basic, introduction.
You have to use adobe illustrator to make the infographic and I didn't think the course did a good enough job giving the basics for that.
a lot of reading existing content, less from the master himself :).. was hoping to get more business case examples.
The tests however are focusing on nitty gritty differences or features in the presented videos.
I would have prefer a more historical approach.
Additionally, the instructor often assigns variable names that don't explain what the variable represents, which makes the videos a bit harder to follow than necessary.
In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.
If you don't know much about software management, this course might have some good info, but covers things you probably know if you have been involved in any software management.
To be completely honest, I was expecting more from this course.
Too much theories ,I hope the professor add more programming assignment.
Easy to understand and better with technological knowledge
However, it would appear that the real interaction is reserved for the later weeks of the course.
In fact, the requirements should just come out and state that you must have prior Scala knowledge to most thoroughly appreciate the course.
no one is here for review my work
Interesting subject & Basic idea to have a dog defined for the exercises is nice but w/o dog hard to benefit.
I've done the three prior courses of SEO in the series and they were extremely clear and have a lot of valuable tools and frameworks to work with.
The title "grammar and punctuation" is misleading in that only a few topics are covered.
Could have been more hands on.
I like initial courses like Exploratory Data Analysis but later on it got harder to follow the lectures.
It was hard to follow along with the lessons, because it was mainly present in formulas.
For the amount of money one is paying for this product, one would at least expect teacher-student interaction.
The weakest part of this coursera - are quizes - full of question, which check detailed facts from lecture instead of testing skills
One excellent example: Two trained pianists were told to learn a complicated piece of music, one with the piano, and the other only in his imagination.
However, the video itself is a bit boring.
1. there is less material compared to the regression course.
Each quiz took me an entire Sunday afternoon (My partner was not pleased).
Now here is where things get awkward.
Rather easy questions and not many difficult ones even in the optional exercises.
There are no assignments besides a final app.
I kind of wanted a little more from the class beside extended peer review time.
I have coded in other languages and found myself skipping the lectures and just reading the book and working the exercises.
some of the replies by mentors were misleading, The rationale of the Volt-sec balance was not set out very clearly, The expression evaluator is very temperamental, i had to enter the expressions many times , a very time-consuming & frustrating process.
This course showed a lot of pre-written code and exposed me to databases.
content is good and simple !
They could shorten a little the questions.
Also, suggest to reduce discussions centred to challenges (the course has taken too much of time) and more towards different new services adopted by different cities to capture benefits/impact to the city GDP.
On a positive note, the wealth of supplementary content is very helpful.
While I did enjoy this course, I found it to be less useful than the first two in the series.
Short and concise.
I want to llearn I wasn't aware there was a time limit to learn happiness.
Interesting course but lacks details and practical knowledge
Plus his sentences are so long and confusing.
Being updated with the more recent material would've helped more.
If that's how it works, I never want to pay for certificates.
Wonderful arrangment for learning.
The questions were just about the right level of difficulty.
Assignment Doings felt not that good as the courses before.
In 10 minutes I was given a crystal clear and logical answer on what is was all about.
He helped me a lot at the end of the course and his tutorials for gh-pages are excellent.
Make it clear exactly what format the programs output should be.
Overall I'm happy with the understanding of International Criminal Law that I have gained, though I am displeased with the biases I found in the professor.
It's OK to make the process as Stokes suggest but I think you can put more of yourself.
(Quiz 13 was the worst offender).
It is a good course, but I'm not sure it's simple enough for beginners - it doesn't teach you all the steps you need to know
Regards.
Rather elementary and slow-moving for my taste.
If you have some basic knowledge about food and nutrition, then this course is not the right for you.
Doesn't tell much about Android or iOS in detail except their features and comparisons
Lacks realistic applications.
Lot of sentences are changed halfway, making it frustrating and very hard to follow along.
As in part one there is a steep chasm between the final peer assessment and the presented theory.
I had impression that it was made rushed from shredded pieces.
It gives you a brief idea of finance.
There should be lab or hands one calculation exercise.
I really enjoyed this course and have learned so much!
Good but less depth than the rest of the specialization
Not really a beginner course.
So far , very interesting and covers much of the material that was covered in my Strategy Course in my MBA.
Not so inpiring
Although the lectures were intriguing and clear, I felt like the assignments were essentially "Go and pick up R on your own," which was pretty frustrating.
Nice tips, long for what you get out of it though
The content of this course is very good.
Finally there a lot of confusion with the deadlines.
Minor comments:Lucky Coursera has an option to play twice faster!
Nice course about eating suggestions and good recipesIt could be useful giving details on how making a diet for children, with information about calories they need and so on
This is a really basic course.
I hope this feedback is helpful.
The tournament model covered here was not sufficient to really address this issue and it requires more depth.
But it feels like it is not complete.
However, all the programming is graded by the autograder which has a lot of bugs.
The variety from the 3 instructors was nice.
Good course, catered for grad students but Undergrads can also benefit from the Reading material provided.
I didn't feel like he covered dog emotion at all.
It's not necessary for me
A little slower than the last ones, not my favorite but great use of hands-on projects and enagagement
Still, I think it's important to spread some quizes around so as to make absorb the concepts more effectively3) The quality of the presentations is somewhat lower than other courses.
Nice but only for those who search their first job.
I would recommend to build up from very basic stuff, and as the learning advances, going into more difficulty.
The hints for the assignments were valid in the the last lesson, but for another lesson, I think lesson 4, there was no hint.
Thanks
To fully grasp a human being, there must be a third way?
page 50 refers to the subset() function, but it is not actually covered.
Some of the choices for the contents of the course were, from the continental point of view, rather odd, though that did not make them any less interesting.
Although again very interesting, I found the lack of additional materials such as practical exercises, swirls and a book reduced the depth of the course knowledge for me.
But the way that the professor teachs is kind of boring for me.
Though I got 3.5 scores by two people ( not very bad）, I'm still frustrated, and I hope the assignment requirements could be clearer.
I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.
Stacy class, however is more practical.
It good for beginners who have no idea where to start in creating sites .
But, can improve some of the audios are not complete yet the audio has finished and in some of video are not completely organized
There are no narratives critical to british colonialism at all mentioned, instead of the White paper of 1939.
Just wish there were more moderators that were actively watching the discussion list.
), best practices for modularization and factoring, and so on.
lectures are too long, it lacks clinical correlation.
the course focus only technical lab issues, when you look for antimicrobial resistance course, the last thing that you need is tech theory.
The course is worth repeating
You will learn some basic python concepts, but you'll spend way too much time learning how to use this module which you will likely never use again, and this is at the expense of learning how to use some of the more commonly used standard modules (eg datetime, sys, etc).
However, too simplistic example and explanation was presented.
Overall, fine course, very practical.
Expect great interviews and lecture videos, but don't expect too in-depth of a course.
None of that was explained and if they were it was at a very high level.
Very compressed.
A bit too much useless mumbo jumbo, that can be concluded in a few sentences.
I hope the last two courses are much better covered and not just ran over like this this one was.
Very hard to comprehend for 6 weeks.
Those are cheap brainwashing techniques which target human cognitive abilities and subconscious to make their words sound more deep and convincing.
You often can see such brainwashing tricks in commercials and advertisements which try to elevate some concept or idea but lack any information or facts to back it up.
It was a little slow and quizzes were often frustrating due to questions and answers not matching up, or info was not given in the lecture.
Please take a look at it and try to make changes.-Udemy courses are more helpful, however i always prefer to learn with Coursera because of its reputation.
I will not choose this course if there are other python courses open at this time!
Updated and entertaining!
An easy start ;-)
A bit too basic
Good course, but need more details.
Each step is taller than the student.
If there are required readings, some of the quiz questions should relate to those readings.
The course was very limited, it should have been combined with Introduction to R.
Was not much informative.
The videos are really tutorials on R functions for machine learning and data wrangling.
I should go through the course again and I will be late for all assignments, so will have to wait for another course session... Very-very inconvenient.
And, yep, coursera reduce the effect of learning with not providing quizes for those who are auditing only.
Which is which???
Lectures were entertaining, but the assignments were way too easy.
Especially since the homework is checked automatically.
This was a good course although the assignment at the end left a lot of room for improvement.
But I think the worst of this course, and I wish Coursera would take care of that, is some quizzes being completely broken (missing or incorrect data), forcing you to go to Forums to get the correct question.
There are big gaps of data and no course biography to follow or complete the missing gaps (lecture resources, when available, is just papers on the topic).
It is indeed a good course, especially because of learning about UNIX and the GPIO pins.
I expected much (interesting) assignments and much more practice...
Interesting material but the instructor was so monotone and spoke so slowly, I had to play the videos at a faster speed to stay awake.
The Good:Very palatable content and provides information at a very slow pace for ease of learning.
More reasonable content and far more worthwhile than the first Arduino course of the series.
The Bad:Not worth the money when looked at generally.
Great introduction & analysis of concepts
There are too many assignments , not all can be done while living outside the United States.
I love the fact that this course exists, and it's a good foundation to build on, but it still feels too narrow to claim the title Positive Psychology.
I like this course it is very easy because of the trainer
Also the programming exercises quite often are detached from the material and also have references to materials that were not covered in lectures accompany them.
My advice to author - made lectures and exercises more self-contained.
Now I am debating on whether or not to continue to the R programming course after reading through the reviews of that course.
Too much of the content is already contained in the courses "Functional Programming Principles in Scala" and "Principles of Reactive Programming".
I think it needs some improvement though.
Interesting introduction to the topic.
The "Programming assignments" are very much like the exercise done in the videos - so no real thought and effort were needed.
It can be nice to walk through this process with a lecturer.
I did not like the way the materials were provided.
Cheers to the good professor.
Anyway many thanks for putting this together!
Thank you for that!
It was an amazing experience
Personally I already knew most of the information provided and I am a bit further into the 'eating healthy' process.
Do this course for the assignments and to have something that keeps you on schedule.
Maybe an attempt to make the lectures a little less 'wordy'.
With some use of either tv-shows or cartoons it can be clear what it means for the types.
Many slides on these 3 topics only contained some text and the instructor tried to "verbally" visualize the related important concepts.
Assignments don't always align to the course content....
In terms of usefulness and coverage of this course, this really is just the basics of R.
In the course, I prefer to see how the practice corresponds with the theory.
A bit easy.
I wish it was organized in a more interactive way.
IN SHORT: Better lecture slides with more information on.
I missed more details and exercises on the last part of the course.
in a word, help me a lot.
A lot of prayer and sweat I finally got it with a lot if discussion on the forums.
In my eye, "functional programming Principles in Scala" is this kind of real course that after taking it (it is not my priority right now so I will delay to finish it for a while).
The content and assignments are certainly useful and relevant.
It was ok for what it was.
Painful exercises with a lot of time spent on understanding the instructions instead of focusing on learning parallelism methods (especially the final assignment).
I didn't enjoy this course as much as the others.
The course will not be a burden on anyone.
It also took me much longer than the 4-8 hours per week advertised to complete each week.
.
However, overall the course is good, and I love learning other culture!
Also some links don't work and there is little or no interaction from the Course leaders or TA's.
For example, basic control structures of the python could been left out, just having a reference to material describing them.
It would help if there are case studies, practical examples.
But I wish the approach was more analytical and more hands on.
Could have been more challenging if assignments were little difficult.
Also, if IE is making an effort to become more relevant in this online space, it should allocate human resources to monitor and interact in the discussion forums.
My thesis in master was on Antibacterials and (and more subjects) I am much interested in Microbiology.
It's not exactly I was expecting.
of.
What I disliked the most: The way Scrum was introduced and mapped to the role of a "product manager" was very confusing.
Still, not a bad course though.
well presented, I would have liked more Information on teaching geoscience though
a bit slow but good for someone with zero experience
That's great but you're not really learning why and thus in my opinion I don't feel like I learned much about graphic design
therefore, the time to be invested for non programmers - especially in week 3 - is far more than the hou
I also wish there had been a way to ask questions regarding the material, but unfortunately, there was not, not that I could find.
The good thing is that course provides excellent resources for further exploring the topics in the course.
And I had stopped watching the videos because I thought I needed that access to finish the course.
Didactically I was a little disappointed since, as so often, allegedly innovative e-learning is based on a conventional transmission pedagogy, with the instructur delivering frontal-teaching-style lectures and the learner imitating the instructions.
Good course on Infectious diseases; rather broad which includes social and belief perspectives.
Good points are: the part on the "social networks" which enable the student in better understanding on the patterns of transmission; the part on agriculture and zoonosis and their impact on infections in humans.
Parts where I expected a bit more: the part on the "dynamics", mostly on the SIR framework (I actually I choose to take this course hoping to get a deeper and practical understanding of this type of modeling).
Some educational clips look like they are taken from Youtube or like promo videos for a certain initiative.
Some work needs to be done to update the pdf slides with what the professor adds in handwriting during the course.
Unfortunately, you will find at least one, minor or fatal, error in every video as well as quizzes.
This is a nice slow introduction to python web programming for those who have no experience or prior knowledge.
Sometimes I felt, this course was trying to deliver more content in short time.
While the overview of the content seemed very reasonable both in scope and pacing, the lack of swirl exercises meant that the final project for the course was a bit jostling.
USE THE DISCUSSION FORUMS IF YOU GET STUCK!
For instance, after three weeks I'm still waiting for a revision that I wanted to use for the final workshop.
I had expected more detailed course
What matters the most are your thoughts and views.
I enjoy the course but I already have a great deal of familiarity with Buddhism.
The course was more about CSR and philanthropy of businesses towards society which was not what I expected as the course topic as very vague.
Lessons learned can be put to practice immediately.
I learned from the lectures, but the lectures didn't prepare me to do the hmwk.
Simple to understand
Not sure I'm sold on this specialization yet, but we will see after the next course.
are not explored at all.
So I am soooooooooo confused.
There are some small hardships more.
it was too much teory and not really data analytics tools.
I have experienced several projects and find this course not that well match my expectation.
I just wish they didn't talk as much about what something is as opposed to how it works.
The course content is good.
The course contains basic informations on neural networks at a quite abstract level.
Content is good, nice details and the labs are great (although you can do these anytime as they are outside of Coursera).
This course has so much potential but is based on proprietary software.
This would really had helped me to better understand why something is done in a certain way and improved my understanding of how R works.
Examples too academic, needs to be more practical.
Why are there no links to the poetry we are learning about?
More assignments would help reinforce learning
Dr. Terry Sejnowski might be very knowledgeable but he can't read a teleprompter and it makes his videos very hard to focus.
Overall it was a good course
I think this course needs more emphasis on practical applications and less mathematical background.
The last two weeks focused too much on image functions and making.
The course is too easy to be called a course.
Generally good, but exercises in Week 3 & 4 have not been proofread and are full of mistakes.
Helpful tips, but this course should be free.
Course is helpful as a refresher to econ and business students who took some statistics in college.
Thanks.
Very basic course for those who don't have any basic knowledge
I did learn about some major topics of the DOM structure of HTML, so that was great.
My background is a degree in Cognitive Science, and I believe my review may be more specific to this perspective.
They ask for more than others and will get less.
I propose enrich the course with exercises and hands on
Easy to understand
There was some really great information presented, but mixed in with tangential and unimportant sources (I don't care about the fashionable aspects of IoT!!)
So I read the alternative readings but it clearly wasn't enough to get the quiz questions right which were obviously extracted directly from content of the Calhoun book.
I feel that the training could be more extensive prior to assignments.
I would have liked more of a discussion of the contributions of other psychologists like Seligman, Csikszentmihalyi, Peterson, Diener, Lyubomirsky, etc.
It's as if they just wanted to use everything, while never thinking about when it would start being too distracting.
Also, some USB guest lectures are not adequate for this type of course, which is for beginners.
Switching back and forth between Linux and Android is going to be problematic.
Good effort from Prof Stone in providing as much real-life relevance to the course.
Lean too heavily towards theory instead of practice.
It's a little annoying, because the videos are the same all the time... but the professor is very good, he knows so much about filosofy!
There are so many new terms, definitions, and ideas being introduced that it would help if these lectures also included slides or graphs with some of these ideas being broken down, as you would have in a regular class on a projector or on a chalkboard.
Frequently, the practice quizzes are just the same questions from the video lectures repeated over again, and offer very little prep for the actual quizzes, which are painfully pedantic for a non-credit course.
The assignments took me much longer than the suggested 3 hours.
As for me, I am going to spend more time learning and practicing JS/JQ before moving on to the next course in this specialization.
Great topic and content.
Could be completed in a day or two if you're just viewing the videos and answering the quiz.
Positives: The content is interesting and it gives you plenty to think about, and a decent grounding to go away and learn more if you decide to.
Negatives: First week doesn't add much.
Interesting insights into human interactions with dogs.
I enjoyed hearing about epidemiology, but didn't find the quizzes very useful.
I look forward to study with you (all) !Sincerely, Xavier Weydert
Nice course but be aware that this is at a very basic level!
The material was amazing (thank you!
Some of these questions are poorly designed.
I was hoping to learn more about food and how to optimize my diet so as to increase energy, improve mood, increase life-expectancy, and reduce chances for depression.
If I pay a Mooc, is becouse of a strong quality and substantial learning; this two lacking in this course.
More interaction with the enrolled students during the course and having more in-depth videos would make the course a lot better.
This in combination with the lack of response on the a lack of responsiveness on the forums might make this class frustrating for some.
I wish there was something more interactive than videos and multiple choice questions.
Maybe a simulation software or something fun like that.
A good clear examination of basic punctuation and grammar.
It would be better if the presentation material was bigger and the facilitator images smaller - you need only see a face, not the whole upper body in the foreground.
Nevertheless, I have been enlightened !
still i am unable to complete it and could not find out the reason.
I cannot rate the course higher because some of it is so out of date.
A little light on content.
Hopefully, these will be corrected in future offerings.
the material is too simple.
If you're looking for something more advanced than a very basic overview, you may want to look elsewhere.
Very well presented.
Simple and easy to follow
Kinda too slow in speed.
as a result, i found myself studying just to pass the quizes and not to actually enhance my knowledge.
Quick and easy.
The concepts and knowledge this course covers are useful and practical.
He also mentions subject in the course outlines which he is supposed to lecture about in the course but doesn't, or just expects you to learn it yourself.
Mentors are reallly of great help, they are doing a great job, honestly: they are very active, they give good insights, they know the subject matter.
But in the course lectures, there are occasions where concepts are used which were not formally introduced before their actual use.
One example: in the lectures on probability, the first "slide" in the lecture talks about random processes, outcomes of random process,... On the next slide, the notion of probability of an event is introduced, but the very notion of "event" was never introduced.
Good, but it lacks proper materials to come back to - slides are very heavy and not clear and transcript is missing connections to slides.
I struggle sometimes with tests.
If I gave it 4 or 5 stars, I'd be lying.
I'm sure this is one of those "you either love it or hate it" things, and I may be in the minority.
The instructor is not generally one to throw out some concept that has not already been learned and then just motor on without explanation.
Chuck Severance is brilliant in his ability to explain complex concepts by reasoning via analogy.
Week 3 assignment was the hardest I ever took.
Additionally, given that this is also supposed to be an intro to C, a bit more detail and some programmatic problem solving in C would have also added good value to the course.
*** DISCLAIMER *** I am not statistically significant as i only receive 3 reviews per week.
Advantages :Quick to earn cert, prewritten code available for easy use.
I think this class is best for academic people.
It is up to the student to figure out through stack overflow, youtube, and other search result to figure out how to complete these assignments.
They should take a minute to explain a little bit more what the examples consist of and what are the charts they show.
I would have preferred having an instructor review my work and provide proper feedback.
The course has its positives, but overall does not perform well instructing on the use of the two statistical software offered (SAS & Python).
It was great but I can't continue it because I am from Iran and living there too so I can't pay and enroll next courses :(It was just like a great starter with no purpose for me.
The initial course is too heavy in theory without enough examples or exercises to follow up upon.
This course is well worth a student's time and effort.
I found the exercises easier than the previous module, but the lectures were worse.
Overall well presented and excellent content.
However, at times, it can be very difficult to understand what he is saying.
I am sure, the professor is a great scholar and authority on the subject, but as a lecturer he is not that great.
Use consistent English throughout the course due to this is an English class.2.
The hand-ons were a bit helpful, but overall this class is more for those who already know about the subject.
At 2X speed it's very obvious and entertaining.
It was a fair attempt for their first online Coursera Web Development course.
Course is interesting, but sometimes its so hard to perceive the information with such accent :( I`m not lazy to read the subtitles, no.. but they also, from time to time work improperly and its not feasible at all to conceive the information .
All are different.
A student should take the maximum score if he does everything required, and he/she does it good.
It is impractical for people who have just been introduced to R(with no background in programming) to take up this course.
The graded assignments should be made simpler or should be preceded by smaller ones which help first-timers get used to coding in R. I do not think Swirl; even though a valuable resource; achieves this task remotely.
I'd rather have assignments for which you really need to change/write code, not just run existing one.
Some content on quizzes wasn't covered in the videos
Read more.
Very basic, very clear.
videos on constructive journalism)2) Structure.
There are no suggestions to topics to be discussed as well.
Lectures add very little to what you get simply by looking at the slides on your own.
Not enough practices for the unexperienced students.
Would be nice to have some new assignments.
Good ideas, not ideal execution.
All assignments are based on the creation of images from scratch, the modification of these images and hide messages in an original image.
excellent illustrations, although flashed up too fast.
Now, we are left to the good will of a classmate to judge our work and people are not even sure what the assignment asks of us exactly.
(And maybe Python programming, too.)
He used windows and in many cases I would run into problems like running Mongoid by including Gem files that he provided.
I liked the sample spreadsheets provided.
There is a lack of supervision by the instructor.
Design questions based on application rather than memory.
Hope to share more interesting video examples and reading materials.
It's good but depend only save informations than understand it
Would have like it more if JQUERY section was covered in more depth covering more examples and features.
Except that, the course is good and offers some cool tips on how to deal with that new ways of communication that we must deal of.
Certificate would be nice.
The less than optimal start could be trimmed off.)
I did learn the basics, but will need to go on and learn more in depth.
For non-native English speakers, this is very difficult to understand as well at time difficult for native speakers.
The Quizzes are very simple.
But really great information.
Pleasant voice, clear material....
but more basic than I expected.
The course was taken almost literally from the text book Emarketing by Rob Stokes, so the input given by the teacher was not quite relevant.
Volume too low.... need more concrete examples.
Thank you for your effort though.
need to be provided on the slides, otherwise students are either left to search through the transcript, which contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, or write what Prof. Gearey is saying which means continuously stopping and starting the lectures to get it all down.
Informative though - and an engaging teacher.
And for the final test, can this course give more test?
The course should provide a free statement of accomplishment if not a verified certificate
Nice course with lot of numbers and facts.
This resulted in frustration and made what should have been a good experience a very bad one.
Updated course to three stars since a change was made to be able to pass the final quiz without needing to pass the autograder submission.
Any internet troll could have taken the course and graded participants with the lowest grades possible.
It grabs the attention of the listener.
As an introductory course, the content was good.
looks good ...
lets see how much of help it can be to me Thanks coursera
Sometimes it was difficult to follow!
Hard to understand for people, who bad speek English.
Questions for peer review are bad:"Mark 5 if work amasing".
Interesting but too theoretic.
In a classroom (face-to-face) situation, the lecturer is likely to see and react to listeners' look of confusion; in a studio he is just talking to himself.
The application development was the positive part of the module.
2) for some reason the teacher is looking for my "rigth side behind my shoulders" and not "to my eyes".
The next couple of weeks felt a little shallow and rushed.
But rather it was the result of review of financial ratios and other other accessories.
Slightly let down by the forums, despite loads of mentors there seems to be almost no presence of the teaching staff beyond setting up a few posts to spark discussion which in reality just prompt short responses and no replies.
Which is fine because I assume he will go deeper into the material later on.
it is more broad than it is deep, and sometimes the videos and explanations were not the most easily digested.
I attempted the problems in the book before I took the quiz.
I feel like this course is great for introducing someone who has prior experience with writing music and using DAWs to Ableton Live.
It was fairly clear that these mistakes have been around for quite sometime, so I wonder why nobody ever bothered to update the code in github or update the bad instructions.
It was well presented but a little light on, I was hoping for a bit more "meat" to it.
Interesting case studies, but very uninteresting professor.
It should be called "Learning graphs with C++"
I learned some useful techniques
Unexpected lecturing dialogues.
It gives a binary output indicating whether you got the question right or wrong.
Good as an introduction, but not very hand-on course.
I loved the non-UK / American basis for the writing and the study texts: fascinating reads and great eye openers to other styles and languages.
The course is really interessant, I will like more practical examples to complement the theory.
there is a wide gap between the videos, practice assignments and completing the required projects.
Too shallow.
It's a good course if you want to learn about it and have a case as an example, not great if you want to simultaneously validate your own startup.
Because anyways, after 4 months in the specialization, if somebody continues to the recommender systems module for example, he/she would have forgotten the basics of this so they would need to cover again the recommender systems week in this course.
That's very little value for money.
The final course project again feels like it's done in a rush and without another review: The submitted dataset should be automatically checked.
Great case study, but the way to engage the audience might have been way better.
No pause between thoughts, no animation of any kind.
Some of the contents just seem overly complex, especially the videos.
This course is nice but very lengthy videos and at one points i didn't understand some topics , quiz are pretty tough to solve .
Some quiz questions are vaguely worded.
Slow start to week 1 but 'The Modern and the Postmodern (Part 2) is a continuation to 'The Modern and the Postmodern (Part 1) so best to understand (part 1).
Beginner course.
This makes the course less understandable.
It was an interesting class but the quizzes did not reflect the class material.
This course in okay.
everything you need to know starts here and its great, but the quizzes are so awful that I found myself translating it back to English to figure it out what the questions mean
the lack of assisted practices made it harder to digest the contents and methodologies.
strongly suggest to develop some practice problems with explanations.
This way students had an incentive to go over those readings.
I would have loved to view more of the controversial lectures that were referenced in the wrap-up.
The course release in 2012 would need to be updated.
I would have preferred more of an overview of systems thinking and less diving into the nitty gritty of technology.
There are many mistakes in PPTs and assignments.
I did the free part of the course.
Good course, but a bit simple if you have any previous experience with or interest in managing your own time.
The non-multiple-choice assignment (which involves analyzing a business plan) is particularly annoying.
Could be more in depth
Just a little highbrow.
The course content seemed to be rushed out, as a result, the quality is not as good as the first two.
There are many easier examples to teach about looping than showing an Ascii art example.
I don't want to pay for a course and have my points cut for silly reasons.
If you have experience writing (for children or else)
too simple.
Interesting course and worth doing.
I like the whole experience, but there are some gaps between sessions and weekly projects.
Very basic, the quizzes aren't clear enough
It was easy to 'complete' the course, but I have failed to implement its suggestions.
Overall, the contents are too fluffy and not very tangible.
Writing a letter, outline, etc.
Good material, ,but VERY sloppy in MS Excel handouts.
The course content of this course is not much and thus one can finish it rather very quickly.
The course was not that clear should have taught more in detail thank you
I hope this feedback helps to point out some of the problems that hinder virtual instruction.
Wonderful lectures with heaps of useful information including video on blended teaching in action along with teacher interviews and enthusiastic presenters.
I did learn a few additional learning tools that I plan to implement.
Interesting course, but recommended only for beginners.
Instructor speaks very fast so that i read subtitles instead of hearing what he say, in addition to i stop video more times to understand what he say, but totally the scientific and technical contents are great also his advises for us in which how we can find the answers for our questions about data science
I cannot sign up for the message board -- why can't we just use Coursera's built-in one like other classes do?
The legal debates might seem a bit pedantic to all but the specialist.
Please address content issues in a timely manner.
Standing in front of windows with the traffic outside may seem a minor thing, but it detracts form you and the content.
However, I had major issues with the translation.
In video questions are not very good and don't make sense often.
This course should be a 5 Star course.
It would have been nice if 3d computation problems were involved.
And here is the data to use."
Although the class has no listed prerequisites, I noticed a lot of engineering jargon being used without ever defining what it meant.
I also liked the graphlab module, I think that learning how to use it will help me with my own work.
However, as this course does not really go in depth in the algorithms themselves, I feel that after one month and a half I have a basic idea, but I haven't learned much about how to implement machine learning on my own even in basic things, while other courses have more or less the same time frame and are more dense in their material.
Most suitable for people who have had very limited exposure to spreadsheets.
The content is not as clear and simple as previous course
I was a little lost during projects, there no extensive videos for languages but on the other hand there was good materials and refereed links that could help.
so as a small business owner this course is not perfect for me.
The quizzes are way too easy, IMO.
I have noticed that some English translation is missing or is incorrect.
Also, since I am a non - Spanish student I can not review correctly and accordingly Spanish posted assignments due to language barriers.
I never did get an answer from the discussion forums, but I see the same problem in other Coursera courses I am taking.
However, I still think the course is worth taking, so I added back a star.
Basically if you take this course you are paying money to create an account on a website and download some software (both of which you can do for free).
I will rated number 3 because I want to learn more new stuff about protections of my body.
too simple(
This course was in some ways a disappointment.
Accurate , but very basic information.
I would appreciate it if some things would be explained in more detail.
Good practical examples of the concepts.
Overall a good crash course and introduction to R. Its a lot to learn in 4 weeks and some of the assignments were challenging (which I liked).
I had a feeling that the real teaching started only in the 4th week, with lots of walking around the subject in the beginning.
It seemed to me a little bit too superficial...
Please show the quiz answers for verification purpose since we have to buy the course to submit answers
The main reason is its title; it should have been "Macroeconomics of the USA".
It covers lot of theory part.
good learning with explanation on basic financials
Content is good.
Would like to use open source tools like pandas and sci-kit learn instead of proprietary tools like graphlab.
Good general guidance, Richard Sellers was the most useful.
It adds an unnecessary complexity to the course and adds extra skill set requirements which were not mentioned as needed ahead of time.
Without them,they were no help.
I had got my certificates for the other courses easily , not because the contents was easy , but was easily understandable and well organized and there was a great sense of satisfaction after getting the certificate because of the knowledge gained.
But unfortunately for this course , especially the week 4 and week 5 was lengthy and not up to the point and the quizzes were hence not seem to be related.
But its good to have the main themes and then go deeper in each one with other courses.
The previous writing course I completed with Coursera did not have such restrictions - you only had to pay for the certificate if wanted.
This is Excel, not Information Theory....
informative but somewhat redundant.
I really would have liked to have seen downloadable PDFs with the diagrams representing different models so that I could easily go back and reference them without having to find the particular moment in a video where it was shown.
How can they evaluate an activity written in such?
If it weren't for the lack of support in the forums, I would give it 4 or maybe even 5 stars, depending on the responses I would receive.
Either way, enjoy the course!!
Not as much practical as the other Python courses provided in this series.
Pretty basic knowledge.
Broken links for texts, typos, not updated data.
The course material was very interesting!
The part on the futures is not really understandable.
hiits a useful course but its too basic.
Thanks
On the other hand, there is a lot of repeats and therefore you will understand everything in the end.
Kind regards and thanks very much.
I wish there was more support on the project using pandas and sklearn.
It offers very few features (when compared to a DB).
Good, simple, straightforward, and applied.
I am aware that this is the intro course to the specialization, and I am looking forward to actually building the algorithms in the future courses.
At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code.
it's too basic for my taste.
It is needed to put more material or refer some notes or books that might help
I couldn't finish it without purchasing it, in spite of active participation and high scores on all the assignments I had access to.
Course design and objective of the course is good but the assignments were of sub-standard and can be really worked out to be better.
The subject is so extensive that it might be worthy to split the contents in two courses.
This course should have gone through the beta test before release to the public.
Hi team, I just had one feedback on the course content that there were some princip
The paper on Jihadi terrorists in Europe is from 2006, and information from the global terrorism database is from 2010, for example.
Also, i think more character recognition instead of focus on pin yin would've been more beneficial
The assignments should be flexible, i.
e we should be given the score based on what we have answered and provided an opportunity to re-take them if we have to improve the score further instead of having a strict policy of getting all the answers correct in order to complete an assignment.
Further the lectures were as though the faculty is reading out from a board in front of them (with an exception of Frederik Krebs), and thus many concepts were only touched on the surface.
And also some quizzes question were never addressed on the content.
Not that interesting
I have wasted my money on a specialization that I can't get because I will not, and simply cannot learn R. They should have made that clear this would involve programming.
This is a good course, and I would (indeed, have) recommend it to others.
However the week on science seemed to lack any references that i could find; unless i'm missing the obvious.
It gave me a level of understanding that I would probably not have reached by following the UMich course alone.
I would appreciate if there could be tougher assignments may be not included in rating.
The school is so dynamic!
If the content wasn't so amazing, I would have given even fewer stars.
Although the idea of this course is excellent, the reason I gave this course 2 stars is because of the logistical issues with the peer review process.
Switching back and forth between Time Value of Money and the Decisions framework can be off-putting, though.
A pretty good overview of modern poetry.
The video lectures provide a clear and concise introduction to interesting topics in machine learning (ML).
The first two assignments came, respectively, from those two courses also.
There wasn't as much emphasis on architecting a functional program as I might have expected from the title.
On the other hand, if you have programming or database experience you will find some topics too "basic".
I have liked it more than the first course on the specialization but I would expect more details (I think general topics are well explained).
Expecting more hands on experience with big data frameworks like Hadoop or Spark.
That should be pretty easy to fix.
Most of the information in the course are available online but still this course will help you align and organize your diet and exercise
I expected more math involved for a course like this but Shiller rather provided more of a historical account of finance.
The course content is a bit rushed, with some rather difficult aspects left almost unexplained.
And the programming assignments are just so-so.
Thanks to this course, i am now understanding the principle and methodology of phylogenetics
Still good though.
Just read PPT
VM is ok, but I think that docker can simplify all the stuff without necessary downloading, installations etc.
Looking forward to the next spark challenges :)
Very interesting course if you want to have an overview of how climate works.
The technology is treated not as strongly.
Very basic and the guy in the video was just reading out things on slides which made it boring
Its ok, I didn't learn a little and I didn't learn a lot.
But it's not so bad because the course took me less than 3 hours and I still picked up a few things :).
1) This course is NOT for beginners in R programming.
I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the "lecture notes" were not always very helpful.
The course is really good and the professor well prepared.
Very nice as a basic course if you have limited interest in math and just wanna start applying it.
There are important components like negativity bias and loving-kindness meditation.
This session was too long and a little boring.
This course was effective in testing what was learned and in testing simple, useful expressions, words, and sentences.
The course is far too much introductory and the practical assignments are not challenging enough.
The course lectures cover two distributions: normal and binomial.
I wish there was an active participation by the mentors on the discussion forum.
more content is needed.
Super costly.
It should be merged with course 1
I Felt like this was a very in depth course, the reading material was very good.
This Module was very interesting.
Some of the sounds are not good quality (mono - just on one ear)
Course material reference readings were good but videos were pathetic.
The content is good but the quiz and final exam are way too easy...
The course is given with sqllite, I would have liked a bit more experience with raw SQL queries.
It looked a bit like a phantom course
besides using random data would be more likely to make sense what the function is doing.
While the assignment itself is creative and fun to complete, I've never been a fan of peer-graded assignments so early in an introductory course load.
I know one can complete the course in more than a single round and I did that but I still don't think the expectations should be set for a single month.
Instruction (video content) can be much better, at least compared to a lot of other courses on Coursera.
Put another way not a CS course.
Your grades are based on what your peers (who are also trying to learn) think or interpret the correct answer to be based on their limited knowledge and discretion.
This course was helpful in understanding the basics of Julia, but there are still a few things I feel I'm missing.
I just hope next courses of the specialization will be beneficial for my career.
Not a bad course, but extremely basic.
I recommend U of Penn.
It gives a good idea about this market, although some of the ideas could be more systemized and clear
just a normal online course, the instructors are just reciting their ppt and prepared materials.
It is a great course, however some practical examples to try would benefit users
Course is good, but the material needs a bit of work.
How pedantic was that reader?
great content, a little long course for the provided content
Felt a little salesy at times, with all the monitoring products features (some which wouldn't work due to changes in UI or incompatibility with my computer).
the presentations are very hard to follow, it requires a lot of extra time reading the professor's book
I will want to learn more abou grammar so I can make sentences with sense alone.
I found the videos tough to watch.
The teacher covered a range of topics, but didn't provide clear frameworks or structures for how to deal with different issues.
The course was very informative and explained thoroughly and all but when you put it down on your resume or something its good to have a document backing up the claim.
A little bite long regarding the concepts number developped in this course.
The quizzes were simplistic, which is fine, but the final was literally just questions from the quizzes pasted together (all were repeats!)
After 3 great courses in this specialization, this one was disappointing.
I mean like more question in number or kind of test.
Learning calculus is hard enough without trying to grapple without some really tricky trig problem at the same time.
The assignments are the primary reason why I decided to take a MOOC instaed of simply reading a book.
Not enough guidance for final project.
Good course.
Very frustrating when you have tried to do your best but get no peer reviews.
This subject could be more productive if they'd go a little bit more into details on how to start and apply all the strategies they have taught us.
I do appreciate the hard work and knowledge sharing on this course.
It is in fact.
Lectures themselves were OK, but presentation needs work.
This can be unneccesarily misleading.
I've learned about some paintings and object, but the format of the course was weak.
I didn't like very much the two teacher
The course is good only for those people who have only started thinking about launching their first business
It is such a pity that payment must be made to access the graded coursework, preventing one from completing the course if one chooses not to pay.
Enjoyed the videos.
It addresses many relevant game development concepts, like programming, collision detection and 3D coordinates.
In general this was an easy, interesting and enjoyable course, Video interviews and lectures by key researchers in this exciting field were a highlight.
Thank you so much!
However I'm a bit surprised that didn't got a certificate for doing it.
THANK YOU!
There is much to praise: nice mapwork, a steady and organized march through time, and some interesting case studies (I especially enjoyed the lecture on Henry Adams).
However, the title is a complete misnomer, as the course is regrettably white bread history.
The assignment, however, is nice and challenging and requires people to understand the materials.
Also, the course covers other great packages than ggplot2, e.
g.
This course is designed for school teachers and, perhaps, for art museum's workers.
Repeated the same view，too much time.
I ordered a textbook, for example, and I was fortunate that it arrived quickly.
No meant of Social Science graduates without proper training in statistics/mathematics.
It strikes me as being pretentious, something to be discouraged.
Assignments flawed and need reviewing.
a little bit too easy for person who had basic knowledgement of python
It should be less repetitive and full of useful informations about applications.
For example Questions like why 7 hands needs to be replied.
That is not the case unfortunately.
A good basic course for positive psychology.
If not, give yourself ample time to install/configure it.
I believe that exaggerated the amount of minutes per video and lack of theory, but it was still a good course.
I happen to use the techniques explained in the course because they simply seem logic.
I think you have some great things to say, but perhaps streamlining those ideas and editing out the times when you need to pause to think (which is definitely legitimate when recording yourself!)
toughest of all , very tough
While the material presented is interesting, the lectures can be quite dull at times - especially later on in the course when substantial time is spent plugging numbers into the same expressions 3 or 4 times.
I know time is constrained in MOOC's and you don't get the full load of knowledge you would in a traditional school.
a decent introduction into the world of python dataframes via the pandas library
Maybe a course focused more on Shakyamuni and the basics of Buddhist teaching along with a few courses familiarizing listeners to terms might be useful as a preliminary to the following courses.
Wrongly assumes that it'll be easier for students to jump from the conventional 'parallel' java paradigms and constructs to parallel streams.
Not a good job on explaining why.
The final project was the only assignment in the course.
I truly don't know.
As the other first courses in the specialization, students would benefit tremendously if the instructors were a bit more active - the course feels out of date and abandoned.
Not bad for what it is to serve as guidance.
But for this one, I'm giving 3 stars, not because the content is not good (it is; it provides good practical and experiential information), but rather because the material seems repetitive at times either within the same course or with topics in the other courses.
Maybe not enough content to be a course.
Great Course.
Assignments were a little too "exercisey" for me.
I think it is ok to be nervous or at ease, but the team should alerted him to this, and shoot the videos again and again until they had acceptable and balanced quality.
A minor thing, I would like to had available the weekly slides to further reflection.
Explanations could be better and there should be more content on some topics for better understanding.
It feels like a lot was skipped.
However, I also found that it didn't give me the richness of principles and techniques that I've found in other courses in this sequence.
Steep Learning Curve.
I found the introduction to probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and their properties struck a nice balance between intuition and formalism.
However, it does get better at the end.
I don't find this to be the case.
There should be a way to rate critiques so that students can't move on if they don't do the work of critiquing well.
Obviously you get what you pay for, and it's great that I got a vague overview of the subject for free, but I easily aced the course without feeling like I'm at all prepared to run an fMRI experiment.
The final lab had an error that took a long time to find a solution for, which was disappointing.
But overall, I felt slightly underwhelmed by the course.
Also, the skeleton of code provided for the assignments had minor errors and the instructions for assignments were sometimes ambiguous or even incorrect as compared to what was actually required of the code.
I don't like the peer review.
More diagrammatic slides at the start would give learners a framework of the overarching concepts.
Because of the many perspectives presented each week, this course needs A LOT of time.
Funny and Intuitive explanations.
The Labs were fine.
So the course and the specialization tilts between very easy and very hard.
It is great to get to know the online community and the course needs more coding example directly relat to exams.
I do have background in OOP programming but not Python.
The course was a little heavy on actual mechanics and turbine output calculations.
This course was over my head academically and I was able to glean very little from it.
Sometimes it is more like a course about change management and looses connection to the Cloud topic.
Thank you for your efforts.
I was hoping for something a little more in depth.
The part I really liked is that there was no haste or a concept just superficially discussed - lectures are long and detailed.
I want more practice!!!
I am more of a written/visual learner and need to read to retain information.
Needed a step-by-step information sheet about what R Software and Tools need to be downloaded with links.
It was okay for an introduction to the methods, but I would have liked to learn about them in more details, i.
e.
Theorical Course.
Theoretical ideas of the brain are not easy topics; but it does make an interesting discussion.
I hope these are fixed soon because it would make this a top notch course...
Provides good basic information.
Some of the statistical concepts should have been explained better, but once you get past that, you appreciate the logic in the trading system.
Much more difficult assignments than taught in lectures
to basic
This course is great, instructor is good, however, the material of this course is not well organized, even the swirl practice is not put in the correct week, not in the same pace as the lectures.
Professors talk too fast and in an English for those who do not speak often difficult.
The gap in expectations and assistance is more of a chasm.
Unless you have the better part of a week free to commit to the course, it is advised that you skip ahead to the final assignment immediately and spread it over the full four weeks, spending the first week formulating the question, the second producing the classified raster and the third the model builder model, including any research necessary for this step.
The articles would benefit from including some of the images discussed.
I can usually achieve a score of 100% on three attempts before seeing any of the material.
Questions could be more difficult by requiring more discerning application of the principles, or by requiring true recall (typing in rather than choosing the information in a multiple choice format).
Week 3 was not very good as it was a quick overview of basic statistics which is incomprehensible if you have no previous knowledge and useless if you do.
I also find quite a few technical issues when trying it in the first termin.
Some problems and applications above and beyond the starter kit's intro guide would be nice and appropriate for the course.
The final assignment was challenging but not out of reach.
But there are some cons.
M. O Jackson is pretty clear in his explanations altough too technical, and Leyton Brown has a very clear way to teach, but I honestly got lost many times in the final exercises.
We jumped from some sections of the project life cycle to others missing some others.
So this should be covered or shared properly.
A little bit of more information on the course couldn.
I skipped many videos and found the same information on the internet.
I would have liked it to go a little more in depth.
Also, focus on the content rather than the delivery by the professor, and you will still be able to get some value out of the course (and the specialization by extension)
An interesting model of both what to do and what not to do in creating your own online course.
I think the remake from the original "Functional Programming ___ in Scala" + "Reactive Programming" has not been as successful as it should.
Very very simple.
People found various workarounds - uploading pdfs or Word documents, or zipped folders of images, but really, there should be some official guidance on this.6.
I think someone who has never coded before can approach this course.
Hey I even managed not to get full points for a "document is HTML/PDF/....".
Additionally, the cooking ideas / concepts were all practices that I already utilize in my own kitchen / feeding my own family.
This course targets mostly students audience, but not people with the aim of self-development, who passed their academic study long time ago.
Too long for learning so little.
Course material is a bit light, missing useful pieces of information.
Positive: It was refreshing to see this offering in Coursera.
A small detail - in part of the course page the course is entitled Oil & Gas Industries, while in another place is entitled Oil & Gas Industry.
A nice dovetailing of research topics covered to attempt to link measurable changes due to meditation practices while trying to maintain a good control group; not easy.
It relies on deferring to external reading materials as primary sources, and these resources were not specified in advance to secure copies in a timely manner.
Additionally, there is a big disconnect between the knowledge provided by the weekly material and what is required to easily do the programming assignments in the suggested time of 3 hours.
Overall the course material needs to provide more background material to be more effective in delivering the knowledge expected each week.
However, I would expect the subtitles/transcript not to have basic mistakes.
Jerry Coyne).
Furthermore, it sometimes seemed that rather than presenting the facts for the learners to judge, the lecturers were presenting their own views (this was especially the case in week 4).
This course is being funded by Templeton Foundation, an organization that promotes religious apologetics.
But, it will be more excellent if this course give a short quiz for each topic in end of the section.
It either is or is not a HTML.
Both test cases and feedback on failed submissions were woefully inadequate.
So, when yet another one of these online courses is incredibly easy to pass, it only adds fuel to those people's arguments and reduces the overall value of the certificate of completion.
I want my certificate to mean something.
More state-of-the-art, practical materials would help a lot.
I loved the course and content, but, found the process cumbersome.
I found some of the instructional videos a bit confusing.
Sarah Meister has curated a wonderful assortment of photographer artists that typify the historical and aesthetic advances in photography.
The teacher is very nice.
I rated it with 3 stars only because this course does not contain any information about chinese hieroglyphs.
Long, especially the week on Iran.
With a bit of work, I think this can be a very useful tool in writing scientific papers!
The course material was very good but the assignments were boring and unchallenging
can be more interesting :)
The time frame is difficult to keep up with, if you're not a full-time student.
Profiling was not useful in this regard.
This is a global course site and hence course structure should be such that every region could easily access the information and can contribute well in the assignments.
This was a fine overview however I was hoping to drill down into more detail on some of the roles and responsibilites data teams can have.
It takes a bit of work around to get to the final data set.
I had to complement this course with other JS open source courses only to realise JS is really huge.
Social media resources such as a linkedin group for the specialization would add value.
Asking people to cash out when a stock lose 10% is equivalent to selling low and buying high.
Easy to work through the Exercise Sets.
fairly easy, good for start
The professor could be a little more motivating.
It was a little long before getting to the REALLY interesting stuff, but it's a good course for what you pay.
If you are not familiar with JavaScript, I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering.
Not all of us are accountants.
As a beginner, I relied heavily on google and the discussion forum to get through the assignment.
No practical at least till the end of this course in this specialization
They seem more suited to young High School students rather than would-be college level writers.
The big issue is in the peer assessment process which forms the centre of the practical experience in the course.
The final activity needs more structure/scaffolding.
Some of the examples used and the assignments given were quite old dated that no longer exist.
Blaho
Ugh.)
Worth signing up for the course just to skip to Week 6 to watch this interview.#2 - Guided Meditations by Dr. Anne Klein and Anam Thubten.
to easy
I was surprised I actually anaged to get through the introductory module but by the end of the course I was less inclined to want to attempt the end of module project simply because the instructions did not really provided sufficient indicators that guided newcomers to the subject of programming but in this science field it seems that is the norm with many introductory programming courses.
Maybe the people teaching have forgotten what its like to start at the beginning and recall a time when they thought surely there is a better way in which to teach this subject that makes the connection between theory and practice and the relative interconnection much like bitesize stepping stones links a more plausible and achievable option for those unfamiliar in the field of computer science.
The final portion of this course (Monte Carlo simulations) was the most interesting part, as it got into the more statistical functions and the Solver applications.
Too bad I couldn't have actually learned something as well.
So many different visual backgrounds, sounds, music, text floating it...
Material generally interesting but felt a bit low bang for the buck, with much of it a bit obvious.
Very interesting but not practical
For people with not much background in organic chemistry understanding PEDOT:PSS and other chemical components we tough.
A suggestion would be to increase the class duration and explaining the concepts in a more clear way.
I do understand it is the first step in a full specialization but I think it can be more challenging.
Basic intro to Python.
It is easy to follow Kevins thought, but the discussion is quite superficial; no concrete numbers and examples are worked through in the discussion.
Most of the stuff they teach (at least in introduction) is very basic theory that's presented in not really interesting way.
I believe he knows the English language very well but, between his deep accent and speaking very quickly, there are a number of times I cannot understand what he is saying.
This was a little unfair.
to Python and then did all the quizzes & assignments for this class as extra practice.
For example: When would I use which method (for example rf versus naive base), the last exercise about cross validation was not fully clear.
More homework, at the very least.
I am glad that this exist but notice many errors.
It's very high level survey of best practices.
There is virtually no moderator in this course and the instructor does not grade or comment on the discussions.
Good course about getting the basics for the Data Science specialization, but a bit overpriced, as the content is low, and can easily be done in 4-5 hours.
The labs are well laid out.
Was really disappointed with this one.
Maybe Microsoft Project is a good example, but I am sure not the only one at first, and as I am a Mac person who has personal Macbook and Mac Pro at work I am not going to use Windows only for one application.
Or at the very least, the course lecture should mention clearly that learners are advised to read about it in the accompanying book.
The guidelines for the project assignment (week 5) are not all that clear as to what is expected from the learners.
It teach us how to run calculation in excel.
It provides many handy tools, frameworks, techniques for data-driven decision making process.
speak speed is little bit too quick, difficult for non-english speaking student
A good introductory course but it would have been nice to see a bit more of the math behind the models.
Tests and quizzes don't really ask the right things and the answers given are hard to understand.
I watched most of it at 1.75x.
The course content reminded me of my time a few years ago when I was enrolled in a Ph.
D. program at a major Tier 1 research university.
I found the monitoring tools a bit difficult to grasp in the time frame.
This said, I really think that the concept of the New Nordic Diet is great and should be adapted and adopted in other parts of the world!
That I found very useful.
The lectures are often superfluous and the professor keeps jumping from subject to subject.
The videos were very slow and many contained useless information.
its can get better but they need to add more advancing subjects.
The problem is that you're essentially on your own the entire course.
More concise coding tutorials and less "search on your own on the internet" needed.
For example, it would be extremely valuable to have resources related to Bernie Madoff, Armstrong, Edward Snowden to engage on a more dynamic discussion.
Good, but could have been a little more demanding.
If I needed additional information I would use a certain YouTube resource (thanks Bucky) because his lectures are so much more useful.
The coverage of functional reactive programming (FRP) was very good, but again, I would have expected more of a 30,000ft overview of how to design an application using FRP.
In short, I felt this course to be a little incoherent and disjointed.
I think you guys could give small scripts or asking smaller tasks to lead people until they understand how to build that.
Also has its positives, I really learnt great tips and technically I know a lot of R potential.
I found it quite interesting, suggest to make the lessons a bit shorter.
If there are no people available to help with producing the materials of a good quality you can ask people from trueowl inc. (the website is trueowl.
com and the working email is trueowl@trueowl.
com) to help with it.
If you are new to teaching ESL, this is probably not a good course.
I spent a good amount of time trying to fix my code, thinking it was incorrect, when in actuality the online submission was just not working.
The lectures from week 1 to week 3 are nice and useful to me, but I think there should be more details about the content in week 4.
Very simple, complete and usefulthanks
But it just scratched the surface.
I was a Vajrayana practitioner for three years.
Very nice course.
The interviews and course discussion are invaluable in this course.
I understand the the professor is attempting to provide an interesting and engaging experience, but I end up feeling as though I'm being talked to like I'm a child.
Each and every one of the films was priceless.
The course lecture was ok, Swirl was pretty good.
In fact zero support as far as I can see.
First time I came across grading done by students - it's highly unreliable and not necessarily fair.
Was hoping to gain a little more skill from the course.
I've been to college, so I'm not the target audience for this course, but I was curious to see what would be covered and to learn more about colleges today.
Lectures can be disengaging at times, the professor uses a lot of pauses which makes it hard to follow.
I think that the theory was very poor in sense of the videos were very short and with little content.
The assignment is very hard and sometime don't directly implement the knowledge you learn in that week.
They give you a bunch of code and ask you to complete it.
Pros:Basics were explained well.
A good kick start for beginners who are travelling towards learning Project planning and management.
Cons:Wish we had assignments to practice MS Project to a certain extent.
Some of the Quiz questions were confusing (Esp.
They just want to mention everything in very short time.
I found it very, very difficult to follow along what he was saying.
It teaches how to do participan observation, interviewing, storyboarding and heuristic evaluation.
However, I would say that some of the assignments were too simple in terms of complexity and there was few opportunities to apply the theory in the assignments.
In general I found the course useful for people who want to learn more about how understand better customer necessities, for design in general.
I liked it but I think it's a little too basic, even for me.
The course had some useful content, but there was too much time spent on USA centred materials for an iavailabe course.
The deep learning part is new, but it too short and lacks detail.
Voice of the professor is rather low key and slow.
I did take a bit away from this course, especially since I made more than one attempt to complete it.
It is challenging and requires effort.
Videos from previuos version of the course Reactive programming in Scala makes this course worse prepared.
jogesh mupalla should be more descriptive about his explanation, he should explain if not all then most of the components of the bootstrap coding , which he sometimes skips or misses, otherwise the course is good
It has good content, but there were missing classes to give more advices or clear any question students have, when grading peer review homeworks there were plenty of mistakes that would have been avoided if there were more video lectures or forums with teachers.
I live in I.
R.
Iran and there is no way to pay.
I suggest you to provide some prepaid card for Coursera, that we can use of them, same as ITune gift cards.
No one used the discussion forums either unfortunately.
A necessary prerequisite for the other Data Science classes, but not really a standalone course.
Very informative and rewarding.
I am giving this 3 stars for one reason.
However, the course is extremely basic and does not go deep beyond the high level concepts.
there were mistakes in the quizzes.
Not analytical enough.
What I like about the assignments is, that it is practical.
It seemed to just give an overview of each topic discussed.
In my opinion there is also too less tips for second assessment.
Even with all of that, I struggled to get my mind to think like a programmer and structure the thoughts into plans for the assignments and tests.
Good introduction, QSTK not an optimal tool and many of the things were a tad too general.
But it's a good start.
Because reading we can do our-self and lots of content are available freely.
And taking a look in the forums once a week or so wouldn't hurt.
Some questions are too simple and basic, and don't really prompt much of any reflection upon the course material presented.
However, it requires additional readings to be able to apply this learning
Easy to understand and follow.
But I believe the staff team should improve the technical aspects so students can save a lot of their time.
Nice course to understand the basics of graphic design
building personas needs user research, ideally).
A nice introduction but, just that -an introduction.
Will knowing the stages of emerging technologies help in the real world applications?
The assignments are not clear enough.
I found the second part more useful.
Some material is not consistent.
I found the initial videos very informaive.
Yes, perhaps I am not the best, but you are offering the course to people who are not born programmers.
I think that it would benefit strongly from a clear distinction between how to deal with vectors, matrix, data.
frame, etc.
without the forum, it would not be possible to make it in time.
I really enjoy the food preparation and the important facts about our body, about our food intake habits.
Good choice of project for the practical.
Many interesting coding practice tidbits along the way but needs polish.
I really wish the people who put this course together has taken the time to read and edit the transcripts of the video lectures.
The assignments were ok but I felt like they could have been more challenging and also that they should have tested my understanding of the course contents more thoroughly.
I hoped if there were assignments and games to keep us more engaged and to assure that we fully understand the content.
The course is good, but some gaps of information in the middle of the course.
There is a problem with the peer reviewing of the assignment.
Interesting topic, however the course lacks practical side.
It was good but little bit too fast, and not obvious, i suppose it would be better it was over 6weeks for HTML5 things only.
I did learn several new things and consider myself "introduced" to the world of python.
Some of the questions have wording and grammar issues that make it hard to understand.
A little too basic, but still good.
Indept videos and materials should be provided for this course.
It was a good course but kind of vague.
A nice intro course into what is a project and who is involved in a project.
We were given an example as to how to perfectly complete the assignment to extract the maximum knowledge from the course.
The teacher never ever mentioned that the first command is the most important one and the second is a kind of 'fallback', for example.
If an auto-grader or a way to ensure that everybody who turns in assignments will get those assignments graded back quickly could be implemented this would be a stellar class.
Just be prepared to spend a lot of time online reading, researching, and learning some concepts on your own.
The Paris Agreement wasn't mentioned, some of the research is from the early 2000s, many of the lectures are at least 3 years old.
The course probably should be a bit longer to go into more detail on certain things.
It was difficult to understand the underlying methodology of some of the concepts explained.
I wanted to know the components of the Integrated plan and not how someone was successful.
Had good information but hard to engage because the majority of the lectures are just powerpoints with the professor talking over them.
I definitely learned a few new things with this course but was hoping to learn some cutting edge tips on how to differentiate yourself as an artist with modern technology and how to build your fan-base online.
This course is of lower quality than the preceding courses.
I only found the interviews with Karen and Joseph to be of interest.
This is a good course, and you get an overview of a lot of interesting topics.
or applications of the course concepts to case studies would greatly enhance the quality of the course.
Still, it remains a very interesting and well dispensed course!
I'd like to know more day-to-day information to keep a conversation, I like how it started, but some instructions were not clear.
While people follow the spirit of the assignment, the grading questions may ask for slightly different or additional items.4 - Certain aspects of statistical analysis are glossed over and should be covered in more depth in the training videos.
Payment should only affect the certificate.
The course title is misleading because it does not cover any other data structures but graph.
For instance, signals / reactive concepts would be easier to understand in user interfaces or graphics / games.
Unfortunately, as a BRAND NEW programmer, it was, at times hard to keep up.
The course is good enough to learn a few concepts about techniques to improve the learning process.
I thought the content was interesting, but too basic to pay for.
I liked pretty this course.
The three stars are because the parts actually giving information had value and I learned some interesting things.
And other times too much special terminology.
It often appears that he is reading off a script, and sometimes his emphasis on technical details takes away from ease of understanding.
Good enough for a free course offering very basic understanding of the topic.
Interesting but not much practice despite the title.
As a software engineer I found this course a bit useless, but I do understand other people don't have the same background.
It could be longer to cover more aspects or more profound.
Also, the course for auditors is not very interactive and we cannot participate in some quizzes and work submission.
This course deals with Cloud Migration and change management.
Some good material and I good introduction to aerial robotics.
The last two weeks of this course held great information.
The video is constantly switching between the professor and the code.
its very good for beginners.
Covered basic elements of data science and statistics.
i wish more complex scenarios are covered.
We also learned how to create a predictive model, but did not go into how the model gets updated and gets retrained, an important aspect of ML.
The capstone project was too simple and not sufficiently challenging
Since it aims at showing the advanced and interesting things you will learn during the specialization, some of the practical sessions are way too advanced.
very useful ; but can be more fruitful
The course is a very quick run through of basic statistics and not very intuitive for people without much statistics/maths background.
Excellent content, but the instructor does not motivate
If the redundancy of information were eliminated, imagine how much more students of this course could learn!
Hope it will help you for future improvements of the course and/or other offerings.
Ricardo Oliveira
I live in a remote part of Australia where are no universities or public libraries which would have a copy of the book by Calhoun, and even if I had been able to afford the book it would have taken 6 weeks or more to get to me.
This course gave an overview of hiring and developing talent, but had far fewer actionable takeaways than the first course in the specialization.
In addition, adverbs, prepositional phrases (like in the morning), other transitions (furthermore) could be used to create variety.
One thing I really dislike is you can't take notes online while watching the video.
The assignments took me so long.
The student may come away with a few new ideas and the greatest value is in having peers review the homework assignments.
I dropped out of this course at week 3.
Room for improvement.
Videos are too short
If there were more research questions or problem solving homeworks that demonstrate deeply the understanding of the subjects that would have been great.
I am not sure if I will continue with the specialisation right now.
The course presents a clear structure and an interesting approach, including materials on the assessment of minorities.
I did not think the instructors were very engaging.
The course is great resource of information.
you don't have much background in the feild
You have to guess what the assignment is about each time.
Overall very good lectures but poor assignments.
Gave me some new and interesting knowledge especially in security topic.
The course is structured in an efficient way.
Assignments such as Red Laser should be updated considering the app has been shut down.
Homework was very nice, but strong accent of lecturers impeded me
Interesting tha
I did come away with some good books/stories for reading, but would have like them to be included in the course the way it is in the Setting and Description module.
There are critical organization issues to learn.
concepts were very good but teaching method/material must improve...
some of the materials and methods used are too unstable to be useful for professional use...
more work should be done by instructors to separate the 'reliable' concepts/info from 'interesting to know but not ready for mass use'
The lectures are great, there is a lot to learn from them but the assignments are a total bust.
excellent material.....
very good teaching..
However, the lecturer skirts around or hand waves away controversial or difficult subjects, and he's apparently afraid of offending anyone by getting too close to saying "fuck" or "sex" even in an academic setting.
Hope this can help.
I think that's a very good programme and a professional instructor .
Particularly the politics section in week 8.
For understanding many topics I watch many other videos on youtube till I grasp the concept.
Week1 can be explained better.
This is the only course of several that I have taken where this is so.
It may be the purpose of the course or the specialization, but I've been finding it too easy.
I am new to statistics and found most of the lessons difficult to understand, although I did pass the course and had taken the first two courses of the specialization before.
Some extremely interesting and thought-provoking material.
I went through 3 so far, and the ones from CBS are clearly the best I had (videos - content and speed - slides/ support documents, quizzes).
One could complete the course by purely reading the slides.
Just about okay.
Good introductory information.
Lecturer could be more interesting
The other sections you could've gotten from a Michael Pollan book, or one of his documentaries.
He talks to0o00o fast and His slides are too wordy and I feel so sleepy When I was watching these videos!
The assignment pages should be updated to properly include ALL requirements and an explanation of how to grade the assignment.
Just having the videos to learn doesn't provide - again in my opinion, a very engaging learning experience.
One big user-experience comment is that I wish that the videos had been edited; there are many long pauses and times where there is a lot of talking around the thing that you actually want to say.
I have been reviewing the tutorials that I am able to find -- and I have learned quite a bit of "how-to" information that this particular module does not provide.
Why is it that some of us who are new to the Fusion 360 environment have come to understand that we need to spend hours of our time to "fill in the blanks" of week 3?Are we to keep searching other sources so that we can learn what has not been taught in Week 3?
All was left to the guest speakers.
Also there were some english typos in some slides and in video quizzes that should be corrected.
Very Good content.
Just a format introduction to Project management, but good one.
The missing resources included instructors, mentors, partners, and learning materials.
The course site notes an expected time requirement of a few hours per week.
I really wish there were more examples for each bias (and more from the world of finance) because some biases were really hard to distinguish from one another.
it was a good course.
but it was super boring as hellthat's why I didn't continue learning the other modulesmost of coursera's courses as boring but this was the most boring
The concepts taught were very useful and interesting, but the only drawback I found with this course was the confusing nature of the Mini-Project.
The course videos are well made and insightful.
Lot of external links
But the course gave excellent information and I enjoyed it.
This course lost focus in later half and I nowhere I felt learning JS but just using JS as a tool to learn most of Image manipulation techniques.
Thanks Andrew Ng,
For example, one of the end-chapter assignments is missing complete instructions, and enough digging in the forums refers to, "a screenshot of the complete instructions".
The course is good but it has too much Chinese, and I'm not Chinese.
Interesting
Great course but the final assignment is really tough.
Things are way to deep for not programmers, i did not enjoyed so much as the previous
No songs, no music for fear of being sued!Takes a good deal away from the course!
A very basic overview of Egyptian history, not as detailed as I had expected.
But still I was able to stick to it complete it.
The videos were pretty goods.
The speaker is very good, your english is clear and easy to understand.
please improve hand-out for self study.
Content is too easy
Not clear examples in the videos.
The quizes do not match a 100% with the lecture videos.
Why not show examples of Dogs doing the games, that would be great for people who do not (yet) own a dog.
A nice introduction to the three plotting systems in R. The second part is devoted to clustering, but it is not detailed enough to be really useful.
There are times when one can take a quiz and think, "How exactly does this relate to the lectures I just saw?"
And I think part of the learning process is get to know here I'm falling.
But it was an alright introduction to machine learning but not enough if you want to know what makes the 'black box' work.
5 star for effort.4 star for content - some of the findings are open to debate but are seemingly portrayed as "truths"0 star for trying to obtaining personal information (name, email) under the pretext of assignment when such information are not required for completing the assignment.
Gives a basic overview of data collection processes.
Probably, this course could work for children with low level of math and zero programming experience, but otherwise it is waste of your time.
The ideas are good, but I dislike the presentation.
Most analogies I come across are misleading for all aspects of a thing but their very narrow scope, and sometimes the thing itself too (after all, you usually make them when you're first learning about a thing, unless you're teaching) and so without knowing how to make good anaologies while they are good for memory they are on average bad for understanding, and I don't think that can be stressed enough.
I watched all the videos, but did not do the coursework.
I was a total beginner on the subject.
Good course, very education
The course was well designed and coordinated.
At first the questions were wrong, but i contacted with the professor and he corrected them.
I'm kind of disappointed with this last level.
Few good ideas, too much repetition of the obvious.
Got really bonkers listening to the University of London jingle at the start AND end of each of the 38 video's in this course.
3. the math is more handwavy compared to the regression course.
OK but was expecting better.
I was looking for more hands on FHIR when i took this course.
:( given the high standard of the other courses in this specialization, i'm sure it will be better next time....
Because people decide not to do it.
The goal of a teacher must be to make students love the course\matherial\science, not to hate it.
good introduction for people who have never do anything with programming.
You can't do it free in a practical way, which on principle excludes people.
I feel like I should only have to pay to get the certificate or maybe a final project review.
Overall, I really liked the idea and content of the course, but not how instructors approached the self-learning part.
The use of graphlab doesn't make it better.
It is good, but there is a student speaking that is really difficult to understand.
test gods, lady luck, that zombie talk, and the discreet mention of evolution as THE fact - referencing to Charles Darwin as some great intellect).
Having done an MBA in business I as expecting more in-depth teaching on strategies of various business and how their creation of value to stakeholders.
The course is short and very appropriate for beginners but not in-depth knowledge, however it still does create valid points on businesses role towards society at large.
Lastly I did like that all course material for all weeks were opened and thus one could progress through the course faster
So, please teach more stuff and help students to make most out of it.-The assignment was really challenging and interesting too.
A free book to read would have been nice.
The instructors share good insights about the need and motivation for various ML techniques.
But the so-called "Chinese version" doesn't fit my need.
That was very informative and motivating course.
I did still learn a great deal of vocabulary.
It´s good to know how to clean the data but it´s confusing when Q1 is apparently correct but actually it´s not.
Week 4 could have been split in more sections.
Good Course.
I would improve this course by adding more technicalities.
Also, the length that is needed to complete the assignments vary widely week to week.
Students be more interactive.
Peer reviews was unfair.
A good substitute for "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng in terms of managing data sets and exploratory analysis.
While I enjoyed the projects and found the instructor easy to follow and understand, I was disappointed in how little coding we did.
Third, it is repetitive and there's too much focus on the unnecessary, the lecture needs to be reviewed.
The python text appears and disappears too fast to digest, I did a lot of pausing.
The early exercises were good, but later ones were finicky.
Use the course forum extensively — only there will you get a hint of how to do what they ask.
Google and Stack Overflow: that's their extensive list of references.
Some videos had some echo problems with the sound.
My rating reflects the lack of high-quality content with more examples.
Though familiar with the material, the lectures made several very nice key points about the Philosophy of Science which I found useful.
It's too easy for a dedicated programmer or IT person, but there are some obstacles to a person who are not familiar to the Javascript programming.
I enjoyed the course but I would prefered it to be longer.
But I consistently felt unprepared for applying it in Octave.
The audio is poor and frustrating, which the course addresses in the first week by essentially saying, "deal with it".
That was very disappointing.
Moreover, the structure of the course is not as good as the other module.
I mean - how can I not get full points there?
Pretty basic stuff but you have to take it to advance to presumably more interesting material
The comments are at times too casual.
To be fair, character is a sort of amorphous subject to begin with.
Im glad I god new knowledge.
I wish you guys could implement a little R interface so we can follow you closer.
The last project quiz demands you a huge amount of time, if you do not have much experience.
The many errors in the quizzes and the basic structure of the course - like having no link to a textbook in a central location - makes the experience of the course very very poor.
It almost made me quit using bower forever.
I wanted to learn and practice building more functions by applying the basic information to do complex tasks.
Very Useful
I was expecting something more advanced.
Basic overview of Typographical ideas, terms and so forth.
It's probably fair to say this course offers some experience in the elusive skill of how to think like a lawyer.
I wish there were another conflict specialization on Coursera to choose from.. one that is more modern, up to date, interesting, engaging, less patronizing .. etc.
As a PwC employee, I felt that with greater attention to the quality of the materials/lessons, this course could have presented the firm in a better light.
More specifically, in those videos where the instructor typed out formulas for the first time, this could have been done more slowly and using magnification.
It is possible to pass by doing the assignments with e.
g.
This part of the specialization should be free.
Also the title of the course looks incorrect " the Humankind's".
the final exam file not being available) had obviously not been fixed since the last version of the course.
There are only a few hours of content across the five weeks.
I had to start at a more basic (high school) level and work my way up.
Course content was nice.
The lectures are much better than Module 1 BUT still too thin on information required to complete the final assignment.
I think this course is great as an introduction to behavioral finance, however I think the content lacks depth and is rather superficial.
More like a 3.5 to 4?
A lot of interesting examples are provided to illustrate the different points and various experts are interviewed throughout the course.
The course could have benefitted from assignments being more consistently accurate to lessons as there are some gaps.
It's quite interesting, but definitely not a beginners one.
There is a tremendous time lag apparent between essays being submitted and being reviewed.
With Cheri I feel bored.
After week 4 hands on part, it became obvious we will not see how to implement or interpret the more abstract graph concepts presented in week 3.
Not useful by itself, but grudgingly necessary to get you ready for subsequent courses in the specialization.
The course is interesting and well taught.
But I don't feel like it's helping me become effective at using them.
Others have commented on the rapid pace.
Even in the professional world of data analysis, I have never experienced the lack of support that I found in this course.
With that, I am giving it three (3) stars.
On the other hand he's also very clearly biased bordering on utopic about the benefits of capitalism and glossing over a lot of the down side risks that are inherent in finance.
Would have been four stars but the final quiz was excessively difficult.
Only the first or second lessons have information about nutrients and how they are different from each other.
This bring a lot of overhead to us who are learning.
Some videos seem to have been re-worked over time and present cuts or jumps.
As for assignments, they should be better worked because some questions are not clear or misleading regarding the criteria that you want to evaluate.
For example, I already reported that in Question 2. and 3. of the assignment for the 3rd week.
Almost nothing relevant to start working, but fine.
The lessons get a bit confusing, and so does the questions from the quiz.
Jeff Leek's approach is more calm and simple.
Nevertheless, the course in general is really good.
And the charges are soooo unbearably high for college students.
The course presents the topics in a non-linear manner.
But I did like all other aspects of this course, including the Taco Bell insight, as well as the details on Social Mention and the other free web applications that is more pertinent to future social work.
pivot tables, index-match, vlookup etc.
lectures were a bit hard to follow (esp the mathy ones) - i'd suggest reworking the blackboard craft
However, the process of receiving peer reviews on exercises was extremely frustrating and detracted from my overall satisfaction with the course.
Otherwise the process was a good real word application of NGS processing.
More schematic description could help understanding the course much better.
Very informative - but I don't like the dry delivery style.
I resubmitted my assignment that day, highlighting the content the graders missed.
There are some useful information, however there are also some drawbacks, especially not clear criteria of assessment of final project .
Not very satisfied with the assignments as they are suited for graphlab
Professor nor your staff reply the forums.
Fun introduction (I have no background at all in Epidemiology or related fields).
Musical intros and outros on videos waste too much time.
Excellent content undermined by technical problems.
And the teacher/professor explains it so well!
There are a few mistakes here and there in the lectures and the quizzes.
The formulas are interesting and
Maybe not mandatory but in addition to what already is there.
Hate the music.
One suggestion, make this course a little harder by introducing some numerical problems or making the course with some more depth.
I enjoyed the course but I would like some more guided work before facing the assignments.
The course gets better for week 3-4.
Helpful instructor.
Many of the videos were so poorly done (boring) that I couldn't watch them.
Loved the professor.
Pretty good information.
My point is, give credit where it's due.
It is introduced in the accompanying book, but if it is the case that the book chapters should be read PRIOR to watching the course videos, that fact should be made clear.
Further in the course on probability, some words are used "interchangeably" without the context making it clear why they can be used interchangeably.
The course is pretty uneventful.
It could be more elaborated.
It also has a nice introduction to the very basics of C Programming.
A few mistakes in the lectures and some bugs in the scripts of the programing assignments that you need to manually correct, but not to bad.
Lots of helpful information and tools to use were provided from this course.
As a summary: the course was interesting enough to be passed through.
Thats a good course for beginers.
In my opinion should be more illustrative with more real and nice examples.
As I progressed through the weeks, I found myself becoming less and less interested since I already know the basics of memory and psychology.
The Professor is excellent.
I had been hoping for more complex recipes, but there were some differences to my dishes that I already make which were a nice change.
Should be updated to use python 3 in my opinion since this is for new python users.
The lectures and resources are good quality and offer a lot of information.
Apart from that, in some videos the audio quality was rather poor and the instructor seemed to have caught some cold or something.
Good introduction.
So in THAT regard, I give this course extra stars.
I found that I was frequently looking on the internet for additional resources and finding that I was definitely not alone.
It needs some serious work to make it a great course.
Some of the material is overly subjective (giving rules for academic writing that are not necessarily applicable).
Especially when you make a small correction, and have to take screenshots AGAIN, then paste it AGAIN, and upload AGAIN !
You will understand what we know but most importantly what we do NOT know on the subject.
This course is indicated to anyone looking for an overview of Python programming.
it was very simple , but i expected more content
This was actually pretty hard.
My advice to students in a similar situation is to look for other sources of information as well and try to experiment with your code as the lessons go by so you can really grasp the meaning of the pieces of code you're writing.
Good for beginners!
If this is the case, some outside study/background research may be necessary, at times.
But either way, I felt like it just taught you to install stuff rather than actually teaching meaningful material.
Almost no new or useful information for me.
It's a good course to learn about data structures for beginers.
The language and explanations are very very simple.
Very nice and interesting subject.
Some questions ask what answer is "most correct" which implies that there is a strong element of subjective judgement involved in its formulation.
However, I found the Week2 project a bit confusing even though I was able to solve it.
First I want to thank very much the instructor in the online forum.
And includes very little the combinations of different disciplines like Computer Vision, NLP and Data Science.
Lo recomiendo para saber como América Larina funciona en estos momentos.
The course is aimed at teachers and art educators, which was not made at all clear on the course info page, apart from a single reference to the 'pedagogical framework'.
1. please the instructor speak loud and clear.
Some lecture not really much with the results of assignments.
The last assigment provided more information and more hints.
There is a huge gap.
Similarly I may have to busy of a lifestyle to have properly focused on this class.
More practical exercises should be recommended.
The content is interesting but the videos are quite long.
However if you are hoping to actually learn about the topics, you are going to have to work very hard.
Did not find it really helpful ...
may be the way I expected it was different.
I have started this course again and again.
I got understanding about the big data, cloud and CDN.
So various important data structures are not discussed.
This stage of the course i feel could be summed up to just one week worth of work.
There were some great lectures included in this course, but the emphasis on the content we were not receiving was a bit disheartening.
Every week it has lecture slides, articles about the week.
I think the microbiome is indeed a hugely important field, but the level of hype here, and lack of any critical perspective, was off-putting.
Too microsoft-oriented, too much reading (sometimes not very related to the topic) that is not unique and can be easily found on the internet without attending this course, not enough video presentations and explanations.
Final exam seemed to me a bit out of topic.
Interesting and enjoyable; but I was looking for more of a rigorous introduction to Plato.
The assignments are really good though, great projects for sparking the creative process.
I would suggest that you brush up on that before being comfortable with taking this course.
That's a good maintenance practice if you cannot afford to buy 2 sets of strings every month.
Maybe a good addition would be that guitars/instruments can also be rented for relatively cheap, instead of having to spend 500-1000 before even knowing what to look (listen) for when buying a guitar.
To me the questions until now were a bit too easy but that's Ok.
The instructor is warm and seems pretty interested.
Content is way too minimal though and it's not enough to prepare the student for the assessments.
A lot of searching is required in order to arrive at the solution which more often than not is not the most optimum one.
Didn't learn as much as intro to game dev'.
The course is made for managers who want to get on the innovation wagon.
It depends on you, whatever you study or don't.
Also if I benchmark against the top specializations from Wharton and U. Michigan (Business Foundations, Business Analytics, Leading People and Teams and Finance: Valuation and Investing) all of them pack a 1.5 to 3 hours of video lectures.
It says the same things over and over again, just in different words.
It's still a very good course, and it motivates you doing to do something with great values.
It seemed to me that it is a good introduction for someone totally new to the topic.
Is there really any value to seeing the professor (rather than just hearing)?
The lectures could be augmented by breaking them up into more pieces (particularly for Instrumental variables and double difference).
Hopefully I will get some of that in your Calculus Two course.
It take me a lot of time to understand videos and still I'm afraid I'll forget the things as soon as I leave it.
good intro to the very basics.
And analyzing the exercise, I realized it was necessary to have knowledge of financial ratios of profitability and a certain familiarity in the hotel industry.
Some course materials should be provided other than basic fancy power point slides.
I really enjoyed listening to the lectures.
The course content is great.
However, some info could of been better explained.
This negatively effected my grade and the grade I gave to other people.
Can't get score for free!!
I can not got more messages to completed the homework.
So I will Unregister this courser , Thanks.
useful but boring!
I thought it was going to be an all online digital strategy for pr.
It does improve my decision making skill.
I personally think that I've learnt more from Google and YouTube then in this course.
Details on how to implement code on any java platform using inbuilt java libraries and several others.
A little bit too much generalist, need more precision.
And unlimited attempt for quizz is not a godd idea, because quizz don't mean anything
I recoomend to remove this topic and focus more on solidifying foundations so that students can be more prepared for moving through the whole Algorithm Courses.
I would have also liked some hands-on assignments.
But the assessment process was very frustrating and led to a lot of wasted time debugging that was geared more to quirks of the grader than to course concepts.
Few doubts because of this remains unclear and I wish I could have got this sorted in this class.
Pretty weak teaching - "maybe you can place objects in this order, or maybe in this order".
Additional research on my own turned up a wider variety of PM techniques that were not even mentioned.
Overall, worth taking, especially as a very basic introduction for those who (like me) had no previous PM experience.
I was forced to look for other resources like Open Courseware Algorithms course, and this is how could understand what was dynamic programming easily.
For a guy that sits in IT business for a while it's rather too simple.
Presentation rather poor.
I thought, really, I signed up for four months of this?
David Germano’s lectures are full of information but he doesn’t help the learner to make sense of it.
It was a lot of topics to cover in a 4-week course.
I learned a lot from the kaggle competition.
So much theory can become boring at times.
Great content but animations are annoying!
50 % margin for passing the exam seems too easy.
The staff people try to help but I totally don't understand their approach in that 'this may help but I am not sure if the autograder can accept it'.
I would have loved to have more on the other styles as well.
There are examples in the course, but they are far removed from being concrete applications.
Sometimes, I got confused because of overlapping materials.
The teacher is excellent as are the video lectures.
Unfortunately, the new Coursera rules requiring payment before assessments can be accessed meant that I didn't complete any of the assessments.
The only setback I had was during the purchase of the course.
hard to follow.. usually I don't know what is he talking about..
It did not feel as though they lived the material, just taught it.
It would probably make more sense if it was titled "Project Management Capstone Project" or "Project Management Capstone" or similar.
Not useful for professionals.
Also if this is going to be a series of courses wouldn't it make sense to bundle it in a specialization?Nonetheless, congratulations and thank you for presenting this course in Coursera.
Simple and accessible introduction to Machine Learning for people without strong Maths and IT background.
Eventually this assignment became grinding with Java's verbose, annoying syntax and unnecessary computations designed in lab instruction.
Anyway worth taking along with other courses from that specialization.
The swirl practice modules were great but I wish they constructed some lessons that would build a function from top to bottom like we were asked to do in the programming assignments.
This is a very helpful course
If it wasn't part of the specialization I wouldn't pick it.
A little too simple and too broad.
Especially the first questions should not be frightening but at least tickle your brain "a little bit" instead of just repeating a word from the video.
Thank you very much for your consideration.
some quick and interesting input; kind of basic and superficial, though.
I enjoyed it.
That is much more crucial than some of the fluffy contents.
I worked really hard on this course, but was stymied by a couple of quizzes.
Good, concise course.
The reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because I found it difficult (not impossible) to follow some of professor Eyal Naveh speach.
The mods are doing an amazing job keeping people calm, but Coursera needs to do better.
leading to much sources which is really good enough to seek for more info in law.
It was really basic (but 4 weeks - it`s really short period of time for such topic).
Good , but not very detailed for programming the Arduino
Especially with the course assignment I had a bit trouble to understand, what was wanted.
Introduction to Jacobians and how we can calculate end effector forces with respect to joint torques would really help interlace this class with some of the other classes in this Robotics specialization.
Videos took to long.
We need to practice more, I like theory and I know how important, but I dont think that I learn much from the lessons or quizzes how to code something like the last part.
The scope of the course is really limited, and that is fine for super-introductory courses like this one, but all the emotional attachments aside, looking only into one city's tribunals is questionable from the methodological point of view.
Very scripted and skips way too fast through some of the equations and R code he's trying to teach.
its a 7 week course but it covers very basics which can be easily completed in one week instead of 7 weeks +1 star for funny prof. ;)
The subject is interesting and there's some potential to the practical part of the course.
I only did the first 3 weeks
The deepest depths of the ocean have life forms, yet we'd perish.
Felt that it could have more writing exercises.
Zombis and four-armed (impossible) octpus were obstacles.
I would appreciate more practical cases with the detailed methodology that were applied.
instructor is knowledgeable.
Good project but instruction is a bit draft.
When you find yourself trying to decide between the best answer based on what you have learned and a conceptually worse answer that happens to meet the wording of the question - and trying to guess whether the test-setter is looking to prove your understanding or catch you in a mistake - then you start to suspect that the course has been designed more as a way to earn grades than to actually learn.
Overall it is OK, but the example framework is more like created for teach purpose which is not practical in industry.
Facilitators are expert biostatisticians, not R programmers, and sometimes their explanations of R functionality is superficial and imprecise.
That being said directions sometime can be a little bit confusing.
Each movie/power point starts with the same advertisement and music and it is taking time and attention.
This was an excel course and no excels available.....
However in my view the course needs more practical illustrations of how some of the different strategy definition and approaches are practised (or not) today by modern-day companies.
In lesson 2.7 (I think) where an in-lesson quiz was offered that asked me to choose between A, B, C, or D the visual disappeared so that I was hindered when presented with the questions to answer.
It will help you think about your work habits, as well as introduce you to an array of tools to analyze and make changes in whatever areas in your work or personal life you believe should be more productive/fulfilling.
However, the peer reviewed assignment needs revising.
I submitted all the assignments early for the course, making sure to get in my peer reviewed assignment a week early to ensure that if I needed to, I could resubmit and have time for grading.
As the professor says, both the book and the online resource Dognition isn't needed for the completion of this course.
I look forward to taking to others in the series.
But because of that, it doesn't give a good understandings of each problem.
Nice introduction, but I will start another class on the subject which I would have liked to avoid.
Other than that, no complaints, a single peer assessed project to put into practice what you have learned in the other modules of the specialisation.
My concern is that the Coursera course does not go a lot beyond, basically just referring to the document and adding quizzes + graded assignment in the last week.
Pretty good I think
It would be better if somebody explains in video.
There were only 20-30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignments required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture videos quite a bit.
More examples in video lectures would have helped.
Also the swirl() text was almost verbatim of the lectures one has just watched.
All in all, good information, but the swirl() badly needs an update.
Don't use 'what is the best answer' ("most correct") type questions, they are ALL too subjective to be fair.
Al Filreis is an excellent instructor and very charismatic, unfortunately the poetry taught consists of only one worldview: secular humanist.
Pretty good course for beginners.
I found myself typing codes mindlessly a lot and feeling the guilt that I'm not learning a lot from the app I'm making because there is too much coding going on and it's not clear what's more important.
Many things looks like teaching 5-years old children by serious professors.
But the material is given as natural as possible and milestones are clear and understandable.
Great content- videos and assignments were fantastic.
Little partecipation and interaction with staff and other partecipants makes the course lose a lot of its attractiveness- most of the concepts are not rocket science and one would really benefit from confrontation with other students.
The last 2 lessons did not have much content.
The down side I've found is that Peer review assignment, some of the peers don't review my assignments nicely, I tried to make interaction but seems not working.
Also, only specific solutions are selected.
I wanted to love this course so bad but unfortunately I couldn't.
Although Im not sure how useful meteor is in the real world.
Covers the basic of Linear Regression, would like to see more advanced material.
It is perfect for beginners, but if you're an experienced writer you might be looking for something a little more challenging.
The content is great, but the course lacks support from the staff.
However, the lack of support when I got stuck made it a frustrating experience.
It was a good overview.
The subject matter is great.
)There are also short 5-10 minute interviews with Khenpo Tsultrim Lodro (a short "snapshot" of the Tibetan take on the week's particular subject, which was often better (to me) than the 90min-long "talking head" version ) and Ven.
In an introductory course I would have liked to see a bit more what different data looks like.
There are several mathematical abstractions used that perhaps have a purpose in later machine learning applications but seem unnecessary here.
Another issue is that the course assumes the use of Octave which is not available for Windows users apparently.
This is of course my personal opinion, with all due respect for the Tutors.
(it might possibly be the poor audio that is off putting as well)
Because the multiple-response answers are immediately visible, a student could boost into the generous passing range on a second attempt just by seeing which boxes should have been checked or left unchecked.
Assessment of knowledge (quizzes) are weak.
Very common curse about common data things.
Really interesting course and material and a very good instructor.
This Course is very interesting because it covers the work from iconic photographers since its invention in 1839 to these days.
How to leave safe mode if the Name node is in safe mode.
I do feel I learned a lot from it...
and i plan to finish the specialization, but this one should be aided as part of another another module.
At times comments did not match the scores, such as "nice work," or "good job," while giving only 3 stars.
The course is too short.
.
However, I would have expected better from a Stanford faculty member.
The class was OK.
Very frustrating to get this far only to be stopped because you're on your very own.
Nonetheless it was a satisfying experience though it took me a lot of time and effort to complete the assignments.
Very good for course for beginners in javascript.
More detailed insight of topics is required is what I felt.
Not for beginners in the slightest.
I did not receive a grade on my assignment until after the deadline was passed.
Whilst the material in the course is fine (although repetitious in places), the pacing is fairly poor.
Ultimately, there are three things covered by this course: a brief overview of remote sensing, hands-on raster classification and hands-on work with Model Builder work (using hydrology as an example framework).
Content of lectures is poor.
First course of this specialization was really GREAT, byt this course disappoints.
Of course, there are some interesting topics, but the form of the course is way lazier.
My amount has been deducted from the bank, but no intimation from this is obtained, neither from Coursera nor Paytm.
Particularly there was no practical assessment on traveling salesman
Then he does not explain much more complex issues throughout the course.
3.
Somewhat odd levels of difficulty.
Thanks a lot to authors!
Lots of talking head videos without enough visual aids to solidify the adult learning process.
I hardly used any of the suggested readings or references as I found them too technical.
Except for the very end there are no quizzes and assignments.
Having said all that, the concepts and algorithms taught are very interesting and a good first step into the unsupervised learning section.
The downside the course feels pretty shallow and then the next course in the specialization -- regression -- feels like a pretty stark contrast.
i am very excited that i become a programmer and ihope that in the end of this course i become like a professional programer.
Course is generall very good and lots of fun!2 things i would change:... the Assignment 1 is too early in the course or the Lectures are disordered, but I needed the second and third week material to do the first weeks assignment.... Add Jupyter Notebooks in the Specialization in addition to Knit-R
And one typo caused me to fail some assignments.
The professors were great, but the content was esoteric and incredibly focused on research based "data science" and less on business analytics or more practical applications of data science for the working professional.
Keep them open!
Easy MOOC for starters
This great course and greate insturactor
The content of the class is very nice.
Could've done with a bit less history and more up to date information.
Overall enjoyed this class.
It is a very short and informative course, but it focused more on professional life than personal life.
The course is OK, but in my opinion the price 69€ is higher for the material you learn.
Lower price probably more people take the course payingAlso is a pitty that people we do not want to pay, we could not have a final assignement.
I believe that in courses like this the contents are to sparse.
It would serve as an introduction.
At minimum, a list of relevant equations would have helped.
The acoustics part of the content seemed somewhat sketchy and hand-wavy; the assumptions and limitations behind the rule-of-thumb equations and models presented weren't given much weight, so I wasn't able to get a good grasp of when they were relevant*.
They — we, as I am member of the team — are highly concerned about educational materials and motivated to enhance the quality of the materials, even for free of charge.
Anyway I am glad I finished this course, as it gave me understanding which way should I continue with diving deeper into the theme.
Thank you!
It is assumed you understand binary numbers.
Particularly with regard to classifiedColumns.
But there is actually experience required on financial statements and concepts.
It's all or nothing so if you submit *anything*, you get a grade (and it usually approaches 100%) but I didn't really get much helpful/thoughtful feedback on anything I did since you literally get ZERO feedback from the instructors (nothing!)
Who can read Korean should really learn this course?
The most happening and lively subject like this needs a delivery in a exalted method.
Overall Great Job by Professor Brooks.
I like it Ok because it gives you a deep level of understanding behind the numerical underpinnings of basic machine learning algorithms.
It was theoretical but provided an apt understanding.
I am a Francophone and I still find it not easy to understand the English (having French translation in my mind.
I remember in one class, "data dredging" is discussed for about 2-3 minutes.
I like the instructor's approach.
Great course!Very well organized, and worked in a format where you would build as you learned and had several milestones for review.
The one complaint I have is that the final asks for you to work in Tableau, and provides you a license for 15 days, although the course runs longer than that.
It was an interesting course, and some of the advices that have been given are quite useful.
What lost points for the course was not the content provided by Wesleyan, which was good, but the poor effort on the part of many of the fellow students to really work on constructive critiques.
For all your quiz and assignment time-to-completion estimates, multiply them by 4 or more.
Super interesting, but it is a very basic introduction to nutrition.
I do not find this course is useful to learn seems it only gives a guideline to the python database.
Subject matter was well presented except too many stops to push his book.
It would be perfect for kids getting ready to head off to college who've never cooked for themselves.
The course is fun and a very intresting approach to game design throug board game design.
Watch (or download) any video or transcript to your heart's content whenever you wish in any order you wish.
Not because my model was wrong (I was able to implement it and to check it against some hand-written and proved examples - which I should probably thank again), but because I was not able to make it run efficiently enough for the given constraints.
Being stuck in this stage for longer than I wanted, I had to sacrifice another important steps of data analysis pipeline in order to not jeopardize my final delivery by not meeting the final due date.
You don't really learn all that much, but then again I have experience with R and some data stuff already, so perhaps it'd be more useful for someone else.
And from the other hand, if some introduction is again repeated in the subsequent modules, then why have this introductory course anyways?Thanks.
Otherwise, the other lectures were very good, concise, and clear.
The sound volume of the videos is not consistent, hope Coursera can improve a bit on this.
Pretty good intro into accessing web data.
Loved the project, but I am going to keep my review at 3 stars until there is a module to add capstone project to a web page.
Also, Mohamed Noor is very enthusiastic, and provides a lot of nice examples to illustrate the course.
It is as if our brain need first to establish a category-pattern (the concept/context) to which it will associate detail-patterns.
I'm torn about this course.
On the other hand, the last two weeks are boring and dull: they take the typical psychiatric bias and simply ignore any research compromising their orthodoxy (for example, Kirsch's studies).
I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignments just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture.
So overall, the course was challenging and definitely a fair amount of work coming from someone new to python (but moderately experienced in C programming), and although I would have liked a bit more guidance, I learned a lot.
Lecture is in boring format/tone (to slow), quizzes are boring (single or multiply choice questions - can be solve by tries and errors, open questions are ambiguous).
I like content of this course (I learned few new things), but you have to work on form...
It's sometimes difficult to follow professors beacuse they take for granted information about the examples they use that is not evident for the learners.
It would have helped if the problem sets were more challenging and in tune with real world applications.
It would be professional of the instructor to cite sources and employ classic principles of curriculum design.
Easy to get in, now I know the basics of Python.. however, maybe too much extra stuff and discussion about this and that.
If he did that in a RT University he would be hauled over the coals.
Very useful
A great course.
Poor delivery, very hard to listen.
One for beginners and one for people who are more comfortable with coding and R. I think that the learning curve is too steep for a part time course.
Not bad, but doesn't really add much value to the courses before.
Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them.
I feel the course should have been titled The History of the Beatles.
Some points were technical making a key understanding of how to present a resume
SInce the idea was for participants to develop a project with ongoing editing based on peer feedback, this process is key.
brought up some good concept inside, like "tidy data", but not in detail, how to grab data from different source shouldn't be difficult.
It's a very short simple introduction.
Could incorporate examples outside the health world as well.
Though there was a lot to cover in the four weeks but this was not best way to do it.
Basic introduction to data science.
At times, even a one-line answer needs to be in a separate document.
I found Cheri Alexander's sections to be extremely long-winded, unclear, and redundant.
A lot of interesting parts of the course are available as optional and a lot of the difficult parts of the coding exercises are provided to you - the challenge is not there.
It's a good course where I come across bower and CSS how to use the function for the UI frameworks.
There isn't really enough material to justify it, but it does cover the basics for someone with little to no development experience.
Some interesting lessons, yet a rather boring presentation as most faculty were reading their scripts, or seemed nearly jet-lagged in some lessons.
The second week, by Wietse Tol, is simply brilliant.
where they use material outside of the course readings which may sound plagiarizing after that long warning in each introductory section for writing assignements.
Good information.
Although it's easy to use, I would have preferred programming using a more widely used and more powerful environment.2) The auto grader for the class was not very robust and did a poor job of giving feedback on why things weren't passing.
I understood the concepts presented in the videos (and got a high grade in the end), but the JavaScript needed for the last assignment was way over my head.
Just too short, and should provide more content.
I was less keen on the parts on modes and pentatonics but on the other hand for someone further along in their musical journey it may be just the thing.
Instead of reading blogs and books on graphic design and then following that up with consequent practice I decided to take up this course which would help me do both more efficiently and so far I'm not regretting my decision.
It's a great course!
Coursera is a great place to learn different subjects without borders.
Even though this is more a practical course, it will benefit from being a bit more rigorous ; so at least people can make proofs on they own.
Other than that, it is a great course.
This is obviously an issue for Coursera to address as it relates to the platform design rather than the course team but it is nevertheless frustrating.
There is a big disconnect between the standards the instructors seem to expect and the assignments submitted.
I think there was some issues while migrating to updated coursera version, that is why some course materials lost.
Please do better job of QA before posting these documents.
Overall it is a good course, however, despite assuming minimal knowledge of Excel Statistical Modules, it offers little insight and practice.
The history of the universe, mainkind and the future in 6 weeks.
sir, could you pl.
Not very helpful for later concepts and would not recommend for business professionals that have experience
Some readings, for example, would be welcome to give example of great (or even not so great) characterization.
It is a course with lots of information but the delivery is a little weak.
I do wish, however, that the statistics intro was more applied and covered a better intro and application to the why!
The course failed to mention dairy products.
Really nice but a little complex for people who just want to learn the basics.
Interesting subject, but I think it can delivered in more interactive ways.
The topic is overall well covered.
The material are not easy to go through and do not reference well key knowledge area, specifically: how to apply them.
The exercises and the assignments could be largely improved: the targets and the guidance are not always clear.
Informative but not ideal for anyone not going into business.
The lectures are quite abstract and the exam is a practical application of the concept.
The instructions of the course also aren't very good as you need to do each part of the final project at the end of each week.
I would strongly suggest to not take this course unless you have many spare hours.
When doing this specialisation there should be credit for those that did the other data science specialisation
And because didn't made a proper link between Accounting and Analytics.
The lectures could have been structured differently, so as to facilitate engagement - I found myself easily losing focus and having to repeat the videos.
At times the content can be confusing.
The content is very basic.
The course is challenging and the exams use real-world data.
The sequence of the course is not linear, the exams are too difficult compared to the material covered in classes.
If you have some basic programming skills and want to solve interesting problems, you should give this course a try.
Most of it was common sense.
The parameters for grading were extremely simple and the feed back was quite subjective from students that did not understand the assignments.
While I learned some useful information, I won't continue with this course.
I would give it a 3.5, with the extra 0.5 because of the great interaction, ease of use, and clarity of progress.
I took this course because of artworks, so I was not interested in papers.
Videos were great; especially the first one in each lesson.
We're building the data...
We spent too much time on rivers/watersheds.
Pros: mostly clear, Cons: it may require outside supplements to fully understand and complete the assignments.
I enjoyed the earlier courses more.
Good intro to the terms, concepts, and approach for data science.
Doug's lectures were great!
I think the video issues that I've mentioned should been carefully planned before this course made it mainstream.
This is my opinion.
Very simple course instruction and materials with difficult programming assignments.
Use this course to reinforce your front end skills and not to learn for the first time.
Please :)
I was expecting more from Yonsei University
Although an excellent course, it seemed a bit too easy - not challenging enough.
No one seems to monitor the forums on an ongoing basis.
I kept on wanting to tell him to sit up and breath and speak naturally!
Overall, since it was 101 and basic, I enjoyed learning the new information.
Course was pretty boring, repetition of Digital Marketing previous modules, would appreciate it more if the professor did a better presentation!
Impossible...
So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book.
On my trial-run attempt, before the videos, I score close to or above the passing level.
I liked the valuation module the most!
Meh.
I appreciated the new perspectives on learning, and the smaller chunks of video and assignments (which allowed me to spread the work out over the week).
The "Thanks for Learning about Learning" phrase was fine for the course introduction and the final module, but became annoying as the closing phrase.
In one case people asked about it, and it turned out that the grading criteria were wrong, but they were never updated.
-Made on 10/05/2016- Low quantity of information and resources.
The course was informative and engaging.
I attend almost all other courses in this specialization (except of "data product") and this one is, on my opinion, the weakest one.
Nice course, yet more hands on work was expected.
A bit too much talking in front of a wall ;-) Could benefit from more illustrative material.
There were a few places where there were mistakes in the instructions or the code downloaded from github had some errors.
Could be more computer friendly.
I thinks it only happens to me.
The javascript was very difficult, I could not complete.
I wish we had more examples and practical exercises.
This course is a very basic introduction to Python.
The overall outline are great.
Overall good course that would definitely make you spend more time reading and learning on the side.
It's not the fault of the professor but this course and the Big Data specialization attempts to cover too much information.
Although it delves into key elements of trading where it really matters, course lacks explanation on some subjects.
Consider adding a programming assignment to the course curriculum.
Course contents are not very well organized.
I never saw actual teachers teaching something in this course, just browsing, reading and eassy writing.
Pretty simple, the Univ of Michigan Data Science with Python set the bar pretty high.
Sometimes the comment in the code are wrong or misleading.
It managed to whet my appetite for more , however I'm not sure the course is very useful on its own.
It was pretty good, but most of the information is rehashed briefly in the intro to R Programming
The only problem is feed back or lack thereof.
I am sure the course moderators are very busy and do not have time to be browsing around the question forums every day, but so am I.
My least favorite course in the specialization.
In general, it's very good!1) The interview and other stuff in the bonus video should renamed as optional or other names.
Felt too lecture-based and observational.
However, I plan on doing this on my own through the GIS help boxes before I take the 4th class.
The first two weeks were good.
The concepts are very good but very theoretical.
More quantitative analysis should be added to prepare students to deal with the real world problems.
I would like a different approach on the way this course is given to the student.
This gives the last week to produce products for submission or continue the work from the third week.
Hopefully in upcoming repeat sessions of the course, pacing will be improved, the grading rubric provided before final submission for the sake of transparency and clarity, and a little more guidance and actual feedback available in the forums, which are largely deserted at this point.
I really enjoyed the content and learned a lot but, there were far too many videos that were not functional.
If you are expecting any kind of Android related learning.
Lectures were fairly straightforward but not really that exciting and the lecturers sometimes felt a little unprepared or underwhelming.
I wish it could be harder and have more challenging quizzes than simply arithmetic and multiple choice.
I like the content of the course.
However, there are some remarks I want to share.
For one of the asssignments I have to create an accout on Soundcloud.
Very basic material, but a good introduction and a necessary step to ensure a baseline of knowledge for future courses in the data science specialization.
Also because the only forum for interacting with them is entirely public it's impossible to receive any formal code review apart from the automated tests they run when you submit.
Contents are great and very relative.
I was trying to go back and finish week 6 video #4 but was unable to open the course!
When do I need to use independent events as opposed to independent processes?The graded assignments are of varying quality.
Potentially interesting and useful material presented in boring and sometimes unclear manner.
But It was really short and contain too little information and subject.
But for those who have really sedentary way of life is very helpful.
Maybe we will explore more of the functionality in the later courses.
It starts to introduce you to the language and platforms of data science, but it is most definitely not a standalone course if you want to be conversant in the field.
The assignments are not very relevant to what is being taught.
Another thing is some of the instructions are not clear for instance the guidance to how to submit an assignment.
So, it is very simple.
But, I think that these lectures lacks logiccal explanation.
Pros:(1) Teachers know what they are talking.
I would prefer a more hard core course with detailed explanation of the working mechanism of solar cells.
The lectures were the redeeming factor.
Someone needs to review/proofread the final part and assignment.
Also, they could've given us the option of choosing a programming language.
Did not meet my expectations.
Then I have to search back on other website,say like www.
Some parts looked useful, but when I tried it in practice, it was almost impossible to do for me.
I didn't like the interaction sessions with the other two instructors, i want to learn about writing not hear about other stuff or listen to some folks at a cafe.
The interface of the classes is too straight, not very flexible.
This was a decent class to get started on programming a Raspberry Pi and hooking it up to a web service.
Another good course in the Python Specialisation!
If you are interested in applied machine learning techniques (for text retrieval and analysis) this is not really the course to take.
Although I understand some may need it, the command line course was pretty basic.
Just realize that ML is basically applied math, and without a good math knowledge it is almost pointless to approach the subject
Good material and final.
It looks like a (notsogood) synthetis of the course available on Yale website
Student should be able to see results of test ( at least quiz 1 and 2) before we decide to purchase.
If you do not know Bootstrap, JQuery, javascript .... you will get lost after two weeks and from the feedback, it can be clear seen.
The course needs to be re-structured.
Although very interesting, the lecture series does not really live up to its title.
Very lite on material
The course material could have been better....
Instructor was just reading out content, more practical example and case studies could be a part of content.
Easy and quick to do food demonstrations, basic enough that students can build upon them depending on what is available at hand.
Some ideas just tend to be redundant throughout the weeks, but I guess that is what she wants to stress on.
The discussion forums were lifeless with virtually no staff participation.
It's all about following very specific (long) instructions - "put this line of JS here", "create a function called Foo", etc.
Grading is done by peers, even though it could be automated.
I found the lectures on Agile principles, etc., very theoretical and textbook-style -- not too interesting.
What I disliked was abundance of personal-computer slang in the language of the professor, jamming all the peer-reviewed assignments into only two weeks and the incident with broken APA style.
Despite my criticisms mentioned, I am grateful to the professor, HSE and Coursera staff, and my classmates for the opportunity and experience!
The course itself is good.
Its good but found it a little theoretical.
is it philosophy?
Just can read through slides to complete it
Good review of the theory but course is outdated given the number of events in the last 2 years that relate to the information provided in the course -- particularly as it relates to attacks
Good overview, but some of the content is just quickly mentioned and not put into practice.
I only audited the course.
interesting course way to feminized.
Upgrade to submit?
The course is ok, the instruction was very poor for the deep learning section of the course.
Really a good course for people who suffers a lot in modern society.
I don't know...
But thank you for putting this up and giving me a head start into innovative ideas for starting a new business.
Some parts of the test require to check the documentation or looking in the internet cause it wasnt explained in the videos.
After trying some Java, Ruby seems pretty easy but from what I've seen, RoR should be a tool for startup enthusiasts who require easy prototyping and low knowledge of programming/web development.
This course is explained as if the students are programmers / web developers that already use tools like github, heroku, unit testing who probably dont require that explanation in first place, but is not deep enough for newcomers.
I recommend take a bit more time and include more steps of learning, maybe 1 first course for Ruby before getting into Ruby on Rails.
you cant do the final thing unless you pay so That minuses 2 stars.
Good for introductory stats students, not great for those interested in furthering their knowledge of R.
Mentiones a list of places where one or another practice is implemented.
Week 3 involves subsetting, sorting, reshaping and merging data.
The slides used to back the video lectures should also been made available.
One case, this is my opinion but it's nice if students learn how scala solves "The dining philosophers" issue.
But to speedy for a newbie in the area, pace could have been slower.
Not many new concepts.
Be prepared to look a lot of things up independently or purchase the "optional" text book.
You will find yourself googling a lot of things as the videos cover certain aspects quite quickly, even some that are important to the assignments.
If you have the time to research some of the concepts on your own I say go for it.
Weekly quizzes would be great!
The production of this course could be much clearer and as such this is a very tedious course.
If the lecture had been in English, it would have been a lot more understandable.
The only issue was the Programming assignment, which could have been more descriptive.
It gives a well based numeric approach to sustainable development, but fails to approach some subjects from an ethical point of view.
I think that the information for the assignments must be more clear, templates for the tasks needs revision.
Pretty boring.
While the game-oriented approach is fun, I don't like the excessive focus upon the simplegui module which was created by the instructors specifically for this course.
This didn't help the learning process.
extremely high level
The staff does not enforce the Rubric Instructions for the Peer Review(at least my experience).
Most reviews do not critique, offer constructive criticism, and in some cases I am confident, the answers were not even read.
As I said, I did learn a bit, but it was a bit of a struggle that required multiple attempts to complete.
Sometimes the supplementary reading contained examples that could have been better explained in a video.
But there's not enough practical advices about how in this course.
A few worked examples might be good
Good effort but spice up the video a bit with salient stuff instead of pure talking and notes would be good.
It is incredibly slow, I really don't understand who might need a whole lecture to get the concept of functions or so.
Incredibly basic- more for the average person rather than a student or professional, but it seems as though that is who the material is directed at- so not a great course if you are a professional looking to increase your knowledge, but great usable information that the average person can easily apply.
Also, it requires me to start the next video and set the speed to x2 again.
Overall, lectures are OK and material is explained well.
Programming assignments are worthless, as they are basically "Fill one line of code that does X.
Be transparent with future prospective students that this course absolutely requires knowledge of calculus, probability, and statistics.
Be warned - practice problems come from a textbook not available online or open-source.
I was failed because my explanatory note - not the piece itself, just a note for context - took me 34 words over.
Quizzes are horrible.
Better feedback on errors regarding quizzes' questions and still really interesting assignments for peer review that help you to learn.
A standard practice for students in online courses, if a quiz can be taken more than once, is to take the quiz before studying the material.
I wish it was more comprehensive though.
videos can be more interactive with more information on the slides.
The course can use more visuals instead of videos of the face of the instructor.
I must have misunderstood or have another file, because no one I read had such question and I got not so great reviews.
An entry level informative course suitable for everyone who wants to have basic understanding in the areas.
a bit boring lectures
If only the audio was clearer.
Background with Database Management and Python really helps.
it is NOT for beginner, the student should have "more than average" in the programming languages, in order to get benefit from this course.
There was some amount of confusion in the Quizzes and we didnt get moderation.
The contents are OK, but the unity packages for the course are unaccessible(download speed is about 8kb/s and stops at 30MB, never able to download).
The course assignments weren't challenging enough for me and lectures were too slow for my liking.
Also, the "angel x devil" debates are equally silly, opposite to the following overview video which is excellent.
I should have expected this as the course came from the University of Melbourne, but I have the feeling that some courses on Coursera feel a bit more "global"...
This may be because instead of just using a typical ide like eclipse or netbeans, they use bluejay, which works different than the rest of ides.
I understand that it’s really just a quick intro into upcoming specialization courses.
I also found myself questioning the veracity of many conclusions, as the lecture often had difficulty citing more than a couple specific points of evidence for his arguments.
It lacks programming assignments and a base for understanding the algorithms exposed.
This is a very poor way to manage course content - forcing students to rely solely on the videos.
I'm left feeling I've only learned a smattering here and there of Scala, and don't think I'll take the remainder of the specialization as I had intended.
Lecture video pause points are bugged.
Despite I guess the course has a pretty good coverage of the ML basics, it is definitely just an introductive class.
The information was useful.
If you have never done any managerial training or read material on intrinsic motivation, org and team culture, then you will get value.
Furthermore, with all the new concepts, visual aid would help students understand what things are and what they look like since the backgrounds chosen for the lectures have little or nothing to do with the course whatsoever.
On the other hand, I do think that the questions throughout the videos are extremely useful as they (usually) tackle problems that were not mentioned previously and gets the student to think independently.
It's more or less a repetition of what you've learned in all the courses, tying four peer-reviewed assignments together into a somewhat contrived "project".
One portfolio piece at the end of an 8-month course does not seem adequate to me.
(Not the case!
Nice course, but very practical at the expense of theory.
Professor Harris does a good job overall, but he does not explain Python syntax in depth.
I understand I joined the free audit and I`m really thankful to have access to all the material.
For example, I wrote an essay and received a non-passing grade.
You don't need to understand to complete assigements, but netherless - it's hard to understand if you do not have experience in embedded systems topic
Not so good.
You do need to know some basics before attempting the course.
Aren`t there any small diary farm en USA ?
However, pictures and graphics mean a thousand words.
I suggest less gimmicks and more focus on learning the history.
This course was very average to me.
In addition, the exams some times become a bit too subjective of what the classmates want to grade you.
There is no logical process taught about how to move forward if you get stuck.
It is informative, but there are many basics that were not covered well & there was a lot of information that was not that interesting (like too much history)
While the course is basic, the tests don't test user concepts (for example the order of the 4 step design process is asked 10+ times through the 5 modules)
Perhaps a formal process (same as previous course where a SHA commit is submitted and source is automatically downloaded (and plagiarism detected) & run to verify the output that columns / data meet an acceptable criteria
I really enjoyed the assignments but felt there should have been more assessment/practice provided -there are no quizzes to reinforce understanding.
if you're a somewhat experienced programmer looking to start and hand on learn how to build apps this course is not for you.
The final project was considerably harder than the material taught in the class and problems with the course (e.
g.
While this course is well organized and descriptive, it barely touches the Internet of Things technologies.
Interesting and thought provoking course BUT the peer assignment tasks and evaluation criteria are moving targets that seem to be very hard to hit per my own experience and the discussion forums.
Some of the videos are labelled wrong and have the wrong subtitles to go along with it.
Unfortunately I can not deal with the professors voice.
The content is good.
Be prepared to fight bugs on your own.
It is wonderful for a beginner who knows nothing about programming.
This is basic content i wish it was a more outside just a lecture style where the lecturer just reads from the slides.
I did learn a decent amount, can't deny that at all, but don't expect even the tiniest effort from anyone to help you with anything under any circumstance.
This was a very basic class.
Good course
I found the persistent reading of the slides to be a little tedious.
This is an area that is changing rapidly, monthly, and this course can't really be seen to be current any more.
I really enjoyed all the pieces I encountered and felt like I had a somewhat better understanding of modern art after taking this course.
Too fast and too short.
The first week assignment should really be the second week assignment since all the lessons about knitr would have made the assignment much easier.
Very interesting course for those who want to fully understand the inner workings of a computer.
However, the utilities offered are a bit neglected.
It's a good course with some interesting resources.
I wish, the professor could pay more attention to from questions from students.
Expected: add quizzes as it was in the first course.
I have no complaints over the content.
These days, there are kids putting out more gracefully performed and highly polish productions than this on Youtube.
Let me congratulation the developers for all their hard work.
I recommend it only for beginners who know nothing of Chinese.
In comparison to the first course this one lacks a lot of organization and debugging before sending it to the public
Too much focusing on history of telephony and only little focus on IoT.
Very uneven.
For a week I kept searching for the "problem" and the mobile app said all complete, the desktop assignment tab finally revealed my issue.
John from week 5 uses examples from the Beatles, which is great, but he's the only one.
Would be nice to have the option to skip it for more advanced students.
Also the recorded lectures are really quite, so you have to turn up the speaker a lot.
Highly recommended .
Wonderful course and good content but a bit slow ..
Could have been faster.
Geared specifically to college professors, as opposed to general public.
I was quite bored and had to go through all the videos just to complete the assignment which cannot be completed if you don't go through all the videos which I think is the drawback for this course.
Slides with examples were useful, slides with clip-art and comic stips less so.
Too much HR and not as engaging as the other courses in the specialization
Personally, I have to occasionally refer to other basic statistics materials to be able to follow the flow and understand the lectures.
For the course project, there is a huge discrepancy in what the project expect the students to perform and the peer grading criteria.
I realized that those who examined me in the first and second time, had little or no idea about financial analysis.
Very mixed feelings about this course.
Generally speaking, the course lectures are informative and well organized.
This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before.
I wish there had been more practice with actually using JavaScript; as it is I think I'll need to take another course or do independent study to learn what I should have learned to complete the last assignment.
In general, I enjoyed the contents of the course.
Thank you.
With all my respect to authors, I skipped Parham again and found a few errors, for example statements like "if bool == true" and layout related errors in the "starter" app at the end of the course.
Worse than Scala Principles - too chaotic.
Better grading system would be good.
Hopefully the course admin can rectify this aspect of the course.
The electronics part was more reasonable, but still suffered from some over-simplification (for example, the model of guitar pickups didn't include magnetic hysteresis).
All in all, the course was worth taking, but I think the material deserves more rigor.
It's not a big problem but new versions bring new functionality and give more power to the developer.
This could be provided before or after the course, but the way I really learn is by reading other peoples code and seeing ways to code problems.
I would prefer it if the course leaders would take the time to look at the content of this and other iMBA courses and ensure that the content takes on a more neutral tone, to make it feel more welcoming to people traditionally shut out of very senior roles
very simple .
But it needs some polishing...
Major comment:The assignment submission/review process should be improved.
There isn't enough depth and a lot of it involves common sense.
I am sure, but in a way for me it is difficult to follow.
The best course so far (though that's not saying much).
The main reason for my rating is because the course is so "loose" on what your are supposed to achieve incrementally every week that it can lead to some hard situations.
Just to give my example: the first week was piece of cake and I didn't feel like it really contribute for the following weeks.
You can audit it for free, if you do not want a cert.
This course requires solid grounding in mathematics.
Good, but overemphasizes niche software product (graphlab).
It's a decent course.
Also is very static, uses very little illustrations / animations / visuals, which is a shame for a photography course...
But I'm not into it because I like developing games more than thinking about design.
Although the course material is very good but what I believe is that Image processing is a course where only theory isn't sufficient.
Yet, the course requires solid amount of polishing.
Concepts are explained in a rather structured way and hands-on with Neo4j are interesting.
The last part with GraphX is pure copy-paste of orders, it is disappointing and not a good way to practive.
The course needs a reboot.
A good foundation course.
But good stuff to know.
This is good content, but way too broad and general to be considered a proper introduction.
I would like something with more practice and less theory.
Congrats !
There were a lot of good nuggets in here, but overall this course felt somewhat disjointed compared to the others.
Basic Course.
Its a good course for starters.
I like this lesson.
No tricks.
Not the course id think it would be.
I learn less information than i d expect but these were still usefull information.
Often it's not clear the requirement of the task.
This course gives you a general overview over nutrition.
The most value of this course is the documentation to write down game ideas in.
This should all make sense by the fact that the course alone is 4 weeks long.
The criteria are: "Is each plot/R outout followed by a narrative", "Does the narrative correctly interpret the plots, or statistics", "Does the narrative address the research question".
The current quizzes are very trivial and doesn't test the understanding of the material only the fact that you actually went through the lectures even if quickly.
This course is addressing a critical subject matter.
This course leaves students with only basic knowledge of the subject matter, which is fine considering the course timeline.
Material somewhat simplistic and professor likes to "hold your hand" rather than exposing the material and letting the student run with it.
People had a tendency, particularly on the first assignment, to read in requirements that were not actually stated or written down and failed people accordingly.
but there isn't.
He does introduce the terms in 3.01 but just after one video the words don't magically sit in my memory.
I've given 3 stars because although I have to work double hard just to make sense of what the instructor says by reading a book on basic statistics, at least the videos provide a structure, good examples and after watching them a few times things become clear.
excavation, prepping, waterproofing, etc.)
Now you have to go back and re-do your homework assignment after you learned what was really expected from the student.
But that is silly, given that only now we humans are just coming a tiny bit close to understanding how our brain works and how all the intricacies of the universe function - when He had that all figured out and established from the beginning.
As for me, i would prefer having more advanced tests and tasks as the given ones did not really help me remember the materials.
Hello, as previous ones, this cousrse gives you basic understanding of the field and provide you with some additional materials for learning.
While there were many typos in screenshots and code examples, this course has been a tremendous help to me as I reinforced some things I already knew about JavaScript and learned new concepts about the JavaScript language (like coding in events or working with the DOM).
What I didn't care for was so much time being spent on the IBM BlueMix and other software tutorials.
Content is very basic.
To tackle such key concepts and tools of statistics, you need the appropriate time.
Also I will love external resources to study and examples of design thinking applied in different types of industries
This course has a great potential, but the subject of each week was very superficial.
(3) The teachers, although they know what they are talking about, they aren't very good at teaching.
Feels like everything is solved using a caret package, while the back-end theory is only slightly touched.
The courses are more expensive (This one was $100).
I found some videos on the internet help more than this course.
Need to take a hiatus; this would be the perfect class to prep for my TexEs teacher certification test in two years.
Very few programming assignments..
The course is OK, but I'd rather learned app development with Python or Java.
a figure with 3 formulas and many variables there was no way to know in what alpha variable in formulas the instructor was talking about, once all formulas had the alpha variable.
But in general, the course is lack of content in depth.
The first 3 weeks are really good, 5 stars.
This is a good course, I would just do some things a little differently, for example, I don't agree with weighing oneself daily.
A small detail but it should be corrected.
I really enjoy discovering the world of the teacher and friends.
Course material is not enough, you need to also refer at least one reference book as well.
In general I liked the course and content!
Though the course itself is introductory in nature, i wish there was a lecture on what and how exactly are these going to be useful with the help of a real life example and also an increase in the depth of the content.
Tests are poorly worded sometimes in ways that contradict the language used in the lectures, making them difficult to pass even with notes.
THe format for the lecture videos varies throughout and this inconsistency (along with extreme audio volume changes) also becomes distracting.
Other than that, excellent for driving the need for reproducible research (RR) home, presenting and explaining some tools available to achieve RR and ways of publishing results/reports from these studies.
very useful and well designed
I, on the other side, have already had some exposure to software development and algorithms, but when Pavel mentions gene expression and transcription I have a very vague idea what he is talking about.
Felt that the first week, how to get a job in SEO should be the last module.
But again, its for beginners.
For me also not enough accent was on html 5 features with dedicated examples how use new tags and attributes.
Much theorical with few examples.
Overall happy to have learnt from this, but clarity of assignments should be improved.
Cramming all the material relating to NoSQL and Graph Analytics into the final week without assignment is ineffective.
Great work!
A clear structure for learning lacks, and some of the lectures seem to be more about the people talking about their own work than trying to convey general concepts in the drug discovery field.
This is a course for the art crowd, not for those interested in the history of photography.
It could be part of a greater course.
Not really a fan of Mick's way of teaching, he seems to have spent most of his time playing with the music or drawing app rather than explaining the features.
I felt like the questions asked in the quiz were considerable above and beyond what was taught - and the amount of R itself taught felt like being thrown in the deep end.
Interesting course but would have liked some additional video discussions from practitioners in the field.
Some other courses lack explanations.
But!But, I don't think it's worth to pay 61 dollar for a couple of hours of lectures, that you can finish during 1 day.
I'm really disappointed with the fact, that it's not possible to go through quizes and assignments without payment.
The videos were a bit too lengthy, however.
I mean one of its articles could 3 times shorter if he gets straight to the point
It was supposed to be 3 hours but, got obsessed to have them ended ok, but in 15 hours nearly.
Not enough Tableau use for it to be in the title of the course
The intros into various aspects of the curriculum also serve to prepare you mentally for the coming weeks.
Good introduction to very basic stuff.
The course did give me the the theoretical and syntactical basics in terms of how web programming is done using python.
Plus, it has to be noted that I am writing this as a Mathematics graduate, and this course was most probably not meant for people with any background.
The course was really great and understandable, in my point of view it would have been a bit more challenging, but still a great course, especially thank to Colleen and her great approach!!
I guess may be good if you've never done introspective exercises before.
There wasn't much discussion back and forth among the students.
I had to use YouTube a couple times to get a better understanding of the material.
Whatever they teach in theory has to be implemented as part of programming assignments which makes learning experience wonderful.
I hope that you will give due importance to programming assignments from next session.
I think it would help students to more easily remember the function of code if only the right code is shown in examples.
Just three stars so far, I've just started the course late...
"There were also no Mentors or TAs to guide students or answer questions.
I liked the topics.
Really proud of myself for getting through it.
The video lectures are not engaging at all.
Sometimes I don't understand when the lecture gives some examples of an abstract concept
I guess it would be hard to grade essay questions in a class this big, but the content could go a little faster.
Maybe this is because classification concepts are more intuitive.
Had it not been for discussions on the student forum I would not have been able to complete the final assignment.
Despite the shortcomings I would recommend this for someone who is good in Java and would like to get a technical as well as comprehensive understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.
So, these are the issues:
I previously gave this course a 5-star review; however, upon realising that there is no way to access the classroom after receiving the final grade and certificate, I simply can't give it the same excellent review.
).
The fourth week exam doesn't offers the pdf of the results.
I mean, it has to be "in Practice".
It seems there is too much information and too much talk for things that are easily understood and do not need all this going over and over again.
This course would work better if the material wasn
Great for beginners and reminders!I was hoping for something more advanced & was a bit disappointed.
Again!
I wrote some, but never got any answer.
Get ready for a course that assumes you have all the software they use already installed without advanced notice or instructions!
The Sharon Salzberg (SS), in her interview, brought up an excellent point.
I probably could have got as much out of it as following the tutorials on GitHub and the new desktop tool.
For non programmers it is not evident to find a solution to some of the assignments and there isn't much guidance on how to use certain tools.
why start with iferror and not find/left/right, etc).
The video content is largely just reading the text of the slides.
I enjoyed the course but quite frankly, it was very basic.
Would have rated it 4 if i had received my certificate of accomplishment like i was told at the starting of the course.
The test questions ask you to recite information from the video lectures and reading, rather than thinking critically.
Well, I think I learnt some things about JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
This is a reasonably thorough introduction to the principals of functional programming in scala, but to fully grasp the material presented I found it necessary to include supplemental material such as the functional programming in scala book by Paul Chiusano (forward by the course instructor funnily enough).
I think Punctuacion is the main topic
Why should I do extra reading that brings me no extra knowledge?On a good side, one can pass quiz without any reading.
Good content, feels very automated
Only 37 minutes of video, average per week.
Concepts are interesting, the assignments are not.
But the lecturer and course itself was really nice.
Mostly a series of tips on how to take advantage of human susceptibility to persuasion.
Passing the class by rote following of the examples will not give you the proper proficiency.
and the expectation to review the quiz questions thought up by other students.
Grammar and syntax in the west is very different depending on the country you come from - German syntax vs Italian vs English.
Weeks 3 through 6 were super technical.
Otherwise, its a great course with emphasis on different aspects of business writing.
This industry is fast moving so its a bit dated with its content -- for example, this was done before Ethereum so it is not mentioned at all.
The content was useful and I do feel a foundation is being set.
The area where I think the course fell short is on the support we got from mentors or instructors in the forum, basically null - pun intended.
Good material, but wish it had more assignments to hold you accountable.
The lectures are well worth it though.
Very basic course, not too challenging to a non-american.
Prof. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak demonstrates great knowledge about the subjects, covering literature, government, and philosophy.
Yet the course has two setbacks: 1) The professor stutters through the lectures, displaying his obvious discomfort being on camera; and 2) the overview is very expansive, so there isn't great study in any single theater of Greek civilization.
There is, however, solid coverage.
If you know about data science, data analysis, or machine learning, you may find this class basic or boring.
I liked the assignments and the creative ideas discussed in the class.
It may be the instructors teaching style to get you to research yourself but I could have done that without paying for the course.
You could move more of the content into the third section and balance the time commitment
However, I wish there had been more practical, step-by-step instruction in approaching design work; game artists of more diverse styles; and some discussion of game character design as a career.
He could use real-life examples (disastrous financial decisions in History, GDP of countries, international trade, loans taken by cities or countries, etc), and that would make it so much more engaging (I only remember one question about the price paid for the Manhattan island).
It is a good general overview about recruiting, but I would like more information about staff planning as well, how to forecast the workforce needs.
Even at the reduced price, it seems pricey and this information could be rolled into another course.
It's still perfectly doable but one ends up feeling like you are missing something.
It is too simple and baic
The introduction of how to use github is undetailed in my opinion.
The course should focus more in health professionals
I got bored by the time I got to week 3 and it is seems impossible to stay focused and complete all assignments.
I would prefer someone who feels like actually knowing what he/she says, someone who cut to the chase right away.
Solid academically.
Some of the assignments required use of third party applications and websites that did function as anticipated or are no longer supported.
Peer grading was very poor.
I think this course can be improved with adding small tests between each session and providing several exercises as complimentary material.
Basketball, cycling, running".
I do feel that I learned from this course, though I almost feel that it was too easy to earn the certificate.
I have mixed feelings.
Topic and approach are interesting, however the disturbingly-modulated voice and exaggerated accent of the professor can get a bit unbearable at times and make lectures arduous to follow and enjoy.
questions focused on sentence construction and ordering in a lecture rather than the overall concepts the sentences themselves were expected to convey.
The slides are confusing regarding this matter especially when you translate algorithms into code.
Nonetheless, I liked the assignments overall.
Good introduction and definitely helps get started!
Some parts of the lecture was confusing for beginners.
Too easy to learn
I toggle from one to another, taking notes from the instructional video when possible.
I wish there is some animation film to explain the narative.
I was hoping that by the end of this course, I would have learned about many more options on how to act now, today, as opposed to such a strong emphasis on the origin and meaning of ethics.
Why are you even bothering to read reviews?So I'm giving the course 3/5 stars.
Many errors in the quizzes made this course a disaster, although the course staff was eager to correct them as more complains in the discussions arrived.
one AR lecture is 20 minutes, nearly fell asleep...
The exam answers were not clear....
When should I use a service?
Good material, but the lecture format was very dry and composed primarily of long videos.
Supplementary material is helpful.
Not a very high volume of material.
Using intuition or commonsense is already enough to solve them.
These courses on Ancient Life Evolution are best when they discuss how species developed, how they adapted and how they were discovered.
Instructions were not clear and as a result, most of the assignments I graded didn't meet the scoring matrix...
Going backwards, I think.
The week 5 programs were quite advanced and I would have liked more time spent on explaining them and perhaps a related programming assignment or two to help us learn the material.
The TA's and mentors are clearly under-resourced to answer all our questions.
Fun lectures but the coverage is too simplistic.
The homework assignments were disorganized, provided components contained errors, the grading system had problems and the requirements were often unclear.
Not very motivational but nice,
Took this as part of a Java specialization but would not have taken it otherwise.
However, the implementation of this goal needs significant improvement.
I'm passing them anyway but there must not be question those are not described in videos and in original papers.
Perhaps due to the instructor's legal background.
The fact that other students have to grade each other is not worth the 80 dollars.
I was hoping to come into this course doing quizzes that Prof. Shiller gives his Yale students, but I was completely disappointed.
Moreover, there are some technical issues with the videos.
So the course is a mixed bag.
PROS: The lecture content is useful, albeit a bit dry.
If the person left blank, something needs to be revised.
When mounting a course, you have to take into consideration that there are different levels of students: beginner, intermediate and advanced in the subject matter.
The first week was not to have been given is analysis.
This course sets the stage for the rest of the Data Science specialisation.
You get a lot of textbooks for free and they cover a lot of material.
The quizzes are a little bit underwhelming, especially the first week.
THe german govt is now providing subsidies to art owners who wish to examine the provenance of the art they own so that it can be returned to the heirs of the rightful ownersInvolvement of Swiss (while being neutral) in banking and financial support to Nazis and exploitation of Jews is something that missing here.
In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding.
Reviewing process is quite slow, thus you have to wait until someone review your assignment and grade it, even if you complete this course in just 1 week but you can't pursue certificate in just 1 week because review of assignment 3-4 days minimum for each one.
Coursera should improve that problem, but overall teaching quality was great.
Named "Pay attention " which is unavailable now and I don't understand why has it been removed from Coursera?!
learned something, but not as much as i expected.
But really, to understand graph analytics one should be spending a great deal of time with the subject.
It is focusing too much on the code profile concept without leaving interesting knowledge about that.
Lastly, I can use it only with Python.
This course provides a good overview about virtual instruction and online learning for those who are looking to transition from classroom teaching.
The course material is OK; the lectures are fun and interesting, but to pass the course you need to submit an assignment that is subjected to peer review and you will need to get approval by all of your peers.
Interesting subject, and well-produced videos.
The assignments are however arbitrary and ill-defined, leading to wildly different peer reviews and many who have completed the assignments correctly to be stuck in a grading limbo.
Would not recommend at this point
I missed reading material, since the videos are too short for learning something in a deep way.
Some times it felt like they just kept repeating and rambling, but I did learn the proper documentation for big games.
was it of any overall importance- did it make any difference?
If you have a solid technical (programming, databases, etc.)
The topics include sound signals and sound stimuli and their perception with the human auditory system, differences and likelihood in the perception of vocalization and vocal tones in speech and of music, biological interpretation of scales, and the impact of cultural differences onto music.
The course is rather a prolonged description of the research field than a proper part of general education.
Lacked details on how you go about running a business .. so lets say I wanted to start a business analysis consulting firm besides getting a business number what else do I need to hire people, earn revenue and run the business profitably.
I once had a boyfriend who said my mind was like an encyclopedia that had come free from its binding.
pretty good but expected more of helping writing own programs
Great topic, but the course was less interesting and profound than I expected.
Too short, too easy, and did not result in a project that I can show potential employers.
I am very glad I took the course.
I hope to be able to retake it some time in the future with the right mathematical skills.
This class started out very rocky and the videos had errors, the quizzes had problems, and the assignments had a poor grading system.
Some of the videos weren't as clear as the previous course's videos.
Clear and essenzial focus on the main aspects
got better as I went along.
This course is a useful if superficial introduction.
I am concerned about the last assignment of this course.
The course has excellent homework to help you study, but the course itself sometimes doesn't cover more generally applied knowledge such as red-black BST.
Some parts of the material were very academic and lack enough explanations and examples.
There were issues with accessing comments from peer reviewers and not enough submissions for me to complete all the required peer reviews.
I found the context and explanations by the professor to be very helpful.
Needs more in-depth analysis of loops and type of arguments.
Also I think Java is just a really out-dated, bulky language to work with in this kind of task.
In videos, lecturer explains history and meaning of each piece of art.
Required reading was dramatically different.
This would be very helpful for current college students as the course includes optional readings that are very informative and helpful for a deeper understanding.
THIS COURSE IS INTERESTING,INFORMATIVE AND USEFFUL.
I love the content overall.
Basic introduction to the specialization.
Nice overview for those of us unschooled in the language.
This "less than" experience isn't how most Coursera courses work.
the technicalities are not elucidated by giving practical examples in simple terms.
Quite shallow...
It was valid, but I think the statistics background should be better explored.
3.5 - Good, but I feel some of the explanations were over complicated a little compared to other coursers such as openintro to stats.
Anyway, good course!
The thing that I miss is how to connect the motivation with the set goals.
I was somewhat disappointed in this course as I expected much more "practice".
I don't know.
Parts of videos were distracting and dragged on for longer than necessary.
I am all for short videos but here it is a little bit too short... Tehchnically there is about 1h of videos for the 4 weeks of this course and no real documentations to review.
Hence you get few pointers on how to design game wold for video games and really case studies in my opinion... A full review of one or two games would have been a great addition.
However, this may be just a matter of approach - this approach is also perfectly valid.
Not updated data
I really enjoyed the short segment near the end that delved into the field of biotechnology.
Thank you so much for providing this as a self-paced class, I really enjoyed taking it.
I'm put off quite a bit by the exclusively financial examples
But the videos are a bit boring that sometimes I have a hard time to carry on.
I skipped much of those lessons.
This course is very basic
you will get none this is 100% a java class that just runs in the android environment.
;-)
It lacks the structure to build up a solid foundation of HTML.
Overall the pace and content is good.
You can join the course for certification.
I didn't like the way contents were organized.
I dont like how this course was presented.
Only the final course was little bit challenging.
This seemed like a somewhat outdated course but did have a lot of basic info for people who want to make a game but haven't given it much thought.
Really Thank you for all the big data course, just a little about the 5th course, Graph analytic, I think can must go to the deeper insight with more explanation, some of the modules was really vague!Thank you
This course is beyond abundant in great information.
I was expecting a more in depth, more rigorous course.
Good overview of buddhist meditation
It totally undercuts the apparent validity of the platform.
Nice introduction but don't get too hung up on it.
Perhaps the preparing time for this course is too short?
Although it should be simple enough, i found it hard to understand the material and sometimes, the videos would end without finishing the content.
Hi Team,Course is good.
Videos and contents need to be updated on regular basis, sometimes data discussed is bit outdated.
It gives some good birds eye view of the topic, but I would like to see more in-depth and technical material.
It is not worth 30$
thanks guys.
Felt a little bit overwhelmed.
Challenging with gamification.
Maybe it's a little short.
I was expecting to put in a lot of work in this capstone maybe because I was expecting a more thorough, longer analysis challenge.
So a recommendation is:In the same style, create more weeks where the challenges will increase.
Also, Better examples of functions like lapply, tapply etc.
When reviewing the work of my peers, some of the information did not flow as a project as a whole.
I expected much deeper knowledge for the course.
It was a nice overview but it would also have been interesting to get information (at least some ints) about the long and fascinating Chinese History.
Thanks for your course!
On the other hand, examples are good and explanations properly presented.
The other half of the course is simply learning what each course down the pipeline is about.
It was a good start, but I wish the assignments were a little bit harder.
Overall very appreciated course, Thank Prof. Sachs!
Video resolution is not adopted for smartphone (Asus zenfone 5)
Capstone project methodology is a bit disappointing.
The previous modules were great
As a stay at home mom and experience novice cook since childhood this class was more of a recap of basic cooking for me and a nice reminder of nutritional goals and current standards.
The videos lacks clarity, not loud enough and at instances it's ungrammatical.
Certainly, there ALWAYS WILL be scope of improvement and although, it was moderately enlightening, thank you for producing this course (quite credibly flexible)
Help learners to focus - Body language, and position in the room.
Do that.
Which again is nothing new in the presentation of art but also can meander away from the artists' and art works' intent!
Misleading hints in the assignments, code errors, etc... Also, I found the amount of work required higher, which is not in itself a bad thing, just a bit unexpected.
Some of it did seem to be - here' s a formula, plug the numbers in to get the quiz question right, whereas in reality (in the world of work) that question is completely unrealistic - you have raw data and you need to do the regression and understand what it means.
Had there been some feedback to understand why something is correct or not, I think that would enable more learning.
I also think more emphasis on Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics would help ground this class as a more general class for students interested in robotics.
The instructors are also good, passionate and has a great knowledge.
What brings everything down is the video editing and the slide design/quality.
And then very little time is left to explain the actual new C++ stuff, and he explains it assuming you kind-of know what he's talking about.
Needs to be refreshed and updated.
On the positive side: The content was very interesting.
On the negative side: The course was not particularly well structured.
Also the decimal approximations were very specific to the point where if I didn't type an extra number in the tenths, hundredths, or thousandths place then I would get the answer wrong even if I did the problem correctly.
Algorithms in lectures were useless to programming assignment
Course give very good information, but the "The addicted brain" its not the correct name.
Second part of the course give more detail information about different drugs and body biology, but its not directly related to the Brain.
However, the training its very good, just change the label.
It accomplishes the main goal: help with the leap from C to C++, but:- It's damn slow.
Not impressed.
Most of the materials are more theoretical (some of the graphs are not necessary and does not help understanding the discussing topic and increases confusion.
This course can be improved by adding a few in-depth case studies to the weekly assignments.
it was good, could be more dinamic though
I thought weeks on Gaussian Model Learning and Robot Mapping were neat.
How can you learn something just copying lines of code and making minor changes?
That is about as incomplete as the approach of focusing only on the pathology.
Overall, a good experience.
Quick note of speaking speed: I understand that reading slowly is best sometimes, but Prof. Oakley is EXTREMELY slow, so much so, that I watched the videos at 1.25x and still felt like she was speaking at slightly slower speed than a normal person..
Some end up in calculating one figure per research question, without any attempt at deriving trends or patterns, others do not include any plots at all,...
This would not serve as a great course for into to data science.
it seems this is not a course for me to rate based on content.
You need basic understanding of Excel to follow the course.
The material is OK, but it just felt so boring
I found myself reading the transcripts because I could not watch the videos without feeling like I was being talked down to or that the instructor didn't take the course seriously.
Full Individuals speaking
There is no direction or lead in to best practices.
It was ok, rather basic really, but I suppose that is what some people need.
good quick overview, could have more actual R examples in lectures
well!
Good beginner course!
Good that it was not in the final project.
Course is interesting, but tasks are way too easy.
Very nice course, active forum, no issues technical or otherwise -but- it is more about science than Philosophy.
Hopefully next one remains great quality but with more content :)
Its real subject is certain topics in biology, not music.
I did not like that I had to write down pretty much every single word from each slide and that was said in order to make sure I could answer the quiz questions.
In my opinion this course is superficial.
My sense is that if you have some experience in the actual topics covered by the course, and are looking to verify your knowledge with a certificate, you will be fine.
Main problem is that the lecture videos are unscripted and could easily be made more concise.
Presenter seemed a little unsure of what he was presenting by times
It´s worth it.
Reading from power-point slides which are written in the same manner, have identical structure tends to become tedious after a while.
Basically, they just say, "Go do this.
I suppose the three lecturers are incredible good in their respective fields, but in the teaching part, Some Shoham's lessons were like listening to a robot.
Gooed clear presenters.
This course is for newbee only.
It'll require from students some efforts to create the right picture in their minds.
Exercises are great and partially make up for the above mentioned shortcomings.
Some example code is very bad and goes against all the 'good' things being taught by Martin in the first course of the specialization.
However, 1.
Wish they gave more clear information on the calcuations.
Ok.
I thought the content was great, but I thought the assignments were too onerous.
4 out of 6 quizzes didn't allow to see which questions were right or wrong.
No advanced info about Angrular.
If NLP is a prerequisite for this capstone project - whether in the form of a prior class or textbook knowledge - this should be indicated clearly on the course description page.
Nevertheless, the main learning that I achieved with this course was in the area of software engineering - specifically, how to take advantage of vectorization in R to achieve reasonable computing performance.
This is a course for those who have not spent any time delving into comparative religion and testing their own traditional (family taught) belief systems with thoughts of act versus "trut."
So, I encourage showcasing different approaches from already experienced salespeople from a wide range of personalities.
Despite the low quality of the quizzes, the course is very inspiring.
some of the videos were outstanding and easy to understand.
I still came away learning, but it did not feel very structured.
The last assignment caused me CONFUSION.
I will most likely still take more from IE Business School, but at least will be prepared for printing out the text of the videos instead of stressing over trying to figure out what was said.
This makes it very difficult to parse the content, and think about how to create applied applications.
Assignments are challenging enough for beginners like me but I like that.
I think it could have less videos teaching how to install Python and more about the language principles.
The videos were interesting and of sufficient length not to strain my attention.
There are no lectures on Services, and Content Providers which are two key components of the Android system.
I expect that, for an in-person course, this instructor gives individualized feedback that provides that content.
I understand nothing of it.
The last week was not up to scratch, readings from the popular press, not experts.
The course starts with a nice mathematical support.
It can also use more interactive examples as this is a more executive view instead of having scholar examples.
This is a valuable course which tells you new innovative concepts about digital marketing, but I think many ideas introduced here are going to work for large businesses.
Some lectures did give a good background and high level understanding of Construction Project Management, but expected a bit more in depth info.
Last lesson/assignment required more research on my part as it required general construction knowledge.
Still, it introduced some solid concepts for professionals and scholars, alike.
Course content was not of that much strength.
trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each?
LOVED but wish it would have been more in depth and less of an overview of other services
Yet it is only an introductory course for the IoT specialization.
I like the assignments from this course, these assignments job help me recall what learned in the courses.
Most of the course is a little superficial.
On the other hand, the lectures were mostly at a superficial level, so I'm not sure that technical people would get much out of them either.
Structured Course that gives beginner to intermediate level expertise.
: Management strategies, common difficulties,...).
Also certain parts of the Consumer Behaviour section were quite repetitive.
On the flip side, I gained a lot of knowledge by putting forth full effort.
The course structure is okay and availability of course material e-book is big plus for the course.
However there are negatives also.
This is a course on "Digital Marketing" and it has to be taken to great heights in terms of content and delivery.
Most critical issue is delivery.
No to processed food!!
Was quite good but getting less and less useful, too abstract, lacking detail.
I generally just avoid the videos and read the slides.
This provide general knowledge to create simple web pages, some basic HTML tags and a few practices.
This course is better than Statistical Inference, and I think it is as useful.
This course has a very nice content.
The course is well structured, but most of the features in the exercises' pages were not working properly.
It is very error prone and tedious.
Was Super Boring Course Im sorry.
I feel like it was rather short and not too detailed
The sound volume is very low
Nevertheless, it says that it doesn't require any previous experience...
Though the content is great, it is kind of messy altogether!
The course content is good, but doing the programming assignments needs to be more clarified.
OK, but obvious for someone who has worked with data science.
Not good enough.
I even felt like I was watching its commercial sometimes.
I think entire course could have been covered in a week or at most two weeks.
Otherwise he sounds like repeating something that he's so well memorized after many years of teaching.
And would suggest seeking out a course that has some kind of proctor or supervisory help available.
Good course, teaches how are actually big dairy enterprises, in a country with unlimited resources, it`s not usefull in develeping countries, and doesn`t teach how to understand the way to start a business and the differences in small, medium, big and gigantic business in diary production.
Too easy, for novices in programming
The free course is very short and only give a generalized information of the cybersecurity word.
I like this mam teaching
The content is helpful in learning to use the camera and understand terminology, but it is somewhat, if not totally, a false representation of interaction with the experts.
A very basic overview on Data Science.
It is not a beginner friendly course.
Interesting but didn't explain in depth many of the topics.
There are some ideas expressed in video that I found helpful.
too short, I prefer that the engineer share a little experience or make more in detail.
These are only those who have previous knowledge that can pass it the first time they take it.
I like the course content but the presenter needs to have a more friendly way to present it.
However, it was very basic.
The Capstone was adequate, but I had hope for a bit more of a challenge.
Interesting approach, but I expected more useful information on gastronomy
Anyway it was interesting and now I'm really intrigued about how I can apply this new knowledge to real everyday development tasks.
(By the way, it's a mistake to take such a long break.
A case study or example which would navigate students through all 6 modules would greatly help students remembering it all.
Sometime the video sound is too quiet (but you can read the transcript when it happened.)
It's alright, but could be much much better.
This is a very basic course.
The content is good but the contents have a lot of overlap.
A broad collection of different subjects.
This is a good course, but being a professional in the software industry, I know many of the teachings described here.
Basic content that do not explain how business models are applied in digital world
I feel that the course could've been organized a little better (and if I had it to do over I would check out the Reading a Case very early on in the course.)
It was made 10 years back.
I was considering taking the later courses in the specialization, but I'm afraid that without real grading I won't learn as much as if I learn more slowly outside of Coursera.
Too abstract with too much general information
Lot of emphasis on remembering things rather than understanding how they work.
i need android programming based course specially in xamrin / visual studio ........... i feel so much disappointment .
There is also no option to re-take the final assignment, which was peer-graded and I believe I was not properly evaluated by my peers.
Other teachers were great though.
So I doubt I will finish the certificate because the final course relies only on student feedback which is non-existent.
Some good tips, nothing terribly new for those who have had a course in statistics.
It is difficult to complain too much about a free course, but I expected more from a course carrying the name Princeton.
This needs to be sorted out I feel, as it has marred this course for me.
but can hardly used in daily
Though I can adjust it and lower the volume, but sudden high volume sound is discouraging when the next video has normal volume causing me to adjust it again.
I was only able to watch few of the videos but they are good.
Content is okay, but can't help the feeling that it's basically a cash cow - students would benefit a lot if instructors were move involved.
I was quite frustrated from time to time that some important and difficult points are not really justified or explained in details, but just given as assumption or obvious concept: If you are familiar with that concept, you will be fine (but probably won't learn that much), while if you are not you will be probably lost.
I hope this will be helpful.
I wouldn't recommend it.
Actually, the course should be titled as "Introduction Into Macroeconomics", I think.
Very intersting
Some points are clearly explained.
Lack of examples.
Also the audio-quality is poor.
Unclear and incomplete instructions for assignments.
It could be better.
Should have stuck with the historical progression of Modern Art--tried and true approach.
Did not learn that much through that course.
I find the videos are overly formal and traditional in their rhetorical style.
I didn't find the speaker very engaging.
I will be doing the whole specialization but there moments that I get so bored and unmotivated, I have to force myself to keep going.
We always expect to learn the latest trend and current examples.
Good content
Sometimes too easy, but may be good as a start point.
These are the foundations of statistical analysis, and unfortunately there's a lot of statistics jargon that students aren't going to be familiar with in here.
Of course I knew they did research, but I thought they were primarily there to teach.
This wouldn't be an issue in and of itself, but there were quite a number of issues with the presentation, from questions appearing in the wrong video, to badly worded and misleading questions.
This course seemed a bit spread too thin.
I found many inconsistency in the solutions although I guessed it by spending a lot of time to pass this course.
Everything else - not very good.
Good overall but you should use better microphone, because sometimes it's hard to understand and improve your English.
The teacher was great, she speaks very clear and explain well
I was disappointed by the lack of response from teachers to the consultations
On one hand he's very knowledgable and communicates a lot of really good information.
As a "newbie" to the Coursera community, I wanted to take a course that would expand my knowledge of art and culture while fitting within my hectic work and family schedule.
is very misleading and if you do not have any experience, you will struggle a lot especially to complete week 3 & 4 assignments.
It makes you think and requires a lot of self-study, which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skills, however assignments are way too challenging for those who are 'beginners' or have little real-world experience.
To make it better, I'd Include more walkthroughs for Git and GitHub.
it is good but a lot more citations and examples could be included
The interviews with software product managers were interesting, as well as the supplemental materials (TEDtalks, reads).
This course is very introductory, with limited depth in the programming assignments.
The content felt very random and esoteric at times.
An interesting class that traces the origins of Buddhist meditation and the Western usage today.
This is a very short, but useful and highly practical course.
This course is an overview of SEO and doesn't go into a lot of detail of how SEO is actually implemented on the site.
The course is interesting, but in the other hand is too basic, If you already have some knowledge about negotiationg it wont give you a lot of knowledge.
Even though these assignments were truly challenging and difficult to complete, the course complied with some of the proposed objectives.
during the course.
Don't take the grading seriously.
The professor of this course expects you to read his mind too much, preferring to skip through explaining his reasoning for solving some problems, such as calculating risk with the Empirical rule.
I understand peer review is a bit difficult, but being quiz only made this course a bit too easy.
Audio quality is not great.
nice course but i was expecting more about actors and futures
I actually enjoyed this class very much, but it doesn't go very deep in the topic.
Very basic course!
inference).
The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms.
Imagine that learning is about climbing a mountain in which tall steps have been carved.
Deep lectures, but exercises where more about complex problems than about parallel programing
real excersices to really understand the theory.
Please revise this course, you have nice video edition and the teacher is good, and willing to teach, but the global course is missing several things.
Provide more details for reference purposes.
The last 2 weeks were great!
Nice addition to the "Competitive Strategy" course, although not as interesting and practical as the first part... Cases and current examples would have made this section much better.
Prof.
Wouldn't recommend to pay for this.
Only by chance you can eventually write the new introduction touching the points that count for grading.
For people growing up with the space race it has a lot of interesting video and written material.
But there are a lot of simple errors in the material and the assignments.
I was hoping for something a little more technical.
Way too theoretical.
Could have made it more interesting
It's halfway through the course and 2 out of 3 of my assignments haven't been graded because of other students not doing it.
There is a requirement to use Adobe Illustrator which is a real pain if you've never used it before and the timescales are tight - it's a 4 weeks course with weekly assignments.
Learnt many new things.
Flawed; but still a really interesting course.
After submitting my work, I discovered that there are requirements that were not in the assignment.
Description could be little more elaborate.
It's very very basic, I know it's considered an introductory course but I expected more.
Great job on the course material and labs, quizzes and the final exame however, tend to be very confusing.
Somewhat too simple, but still a good basic introduction.
The exercises ae far more advanced than the lectures and study materials.
It's a general overview that introduces all aspects of Autism Spectrum Disorder which is exactly what I wanted.
The specialization all together helped me get a better grip on Python Basics.
The lecture material was high level, and didn't seem to be a good preparation for the quizzes.
The description for the final project was not very detailed, and the grading rubric likewise was not very specific for peer review.
The professor knows a lot, but it could be a more deep course rather than just a introduction.
:/
I hope by studying the following courses, contents of this course prove to be more practical.
This course isn't as clearly outlined or carefully prepared as the others in the Data Visualization specialization.
The peer review sysetm however relies on the experience and knowledge of others which is a flaw in how some of the coursera modules are evaluated.
If you are looking to expand your technical knowledge, opt for a course the has an automated test system (such as the courses on Data Structures and Algorithms).
If you are just considering studying engineering, this course and specialization will be a decent and simplistic introduction into the field.
Lots of very general review information, not much new stuff.
It is a bit too much workshop style and lacking a bit the academic structure and content.
I will continue with the specialization with the hope in the next courses the topics are covered in higher detail.
Good course for learning the basics of the caret package.
The View on Mobile app and Desktop is so different.
It is difficult to write such a course for all possible entrepreneurial ventures there may exist, but I found the strong reference to ICT and technological innovations difficult to apply to my own venture.
But 2 disappointing factors could have been avoided to make this course perfect1- sound is almost in one ear which can make you feel dizzy if you are using headset.2- instructor is reading everything like a robot.
Provides good tips for how to inc
However, the tools could have been described
In my opinion the positive thing of this course is bringing a very important area to Coursera.
There's very little of the engagement that would really make this interesting.
materials/lectures are brief and could go deeper.
Too many "ums" and "ahs".
Great course to get an introduction into the world of finance and it's multiple faces.
Hope recommend some more reading
The lecturer is very good, but the contents are basic.
The course gave a good introduction but with little proofs or derivation.
The evaluation part of the course needs some fixing.
Overall, pretty good.
However, it was definitely a shock to find myself missing those things that one typically finds in a learning environment -- descriptive background, assistance to problems, etc.
Not enough exercises.
For all of you who made it to week03 assignment, you can applaud yourselves.
Sadly, the assignment design of this course is very disappointing.
But I really wanted a more rigorous methodology - and didn't really get it here.
It's awesome ,
Nice approach, needed more organized content!
Do you know why there are 42 topics in week 3 and only 7 in week 5?
Informative, but needs more challenging assignments.
That felt a bit cheap, considering that courses are not really free anymore.
The main problem here is that quizzes will sometimes cover subjects not introduced until the following week.
Some of the SCRUM, XP & Agile Practices can be better explained.
If you found an audience out there somewhere who had not heard these messages, then you have succeeded and I applaud you for that.
I think that the above course was a little bored.
Good course for basic information about digital analytics.
Open any week's discussion forum, you will find out that 90% questions and problems are about Java, not algorithms.
The follow along practice queries and end of lesson practice problems were also helpful interactives for the student.
However there were mistakes in the answer keys or practice problem prompts that became more frequent in the lessons towards the end of the course.
I think the notes given after the lectures should contain the formula the students need.
Some answers can be found in the book (but the book supposedly is not required).
Maybe just too much/too long?
Helpful ideas, but could use some more practical suggestions.
More examples for different levels needed
difficult for people without accounting background to take.
This is a very good course to grasp the fundamentals of the various forms of energy.
Admin detail: one week between exam-taking after two fails makes no practical sense and is detrimental to the timely completion of the course.
The course would also benefit from an actualization, with more analysis of recent economic & political trends:- Oil market has historically been cyclical.
An excellent course as a short overview or as an introduction to a specialization.
Seemed to touch on neurology and evolution more than genetics.
But later ones are good for understanding the structure of data.
I actually might, but ONLY because of its place in the overall certification.
As someone from another country without health problems, there was not much here.
The quizzes tend to focus on irrelevant details from the videos (probably something to do with the instructors focus on "observation" which seems to mean trying to remember all irrelevant details).
Additionally, the tutorials for using the statistical software do not lend themselves towards a thorough understanding and more to a route learning.
Good luck!
The course covers all the necessary theoretical basica of statistics and modeling but isn't very helpful in terms of practical implementation.
Good introduction to the Theme.
A link to a resume or something might be better.
I did enjoy the Radiohead, Threadless, and Thingiverse exercises and learn from them.
if i evaluate this course dispassionately then i don't think there is much difference between watching this course and reading a 5-10 page article.
Interesting but uneven.
The course sped through the coding portions while spending a lot of time on the theoretical side of how the Internet works.
Valuable information, nonetheless.
The third was a bit confusing and the 4th one just felt like padding.
I think I was already at the point where I don't need an actual pomodoro timer to get into that mindset.
And many people used a small circle and a large circle putting at the center vertically to form a scale composition, and you have to give them 3 points because they followed the instructions, but they actually did not do much in terms of composition.
It teaches an interesting topic, but it's a bit hard to follow the teacher.
I believe this course can be performed much faster, beware that it is really an introduction, and IT professionals persons may feel it slow, in addition the presenter speaks English very slowly, good for non English proficient persons, but bad for the others.
still good course though!
Class materials and videos are confusing and do not go into enough detail.
Despite its shortcomings, the course is still a powerful introduction to Systems Biology.
I watch the videos after work when I get home and Jennifer Carbrey puts me to sleep.
It is quite basic and sometimes the quiz can be a little confusing.
In comparison to other courses, I felt this was a little too superficial for the true challenges of Information Design.
And I'd like to see the characters to start learning how some words are written.
It was a little short and the quizzes and short assignments are too easy, so they do not really cement your knowledge of the programming concepts.
The course is too much focused on the U.
S.
case studies are a little bit outdated.
expected more programs to be taught and more experiments to be shown, disappointing
I doubt that's useful as the staff claim (I simply skipped one week and continued normally).• The professor insists repeatedly on a grandiose, philosophical, cheesy view of finance (how it'll make your life so much better, how it's applicable to so many aspects, how money isn't everything) but, in my opinion, betrays that spirit from day one by sticking to the most obvious applications and examples.
The assignments are not well aligned with the swirl learning or the videos.
al.
I have seen most of the questions just being discussed among the students.
It would be helpful to speak more slowly and pause more often.
How different in costs and profit are diary in different countries?, How USA government helps diary business in USA?
Another primary complaint is that many of the quiz questions are are poorly written, requiring assumptions to be made outside of the information presented with the question.
Good Course and Professor very clear.
Difficult to follow at times.
Not up-to the expectation.
While the last module of this course is very interesting and kept with the specialization, the first 5 modules are a waste of time for the most part.
It is too short to cover more fundamental topics in machine learning, like how to choose an algorithm based on the problem and the data.
I took this class just because I was engaged in the Data Science specialization.
This course is super fast for beginner and i colder find the pause button.
The speaker was very difficult to follow with dialogue flow, random pauses, and stumbling over words.
If you are interested in the math behind or mainly neural networks (which are only covered briefly), this is not the course for you.
Beware of the final unit (week 4): the takeaways and the final quiz are not well aligned.
Should Make courses audit
Fairly good.
Sometimes it seems very "mechanic".
I started to doing the each chapter's problems before moving on in the week.
I found this demotivating.
May be too wide in terms of issues
Still there are very usefull parts in this course.
Content is interesting but the lectures and the content is far below the first course in the series in my opinion.
I qualify this in stating that I have not yet completed the next two courses on PGMs; this course may present an essential foundation that is necessary for the upcoming courses, and in any case provoked my interest in learning more about them
You definitely need some R background by the end for the project.
Thanks for writing the new feature about the java8 for free.
But for most lessons it is too easy to learn.
And week 4 is even worse, I had to use pen and paper and then explain only 1 of the core mechanics (even that used more than expected weekly hour work).
Some of the quizzes are not fully clear if you are not a native English speaker.
Course was helpful but final test was poorly worded and very confusing.
There is a short segment in here on Financial services which i found to be a bit misplaced, and I would have liked more detail on the business metrics side as well as on the financial services side (if it is indeed well placed and I just didn't catch the correlation).
(IMHO)
It's way to easy to be a separate course.
Hopefully, University of London will improve with future courses.
Could be completed in a single day but spread across 4 weeks.
The last week has materials that nothing related to assignment, and it jumps a bit fast where i have no clue at all
Moreover, it seems there are many incorrect part in the assignment especially optional code assignments.
A little too high-level for what I was looking for but a good introduction to get familiarized with some of the terminology and concepts.
Week 4 has no programming assignment and a short class and 5 has a weak programming assignment and no class.
While I am aware that this is an overview of the other courses in the specialization, I felt that the quizzes and programming exercises didn't really get into the actual topic.
Simple and clear explanations to solve problems.
software engineer like myself).
Yes there're some pronunciation tips and situational conversation practice to help you get started, but in speaking of helping students to become a "professional“ English speaker, I think the course still has a long way to go.
That said it was still a good course.
i had to wait several days before this was possible (other videos from other sites were OK so must have been local to you and not a fault at my end) Then when I could access the site again I found I could not reconnect with the course at the level at which I had left it but would have to start again.
It would be more conducive that lecturer expands more on the cutting edge study and research, to give people a sense of the finding of the field and its benefits.
If so, why?Bill Clark
I expected to get more detailed information on children's rights while sometimes the presentations were only very general overviews.
Good basics!
This course was a challenge.
This might be a great course for those who don't have any previous background in Finance/Business.
The course will give you a very introductory observations about modern finance.
And the course becomes too extra factors and complexity on later classes, it made me to lose the interest on the algorithm and course.
I cannot complete it because of these two factors
All in all it's clear that a lot of work has gone into this course, and that is definitely to be commended by all involved.
The concepts are explained very well.
Assignments are very easy, and there aren't easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos.
An excellent course for students that require, or want intricate detail on the subject.
it is too complicated for me this courese, not very useful for daily work.
The comparaison between Chinese and Western Culture was really useful.
I learnt much but only rated 3 stars because students are unable to submit their assignments or receive peer group or mentor feedback unless a payment is made.
The course is bit fast i guess or may be all the courses are like this only since this is my first course.
I learned a lot, but felt like I DID less than in the previous specialization courses.
The Full Stack Web Development course is somewhat like that.
It is not any technical 'lab based exercise bases I mean'
If you are looking for more of the big history overview concept this may not be the best course for you.
I learned a lot from the exercises in the other parts of the specialization.
Overall it is basic, speaker could talk faster and in general the course could move a lot faster.
I got passed this course with 95 and will continue taking the rest of the courses in this specialization because I already paid the whole specialization package and supported by my company.
It may be the way to teach for in-person learning but it is frustrating for an online course.
this course helped me so much in realizing and organizing my time.
I can't imagine using them in my day to day, so it just felt like a waste of time.
I suggest that Coursera work with the instructor to retain the current content, but produce much richer lectures that have concepts and principles which students can put into practice even after the course ends.
It should focus more on concepts and techniques for delivering richer and meaningful graphics using ggplot rather than talking that much about technicalities on the basic plot and lattice systems.
Assignments were too basic and don't reflect all the concepts learned in the lessons e.
g.
If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments, this course would not have been nearly as frustrating; challenging assignments, I agree, are crucial for learning the material well.
Too complicated for those who are new to philosophy.
This was a hard course and many of the exercises did not have enough details to complete the assignments on time.
(as does it give the correct answer" the staff does not provide the correct answer...
Also, it seemed less adapted to the format than other courses such as Machine Learning by Andrew Ng and Computational Neuroscience by Rajesh Rao.
Not much usefull to the reality
Quiz does not require hands-on experience of creating templates but rather simply plugging in numbers.
Lecture videos now split from 10-14 minutes into lots of 4-6 minute videos.
Could have done much more like integrating front-end etc in place of that loopback module.
This is particularly disturbing for products like probiotics, which have become a huge industry with little solid evidence to support them, or to choose between them.
I suggest to give example of a business idea analysis and also lecture on it.
Finally, there are several "NOT" or 'opposite answer' questions which are valid but confusing, so the student must be careful when answering.
Recommendations: 1.
A good introductory course to the world of VC but fails to provide a deep enough dive into issues of internal VC/PE deal flow evaluation, processes.
Some interesting content and great softwares/tools.
Unfortunately, the course instructors ignore the all-too-common psychological biases some people have about others based upon race, gender, age, orientation, etc.
I don't like this course , because the homework can not match the lesson.
I feel this was meant to be a collaborative tool for us to use, but instead turned out to be a rather awkward device.
thank u a lot Maya.
somehow I feel the course materials were not prepared well also it was not effective presentation, it was more like a reading a presentation
Too easy
The basics covered in this course were useful, however there was minimal interaction with instructors.
More matter should be covered in this course.
Was only videos and 2 question quizzes until the very end.
Of course, I could have been wrong about it but, but based on the response from other students I was not the only one having this problem.
The structure and topic list is okay, but the depth is not enough to threat the course as "advanced".
Good lessons but the issue for me was that some of the video content was a little outdated.
Arguments brought up are shallow
It was filled with a lot of interesting, pertinent information but I did feel that there was not enough variety in terms of interviews and I do wish that she had delved more into some of the topics.
However, from some of the griping, I am not alone.
I was hoping for something a little more detailed.
It's ok that the instructor always talks fast, but he stammered a lot.
Scattered and lacking focus.
The first time, did not get the minimum score.
Terribly boring.
I would rate this class as "entry level" for anybody with a college-level technical degree.
I feel there are times when the grading criteria don't exactly match the requested assignment.
While I get the motivation, I think it'd be better to give a more experiential learning platform - more swirl type exercises but deeper - to guide the student to the most efficient path to competency.
Like the weekly lessons are easy and then the wall goes up in the task at week 5.
This also occurs in the quizzes, causing me to either misunderstand or not understand the questions.
Overall, it is a very interesting course but the 'execution' is not up to standard.
The video lectures just didn't have enough meat to them.
Interesting lecture series.
Thanks for providing lots of interesting materials!
Worth the time, if you quickly breeze through it.
I think the information in this course is well organized and the delivery is good.
I wish more people would take this course.
Some useful frameworks but would have preferred to see more time spent addressing models and frameworks for testing the potential success of new ideas and comparing between different ideas.
Fun.
Good overview of machine learning.
Distracting background.
Content is good but honours assignments are unclear and no help from mentors in the discussion forums - more time-consuming than they should be
No technical support is provided for VM issues.
Was too hard and too much.
The subject covered is interesting, but could be more deeper.
Eh, not great to be honest.
Having read numerous books on Lean Thinking, Agile development, Minimum Viable Propositions, etc.
If it would cost lest, than it would be ok.
But most of the time he just throw us some result without properly setting the context and concepts, as if it was understood that we already know most of what he is talking about.
The basic concepts not very clearly explained.
But especially Assignement 3 regarding cleaning the data should be improved.
I liked it!The only problem is a webcam that a lot of people do not have.
For prospective students who are looking to enter the biostatistics/epidemiology field in the future.
I do not, however, feel it would hold much value as a stand alone course.
I am not sure how you would achieve it given the asynchronous nature of the medium, but I would love more opportunities for feedback and discussion.
Though I think it could go deeper into some topics and explain a little more beyond just giving examples, videos are good but a little short, each week is roughly 20 minutes long each.
Too fundamental, too easy.
Great introduction to Accounting Analytics.
The markov assignment is a actual assignment copied from the CS201 course in Duke.
But reviewing a quiz without paying would be useful even for people who don`t pay.
I'm hoping that the coverage of course material to assignment requirements is a lot better in the subsequent courses in this specialization.
It is a good introductory course.
Also, they devote a lot of time to selling the American Gut Project.
I think he's a fantastic and well-versed instructor in the Data & Analytics realm and am eager to find ways I can use what I've learned into practice at work.
You might as well watch videos on YouTube or better yet get on Khan Academy.
Enjoyed the lectures.
The instructor does an excellent job, but realistically there is no way to be proficient enough in a 3D software program after a week or two to earn a certificate.
What I was impressed was the supplementary reading linked to an online article - you are not doing things by saving time but the time will save itself if you
I just cannot believe in Raj's theories when they are so weak and therefore this course will in no way increase my level of happiness.
Severance is a good lecturer but necessary to read all notes and the book chapter in addition to the lecture in order to understand the principles.
Definitely not for begginers, as some knowledge of physics, differential equations, calculus, matlab programming is highly recommended!
I thought at times the explanations were a bit concise.
Most of the value comes from working on games for the assignments.
Course is enjoyable and interesting so far.
Although the lectures themselves are clear enough, the quizzes are sometime so confusing and don't reflect the way that topic was taught.
There are not enough assignments which motivate studying and fixing the newly learned things in the memory.
Very interesting course, yet course content could be spread more evenly (week 4 is really a lot)
Good review of fundamentals but not a lot of depth.
The programming assignments are mostly pointless.
There is no specialaization in this kind of coures us I expected, because I am a food technologist, I kwnow most of the parts, but still it is really helpfull and interestin!
Really appreciate that.
thanks to prof and cousera for this wonderful course.
not bad but not excellent
He errs on the side of overly-detailed explanation, which to me is preferable to skipping over subjects or techniques and assuming you know them.
Having said all of this, I repeat that there is good material, and you can learn the fundamentals of calculus for free in this course.
The level of presentation seems rudimentary to me.
it could be easily compressed in a two-weeks course.
Sometimes interviews are too long for what they need to explain.
Instructors should reference more external readings since the lectures are brief.
Not really a course, should just be Week 1 in course 2
The assignment material (mainly pdfs) sometimes had typos which made solving them a bit confusing and more time consuming without actually being very difficult.
It is very simple course.
However, when I wanted to go back and reread for clarification, I found the transcript to be poorly edited and at times almost unintelligible.
I wish videos were longer since I prefer to listen more than to read.
It was a fun course, not sure about the educational content, but it was fun.
the course, probably, was good, but it was presented in rather boring and slow manner, so in the end I completely lost interest, and was skipping through the lectures.
If it could be done in more lively and engaging manner, it would have been great
I should not be part of a basic statistics course.
I was expecting the course to provide insight on how to use spread sheet and its respective formulae in mathematical modelling.
The majority will do the minimum to finish the course.
It would be more efficient to push all students to make hard plots in Matplotlib (interactive + animation) with strict rules.
This is not a level of an intermediate course!
I feel like there wasn't enough time to complete the assignment as we had in the previous courses.
If I'm already 'investing' my time into something I expect to learn something in return.
i feel this courses needs to be split into two different streams.
Hope they can add more stuff!
The content of the course is very nice.
I learned, but not sufficient for the 4 hours per week that I invested.
However, he was very thorough and informative.
For example, level design is mentioned.
And the most important thing while learning this course is to practicing and applying it into reality, which is really amazing~~
I think that the course itself is very interesting and useful, but unfortunately you have to purchase the course straight away to be able to do the tests.
This a decent course, perhaps something I should go back through and do again.
Swirl exercises are important for this course
really interesting but also really difficult to finish the assignment.
(a lot of number crunching and no room for little numerical mistake although reasoning is good)
That was a pretty good introduction on how various systems work, together with a nice practical tutorial.
Information was good, a bit dry at points and the presenter didn't seem that enthused to be presenting.
This is a required course in the Data Science specialization.
Sometimes, the material seems too simplistic.
By that same token, can I really pass a student who has met the course criteria, yet has mis-spelled many words, has little or no punctuation and has jumbled tenses all over the place.
Hardly any assignment took me more than an hour to complete.
The material is very interesting, but the course goes very fast, and the presentation is dry.
Only brief course.
A huge gap.
This is unacceptable in a digital marketing college level course because the technology evolution cycle is getting shorter with each passing year and some of the case study examples are now obsolete.
I've taken to listening to the lectures while doing something else, and then parsing the transcripts, trying to tease out some sort of linear narrative for my notes and it's just so effortful and time-consuming.
( for example I calculate returns of a stock Q using CAPM and I get 15%, then how should I interpret this in the real market scenario where I am investing in the middle of the fiscal year.
Otherwise, don't expect to get much about the ~30 minutes of lecture.
The teacher explained excellent and the topics were very appropiate.
I very much enjoyed the idea of studying positive Psychology, but after a few class I realized it was very much common sense.
The lessons taught were great and the knowledge I acquired was exactly what I was looking for, it was just the accents that were hard to decifer.
Best part of course was actually the text notes at the beginning of each sesssion.
Assignments need to be challenging.
I never received any feedback from the TA's and when I submitted to MeTa support, they said the school design the programs so they can't help.
If you want thorough theoretical background information, this class would be a better fit.
The use of RNA secondary structure alignment as an example of dynamic programming implementation is overkill.
Mistakes within quizzes.
I understand it costs to have someon
I thoroughly enjoyed it.
My comments are critical but hopefully helpful and all your work is appreciated.
It is unfortunate, because I was eagerly waiting for the course.
The teacher sometimes explain the concepts in a hard way, and not always shows how to do in practice.
But you will get curious and in case of doubts, you can find more simple explanations on the web, and the forum is very good.
The assignments are hard, you will need do research to accomplish then, but is the best way to learn.
I think the specialization is good to someone without much knowledge on the field (like me).
The major problem with this course is that, as complex as it is, coupled with the lack of access to the instructors to ask questions, perhaps the assistants could be more responsive and helpful with problems students are having problems with.
Nice course.
But the week 5 project is a little vague.
Good Introduction
I have been in other courses in Coursera and have found the input from tutors really reassuring because I am getting expert feedback.
I would have more quizzes and harder questions.
For a paid course, you would expect the labs to be better quality tested.
I really like to the content of the course, but the problem of it is that it does not really incorporate the legal skills one acquires from Law School and is thus somewhat of a false representation of the case law that is offered.
The amount of useful concepts introduced in the first 5 modules won't take more than 15 minutes if unnecessary things were removed.
It didn't help maintain my interest in the course I was taking currently.
Quotes from pieces of legislation, judgements from various courts, quotes from politicians etc.
The course was useful in providing an introduction to the basics of game theory.
However it would benefit from a native English proofread and smoother delivery.
There were also problems throughout regarding the display of graphics and notes behind the professor, who kept pointing to something other than he was referring to.
A couple of math notations were also incorrect, for example "<" when the professor said "less than or equal to".
Overall though, I'm pleased that I took the course and I learned several important aspects of the topic that will benefit me in future study.
A little light on content but I still learned a lot
The final test has little to do with the course.
Especially nice are all the videos demonstrating what have been done so far.
Problem are the assignments:-all the assignments are about controlling a quadrotor, but a matlab code 95% done is already provided and most of the times the only thing requested is to spend days in find (randomly) the correct values for the controller gains;-the last assignment is again partly about (randomly) looking for gain values and partly about generating a trajectory as a piecewise 7th order polynomial, where the method for creating such thing is only mentioned in the assignment pdf and with wrong conditions.
Tedious introduction, delayed second week.
Basic stuff.
Good choice of subjects.
A little too short.
I could not finish this course, although I admire the teacher for preparing this difficult material for English speakers.
It would be really nice if there was something like handouts, pdf readings for deeper understanding of the concepts on offline times.
Interesting course, however more examples could be included
If they are to remain part of this course, they really should be treated as supplementary and not required to complete the course.
Why did Coursera split it to another course?
All in all a good course but can be improved.
I think this course is a relatively well put together, gentle introduction to machine learning.
It was a bit fast and some things were not well explained but other than that a great course, love courseera already!
The course does not have much videos and some of the lecturers (especailly week 5) talk TOO FAST.
It did not meet assignment rubric.
Perhaps spread out to other modules as short background material.
Would have preferred history/overview from Internet age with focus on various protocols/technologies that were introduced (IP, TCP, UDP, MQTT, Thread, Bluetooth, ZigbeeModule 6 made up for its more dynamic and more germane presentation.
I think the tool and the messiness of the assignment make this Specialisation not up to the task, sorry.
Very factual.
I could pass the course somehow by writing the code presented in the lecture, but I must say I understand less than the half of the course contents.###Responding to question from the instructor, I clarify the comments above.
I found the whole lecture difficult.
I would have preferred a little less and a few more in depth analysis.
Impressive archives collection, definitely a plus of this course.
I could understand a week but 4 seems silly.
One section that I did find incredibly helpful was the discussion about the different types of fats.
As it stands, I would definitely recommend this course to a client, friend, or family member starting out at a beginner's level (like my fiance) or anyone who needs a refresher.
It would have been nice if additional (optional) readings were listed to give interested students more direction.
Succinct, relevant & lively coverage of topics.
It's look very very basics, i thought to get something more informative..
Overall I think this is a great course and really helpful.
Although my code validated before I submitted it , I got it wrong on the quiz three times and it never did go through correctly!!.
Should update to Angular 2, or at least revise some exercises to include code for Angular 1.6.. and keep track properly of when gulpfile should be updated!
The course gives you interesting analysis tools, but the title suggests you are going to learn new Excel tools, and you actually use it at a very low level.
I struggled with the course itself, however.
This course was mostly working on the same document, and refining it for six weeks.
The basics are touched upon but I don't feel confident enough to start JavaScript coding on my own yet.
This would be a 5 stars course if it wasn't for the final project.
Homework was much more complicated than the information given.
Well presented, but this course should be optional in in the specialization.
this course is a decent introduction and overview from a sociological perspective, of the city.
I would add more examples on how to populate the data, even spend time on optional videos where the professor or his assistant goes through testing ratios (something similar to Operations Analytics).
I love the professors, but unfortunately, I do not feel much connection to me (not really seeing so much importance for me to identifying if a company is making fake financial statements; I am not an investor, and my everyday work does not really have so much to do with financial statements).
The Managerial Accounting (week 4) transforms my mindset!!
But in general, this course has the area for improvement.
The course is a lot about talking and theory which is not very interesting.
There's a lot of great information to pick up on, but some retooling from the UVA Darden School of Business would be greatly appreciated improvement.
Thank you for the opportunity though, I did enjoy it!
However few modules especially the later part of probability do not explain the concepts thoroughly.
a tad simplistic - grades should be locked too
I would not recommend if you do not have much confidence in your programming 'experience'.
Having said that, teaching team is great - very knowledgeable and supportive.
This course really need examples in final assignment
When mentioned other narratives are quickly downplayed or denied, and repeatedly dichotomies like the "inferior" arabs, the "ferocity" of the arab oposition and so on are mentioned or cited without beeing problematized at all.
an online editor is not good
The heavy use of technical jargon makes the concepts (which are intended to be simple) over complicated.
But only a part of it met my interests.
The certificate is worthless in my opinion.
It wood be interesting, but unfortunatly Prof. Vallverdú's English is quite hard to understand.
Really good level of detail versus other courses and difficult questions which really test your understanding of the subject matter.
On the downside, some links were not added to supplementary reading, which is a shame as these resources really help with your understanding
If so, this really doesn't reflect well on UCI as a teaching institution!
The course was very well organized, but the main topics of the course were still covered.
They confused me sometimes.
All the worth is in the summary back of each unit, you even need not to have the course.
Helpful, but the teacher is annoying and condesending.
Very highlever, i would have enjoyed more technique to understand art
Unfortunately, in my opinion this course is not intended for real beginners.
The first couple of weeks were awesome - love Scala the language and the whole functional approach, and the detailed description of how the language actually fits together.
Also love how the homework teaches you how to setup IDE, create unit tests, and submit actual code as homework - not just workbooks and multiple-choice quizzes like in some other courses.
But why oh why was it necessary to go in specific detail over how to define natural numbers from first principles using classes, or spend a whole week on lists, etc?
Frankly, issuing a certificate doesn't seem a lot of work.
not comprehensive enough
The course is not bad, but the information of the slides doesn't gives you much information to solve the questions.
Sometimes, the learner can find it hard to understand some topics (ex: stability and materials) because it is inadequately explained.
I believe many of students are taking this course to improve their career performance.
The forums were not monitored frequently, and when I got responses they were late as by that time I figured my issues or some of the suggestions offered were cryptic not giving me any hints or letting me know if my approach was in the right direction.
Either way, this course is very hard to do while also working on a full time job and travelling.
Well structured and informative.
I think it should focus on a more practice oriented course in order to master the price optimization process and see how it fluctuates in real life examples.
However, this course gives great insights and useful concepts that are of huge importance to the application of the revenue management activities.
this course was not unto the standard i even completed all the assignment i did not pass one and still i got time to redo the assignment and submitted and never got the grade back for it..
Separate documents for each question !!
Great
The course is nice and informative.
The videos unfortunately don't teach us much either.
This was a good course, but a bit elementary.
good introduction to smartphone
This is good because if what the activity desn't really apply to your situation it makes good practice to imagine a situation - not soo imaginative the task is incredibly easy - and apply what you've learned.
The course did not give specific tools to conflict resolution rather information about the subject was disseminated
Some pretty interesting start based on mathematics, but too lengthy obvious advice for someone who gets the concept right away.
I'm currently working as a software engineer on data science problems alone on my team.
Very limited information on Wordpress.
Basic progamimg understanding / interacting with Arduino
So you'll have to stop the video and look up the topic online.
Also lecturers were virtually nonexistent on the forums to help with questions which is disappointing since it is a paid course which implies you are paying for their time and effort not just the certificate.
Best advice for people taking this course is to get through the material as early as possible and give yourself as much time as possible to work on the project, don't wait till the last week to work on it.
Would also suggest the following changes to improve the course and help people understand the material better:1.
There are much simpler ways to introduce dynamic programming.
I recommend a few studies of astronomy before take it.
There are some issues with the feedback of others proffesors
Not for those with no background in advanced engineering math.
It is definitely now a 4-week class, maybe a a 2-week one if you take very easy.
need to explain things more.
Concepts weren't explained properly.
It's a challenging subject, but presented acceptably here.
The instruction is vague and boring.
Students may find that chunks of courses are devoted to a professor's research interests, which could enrich or derail the course.
I am probably more knowledgeable than most however.
Siemens is still involved in lawsuits about this and is on the news now.
Please also talk about IBM's involvement in helping Nazi's with punch cards to help organise the millions of jews and other races they murderedArt theft is something thats really interesting that was not touched upon.
When the course started it was very interesting.
On the other hand, Week 4 focusing on how to pass a test in my opinion jumbled the previous material up - passing a test doesn't mean knowledge, it means ability to pass a test.
Too much time is dedicated to the very basics.
Great, but I wish it was more detailed.
It would be better if it was more interactive.
Nice high level overview of the motion of robots.
Good candidates would have been software companies in the SaaS space.
It would be better to focus on a few key ones and then walk through the examples a little more slowly.
light-weight explanations.
Better animations and videos could enhanced the learning process.
questions are too easy.
Needs more complex tasks to integrates the different sections together.
I would be happy to chat with him about the realities of clicker training and how an event marker works, if he'd be interested ;)Futhermore, I bought the book and paid for a certificate, but because I took over 180 days to complete the course (despite the course being "self-paced, with suggested deadlines to help you keep on track), I did not get my certificate and was informed that to get it I'd have to pay again for the same product.
The professor is a bit monotone, he needs to be more animated.
Lots of video errors, and sometimes the lecturer's speech isn't very smooth.
I rated this as a 3 though I got a lot more out of the concepts and the class in the way it was taught than I had when reading books and literature on the subject.
If you know anything about management, specifically software engineering management, this course won't tell you anything new.
However, I feel that the lack of input from CALARTS is the drawback.
The assignment instructions weren't clear and when uploading the assignment files, the pages didn't render properly.
The videos are great.
Since randomizing the answers is so obvious and easy, I am really at a loss why the quizzes would be presented in this way.
The lectures are too short and not informative enough to complete the assignments.
or other things of that nature, would have definitely cut down on the length of the videos.
I took a guess and completed the assignment, but it would be helpful to understand the strategy for using social mention successfully.
Secondly, the IBM Blue Mix section did not work.
Decent Course for someone not much exposed to Excel.
maybe for the next upcoming series.
This course competes with a full specialization on Coursera with a slight flavor of the "Understanding Video Game" course also available on Coursera.
The grading is supported by quizzes and assignment associated to a poor grading system.
Expect the students should take the full specialization to advance the skills and knowledge to take the knowledge into a practical level.
very good as intro
PWM Switch modelling and use of that to simplify converter modelling not covered in detail.
More theoretical.
The quizzes dont really match the material covered and some of the questions are too ambiguous.
But, to those of us whom love science and specially 'Brain mysteries' this course is a different perspective from those physiological or pathophysiological brain courses.
It was good but so introductoryInstructors just reading the documents
Also, the course would benefit from better programming exercises... as it stands it is just "download a program, complete a couple of methods, fill in the gaps on a quiz"
The videos are quite cursory- almost an afterthought.
I am no beginner but I finished the whole thing in less than an hour.... Not much learned
But if you want to know much more about Html you should take Class on Fullstack Web Development by The Hong Kong university of Science and Technology which I liked more than this.
it's too much basic stuffs.
Would have been better if quiz access is available for free so that it is easier to reinforce concepts learnt.
The course is good for getting an overall idea of the main topics of finance but not on getting a deep understanding on them
I had a problem installing 'doorkeeper-mongodb' and it does not seem that this problem for a number of users.
I passed all the assignments but don't think I've mastered material here as much as in the previous courses of the specialization.
It seems to me that material could be broken up into two courses, and because it's squeezed in one, the instructors have to provide 99% of the assignment and finishing the rest 1% is not helping in learning.
Could also incorporate mental illness and disability aspects.
The tone of the course wasn't always to my liking (with the cartoons, animations, etc.)
Too little information and too basic.
This course could have delved in more depth in the respective subject.
The difficulty of assignments should be increased.
Of course it is still actual, but still - the newest text are from 2014, so newer examples would be great.
This learning was not supposed to be in it.
I know I can download the video transcript, but what I'd like is actual handouts that are organized.
Just my opinion.
Great course, but sometime it is boring since the introductor just read materials.
I liked that the lectures were well organized and the review questions in between the topics of discussion.
Still, the lectures were quite entertaining and the approach taken remarkable didactic.
I know there are a ton of differeint fMRI processing pipelines, but even just to walk through one would be much more useful.
It was completely literal, and often translated in ways that did not make sense.
A week, and partially the last week, are dedicated to the construction of a restaturant site.
Cracking the creativity code is an interesting topic.
I think these courses need to be condensed into a single one as the contents are rather limited individually.
Please review so that learners won't be too stress out..
Thanks for your kind attention.
It would have been better if some more concepts and case studies had been incorporated.
Some content is not prevalent at present (outdated).
However, I wish there would be a more detailed treatment of the topics in question.
A 2-hour assignment took me more than 3 hours to complete.
Technical questions aren't answered for days if at all.
I expected some more coding in the capstone rather than just apply code that has already been written
I now have a different perspective in life.
An advanced course , which also requires scores is needed.
Despite being a very interesting topic, I did not find this course as enjoyable as others I have done.
However the course needs to show more of the 'connection between steps' when stating a theorem for convergence tests.
This current version of calculus is a bit disappointing, earlier the practice problems were solved in steps.
For someone who's been a senior software engineer for a bunch of years, the topics on design patterns and tactics could have dug a bit deeper.
The reason for not getting 100% was because I was so annoyed with one of the quizes that I didn't bother taking it again to correct it.
The teacher is great at performing but the pace of the class is way too fast for me.
The assignment is hard.
But, hey, that's Berklee.
Great subject and some very well presented videos.
It's completely lack of mathematical background and the programming exercises are sometimes no more than copy paste.
I liked it a lot but I didn't´t find helpful the assignments and how they were asked to be corrected.
The class was good.
It takes a lot of outside work to get a good mark.
It's an introductory course so not deep, but fun.
A couple of things significantly detracted from the course for me.
One was a feeling of unqualified evangelism.
The Teacher was great, but I was behind a month just because nobody will grade assigment on week2.
One can get started with Programming with R w/o missing too much.
I was looking for something that wasn't an introductory course, but I took it thinking the peer reviews would be worth it.
First of all, the instructor is very responsible, keep updating information on the forum and course material.
The course content itself was good, however the final assignment was vague and confusing.
Summaries and connections between the different content parts are provided regularly.
The Quizz would need some profound revision since some links are not available anymore and some answer are simply wrong.
I believe this may be a more helpful course to those already quite familiar with statistics and for those who use statistical terminology daily.
For instance, my target market is comprised of sales and marketing managers in corporate and creative environments.
I liked the professor very much, and the expert interviews were interesting.
I felt overwhelmed by too much information all of a sudden in each lesson.
BUT....
I learned things that actually stuck.
It has videos of good quality, short examples and talks.
I understand that it must be a great challenge trying to teach R in four weeks.
-- the desire to create a format suitable for people with a scarce algebra preparation lead to use not the appropriate terminology, which would be more correct and easier to understand.
Not enough repetition in the way of homework.
); when pre-requisite courses are really necessary and when they're just recommended; dropping courses; GRADES (how the college grading system works, what happens when you fail a course, academic probation, earning honors); campus codes of conduct (greater freedom as with class attendance; smoking and drinking rules, harassment policies) and disciplinary actions (disciplinary probation, expulsion); good campus activities for shy students.
Interesting but not much of the science behind it was included, personal choice, but I prefer more why with my what.
The content just isn't explained well in the videos.
But 40 hours for one problem is crazy.
This course provides a lot of methods and strategies about reading data, manipulating data.
Great Course, but much too fast paced
Also, when trying to describe a 3D environment only moving hands, its quite impossible to determine what and where the instructor is.
You are basically fed with all their beliefs.
However, there's a lot of talk in chinese, due to questions/answers from teacher and students, and the quizzes are a bit too easy.
Poor structuring of assignments.
I had to search other resources to clarify the topics.
I am disappointed in the recent push to monetize courses.
I feel maybe it could have been organized better to make it more interesting Also reading some of Haldey wickhams book he deliberately keeps this part of Data Science away from new learners as it can be a bit dreary, so my recommendation would be to do some of the other courses first.
A very enlightening course ... i would have liked to hear more about the mythology and the gods roles
Nice course, though much of the content is relatively basic and only qualitative (for a professional, might be good for a new student).
very difficult with lots of math not properly explained.
Doesn't require the time that was allotted to it.
The professor does not evaluate your assignments.
Decent introduction course.
Without the rest it is useless in my opinion.
So only take in case you want to follow the entire learning path.
Luckily I had a better background but still had trouble going from lecture to exams.
But if you are new to the models, you may not really understand them.
In lectures on some concepts (like regularization) I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before..
A good course for the beginners.
My primary complaints are that I felt that the class moved too quickly and relied too heavily on students to teach themselves through the Pandas documentation.
Overall, there is some good info in it if you have no background in accounting and no idea what a balance sheet is, but if you're looking for insight into interpreting balance sheets, this is not the class for you.
Good insight into marketing analysis and the use of R
I liked this course, but there were a couple of advanced topics (Core Data, WatchOS/TvOS) that I wish we could have more time to spend on.
I hope that you will add more information.
Explanations and examples are not so good.
It would be helpful if there was some explanation why an answer your selected was wrong, a hint or something.
I wish a more extensive exam was administered.
It was short and interesting... and that is good.
But it has covered basics only .
I found the lectures marginally useful.
It was okay.
Nice overview of the specialization.
It seems that the basic rationale is being 'fired' in a not so much 'educative fashion'.
This is a great course for new parents who have no background on child nutrition.
It was also a little disappointing that the 4th lesson was extra long in terms of lectures and had no related assignments.
Finally, the next day after the course ends I am not able to view my assignments and the grade for the last assignment, even though the authors sent an email that it would be possible.
Good information, but the material is a little dry (the subsequent courses in the specialization are much more fun) - it's hard to make the introduction exciting, but adding some interactivity would be helpful.
Hovewer, I think, a course about music should include a little bit music :) It will be better to figure out the problem about copyright.
Very informative.
The way of presenting topics of philosophy is refreshing and inviting for further reflection.
I would prefer more details about how stuff actually work - in simple layman's terms.
Looking forward to the second course.
No moderators or teaching assistants answer questions in the discussion forum.
I would like to see the course get into more depth, for example where to start on market research.
It's so much subjective that it's making it awful.
Now about the good parts:Professor did a great job, the course inspired so many ideas for me.
The material is concise and it was a pleasure listening to this course.
Most of the courses are too slow for me, so I have to fast forward them to 1.5 and some even to 2 times speed.
For instance, on some occasions, the concept of independent events is used, but then, later on, the discussion talks of independent processes.
The title ' Beginner Specialization.
Excellent lecturers and high-quality material to study, although the course is heavily centered on human History as opposed to Big History - i.
e.
I was searching for more information about FHIR but it was great anyway.
It only gives you a basic overview of start up's vocabulary.
Some interesting points made but most of the information given was from other's research.
A little less self-promotion and a little more work, combined with less boring presentation would move it up to 4*
It took me about a week, but if I'd had the time I could have done it all in a day.
If its not present, the course should be entitled "Laboratory methods for antimicrobial resistance"
I think the course should add a video to explain more in details some concept as variables.
I know I am not explaining myself well; I simply mean that to learn a language in which the alphabet is different and the meanings are based on emphasis rather than actual words, requires, I think, perhaps a bit more anchoring for the complete novice.
Mediocre, not that helpful.
It's a good introductory course, but it's very basic and I feel that I paid a lot for a very basic experience.
Pavel
I had to take extra courses in other place in order to pass.
it is a little hard to student who not major in medicine
Her English is not so good, although she has a good know-how about the subject but the classes are completely boring and apathetic.
An interesting overview, but I wish it had been a bit more rigorous.
I have done some courses from other universities, which are more interactive and fun.
I would now be happy to use Spark in my work and feel I have a strong base to go on to further study.
It does not let it show as completed unless you purchase the course and take the quizzes.
The course was too expensive for the small content it provided
Far less staid than some of the more traditional academic teaching formats in this science field.
Bad arrangement!
From reviewing other's assignments, it did not appear to be just me.
gave us many skills to save our time
It's quite a simple course.
The discussion boards are helpful.
Good course, but I think the previous courses of the specialization are better organized and structured than this one.
Needs improvement a lot I think.
scarce material for weekly study
You need some background on the reproductive system in order to fully understand it.
The knowledge needed to answer the quizzes and achieve the desired results in the assignments are vastly different and should be addressed.
The case studies at the end are insightful and more use could be made of them in a more advanced course.
I note that also the course Critical Perspectives on Management had the same problems with the quizzes and also did not provide slides.
www.
GIROIDEA.
it – I believe in continuing education.
This course is too broad and specific to USA.
Good cource.
I'm quite sure you need a quite strong background in maths to be able to really understand this course, it should have more math lessons, or readings about it.
However, some cases studies should be updated.
I liked that the course was very assignment-oriented.
Interesting tips and summaries.
The practice programs contained lot of code which was confusing for a learner like me.
Course contents are very short and to the point.
A great course and fully packed with interesting information about different methodologies thought time.
This course was pretty okay, I'd say.
Very short.
They re-sent it several times but it never came through.
writing documentation and not thinking on creating game...).
As a consequence, I am now not sure if I want to do the capstone......
Otherwise the course by itself is great.
Starting place to begin in continuing your horizons
Learning R is very interesting and applicable.
the course is very good.
I had difficultly with the two assignments, not because they were difficult but because the instructions were not clear.
The professor, Michael Scharf, seems to have a heavy bias to "justice" (as in punishment) and that leaves me with a poor taste as I listen to his content.
No big deal.
The conceptual parti seems a little bit too important.
Quite good in average.
Speak too fast and lack of interaction in the first 3 modules.
The course was good.
This course has amazing information in the lectures, but it is difficult in the video lectures to pick out what bits of information are going to be relevant in the quizzes, you will have to re-take quizzes a number of times, no matter how well you are taking notes.
Some very good explanations, especially by Michel Girardin.
(My heart sank when I saw I had to reuse my week 2 work in week 4 as I knew how much messing around I had done to get that one through the grader - I knew it would give problems)As there were a couple of mistakes in the course (for example if you follow the steps in assignment 3 correctly then the final rspec would give failures - obviously this wasn't picked up by lecturers) it creates confusion and doubt as to whether you have made the mistake or the tutors.
The course content is good but the assignments need to be shorter and more forgiving of mistakes (i.
e make the individual tasks independent of one another and pass if you get 80%).
Moreover, the questions are iterative and thus the same apparent error carries on and you get multiple wrong scores.
Assignments need to be submitted in documents.
Wouldn't recommend following *all* the advice (e.
g.
For the most part, the assignments were good.
Components required for the final assessment are introduced in part 3 of the specialization, which is to say a little late.
There were numerous misspoken or confused terms that could easily have been re-recorded or edited.
The teacher seems to mainly read the slides and the tone is quite scholastic, not a lot or engagement.
Very common RF knowledge and less deeper knowledge than expected.
The course is different from expected.
However, the course could use better the Coursera format and strenght.
The certified certificate is pricy compared to other courses.
In overall it’s good.
This meant that grasping concepts and learning from the questions came in a distant second priority to debugging.
Dr Koller mentioned that the material is aimed at postgraduates.
Sometimes is hard to follow
The course does not make you learn spreadsheets in detail.
I still felt like some exam questions relied on material not yet lectured, which would sometimes leave me at a loss as to how I should have gotten to the right question in the first place.
Worth the time though!
The course was interesting but I think Coursera is not quite what it used to be.
Think you should ask him to tone it down big time... Everything in small doses is great.
I think there is an unfair marking system in the last week - I wrote about it too.
From class one I struggled trying to understand what was going on.
I found plenty of useful information in this course overall but lectures often spent too much time dwelling on the detail of simpler concepts while more complex areas, and sometimes critical information that was later built upon, were only touched briefly or sometimes skipped entirely.
The assignments are also badly designed.
This is true at some colleges, but at others, the amount and quality of research can determine whether a professor gets to continue working there and reach tenure.
An okay introduction to the specialization; hopefully, the future courses will get into more detail.
But with no direct access to the instructor, interactions come from discussion forums and peer reviewed assignments.
it's hard to understand
Overall an excellent course and specialization.
Each of these lessons about the legal debates outlines and develops the opposing sides but doesn't give you a whole lot of new content to be tested.
The types of documents assigned were either not covered or barely covered in the course leaving the students to guess what was expected.
For exemple, in talking about selection procedures, the only tool discussed more deeply is interview.
Worth skimming fast through for free to learn a little something about the brain.
Some interesting parts but quality of visuals poor and presentation suffered
As with a few coursera courses there seems to be an assumption that students know the material being discussed and so it isn't explained.
I never heard of this topic before and the lecturer ommited many steps when explaining the Edit Distance.
Distracted, useless info and short (finished in 3 Hours)
The lectures have basically no training or necessary teachings for the math needed for the quizzes.
The course content was slightly repetitive and the information on the Myers-Briggs personality types can be found online.
May be my english is too bad, but i found this course too difficult to understand, especially pick all the right answers in a list.
But there are some things I disliked and I guess by fixing them the course would become much much better.1.
Graphs / Videos / Pictures.
I really did, even if it may not sound like it :)
Course progresses monotonously.
Anyway, it is a good course!
I believe the assignments given from this class are realistic to real-world situations.
Information is to abstract, the teacher tells some obvious things.
I recommend this course to all all.
As usual, the presentation from Brian Caffo is rather rushed and stumbling.
I felt that topics were not treated in enough depth.
This is all information I already have in my arsenal after researching health trends and learning more about how I should eat.
The final test (week 5) had a few questions which weren't covered in the lesson.
But I expected more.
A nice short course.
If not, go buy a good book.
I find proofs necessary for a good understanding of concepts.
Also, it seems good for listening to twitter, for example, but not other social medias that could be much more interesting in different situations.
At some time, Prof. Sachs points out a few numeric indicators that favor economic development, but when talking about reaching these numbers, he offers more than debatable ways.
clear and good example but limited contents
more of an ad for all of these software companies rather than being taught anything.
Also the companies discussed during the course should not be more known global companies (like Redhook, or the food market examples), hence not to restrict it to USA.
The course could and should have digs a hole lot deeper into the material, a brief history of the web, the browser, wars standards compliance, I feel, should have been part of this course.
Maybe people found the course very useful however I felt like there was too much text and immediate switch to Excel file that was elaborated shortly.
There isn't any community or TA help to speak off.
The course gives an general theoretical overview about nutrition, but not goes further into details or practical example.
Do not like essay questions.
Also please do not use hardcoded subtitles in the video, because there already is a option to enable subtitles.
Like in some assignments the text is wrong, for the Account code example, you never really mention the mOut or the interface the class uses which are in the example files and what to do with them when you write the other constructors (The course goes over this later when talking about the constructors and calling a constructor from another constructor but not that early on when you're working with the Account example files5.
Concepts take into account the latest & greatest of HTML & JS.
Lots of random details that the professor seems to have missed make the course difficult because you end up spending hours debugging random, irrelevant things.
At the end Prof. Green strongly invites us to enroll for a degree in his field at the university of Maryland and there wouldn't be any problem with that without the kind of messy feeling that the course leaves you with.
I LIKE THAT THERE IS INTERACTION BETWEEN PEERS AND HOW THERE IS FEED BACK FROM EACH OTHER, BUT I DONT LIKE THAT IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN OPINION, IT DOESNT SEEM TO BE ENOUGH, IF I GET FEEDBACK FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS AS LITTLE AS ME OR IS BEGINNING TO EXPLORE GRAPHIC DESIGN, I WOULD HAVE LIKED AN OPINION FROM A PROFESIONAL OR A TEACHER WITH MORE EXPERIENCE.
I feel like I got just as much imagemaking experience from the intro to graphic design course offered by Cal Arts.
I did like that the final exercise required a fair amount of investigation into understanding the documentation and relationship between the files before undertaking to code.
A little bit too conceptual and very basic.
I really enjoyed the presenter who was engaging and interesting.
Also although most of the tests were easy to complete, the ones that you had to write the answer down instead of only choosing the correct answer, were hard since if one word you wrote was wrong you lost the question.
Excellent overview of plotting and clustering.
It was more like a high school kid reading the slides.
I missed more mathematical foundation.
The course is effectively a tutorial on how to use proprietary software to solve a range of machine learning problems.
I liked the fact that the course covered a wide range of problems quickly.
good course a bit hard to understand at times the information can get confusing but the it is there wish they would add printable bulletins at the end so make information readable just for extra help with the understanding of the material
I'm going to continue studying the course.
It was very dificul, i think yoou need to improve the example you give the the students and be more interactive
It was too much information in a very short time.
The course is good for elementary understanding, th exercises were fun too.
would love to see a specialization in this topic with more hours and content covered.
I successfully passed the course, but I didn't really learn anything.
I'm giving 3 stars only because I was looking for something more about techniques..
Quite basic, but good to set the needed programs
The course was very good overall but I would have often preferred for the lectures to be more on point.
There were multiple occasions where I wanted feedback on not just the technical correctness of my solution but also to know if there might have been a more idiomatic or generally efficient (read: tail-recursive) way to express some peculiar bit of logic.
My brain had to take extra cognitive workload to decipher what was actually said before trying to understand the materials on the slides and everything else.
I might always be.
I hope you can help in this matter as there does not seem to be anywhere on your site where one has the opportunity to contact Coursera with problems such as this as I do not think this review page is truly relevant to the problem but where else can I go?
For one assignment the provided template left off a section required in the grading criteria.
This could have been a the best MOOC on Coursera but the professor's explanation is simply not upto the mark.
It's arguable that this is one way of learning and more of realistic.
Those programs were written by the instructor and presented quickly as examples, but some of the content in the programs was not already known or presently explained, like the "buffer" built-in function (found in Chapter 3 of Dr. Chuck's book but not covered in the course) and the "pass" keyword, which I had to find in the Python reference manual for an explanation.
These are the columns starting with “t02”, “t04”, “t06”, “t07”, “t08”, “t09”, “t10”, “t12”, “t13”, “t14”, “t15”, “t16” and “t18” BUT EXCLUDING those which are not part of the previous groups only.
It is overall an ok course.
(( I think I`ll disenroll
But anyway, quick dive into swift.
The main concern , however is the sudden death approach that is used to evaluate the performance on the final examination.
Probably good for someone who has never done programming before.
I never knew that what I learned in high school in the past can actually be used to come up with models to solve business problems.
I believe the two first modules (html, css) are way too basic to really learn anything.
The questions to the quiz are very easy to answer to.
But on the contrary, as I'm paying to get the knowledge I shouldn't be wandering around to understand something that should've been taught in the lectures.
Moreover, I think that the videos need to be updated, the mentors need to be more involved in the forums, and the way the slides are presented within the videos should be more interactive or dynamic rather than being just captured lines of codes.
While I understand that this is where she would feel the most comfortable and familiar, to start with her broaden-and-build theory and continually reference her lab's work, with the additional readings often being her books, it felt limited.
It is quite general, I liked the examples, although there could be more varied examples from many other dissimilar disciplines.
Is there any robust methods to build controls automatically?
Other courses have along assignments but they are much better designed.
It was very theorical than pratical
I didn't like the fact that the course spent a lot of time covering legal topics.
And I cannot get any help from here.
There were references to non-existing weeks, and to subjects that were not part of this course.
Many things are not clear enough in multivariable regression part.
The first week gave me a good insight into the data science process.
I appreciate the effort that went into making this course as well as obtaining the film clips.
The quizzes are very basic though and appear to be there only to check if the student has gone through the lectures.
I don't really see the value in those software, and it felt very sales pitch-y.
hope to add more nutrition knowledge.
However, the final autograder quiz was extremely temperamental and gave no usable feedback.
I did the first one, but I didn't feel like I learned from it and peer feedback was very slow.
It seemed like course material had little to do with the assignments.
As much as I enjoyed completing this course, as I've enjoyed every course in this program, this one feels less organised than the others simply in that the learning material doesn't clearly connect with the writing material and it was difficult to predict what the review criteria might be.
The topic is very interesting and the instructor is sharing some interesting data, however I found the way she talks too exaggerated, and the end it sounds like lot of empty phrases, not giving me anything I could put into practice.
The instructor is at time incomprehensible.
The course laid out the concepts pretty well but if one had access to the materials, the lectures were not really necessary to understand the concepts.
This was because the lectures were pretty much a re-reading of the materials and more importance could be placed on creating scenarios where the processes would be applicable.
The quizzes were super easy, I dropped out at final project, I couldn't get through the first questions.
Unfortunately this does not provide enough possibilities/assignments to deeply relate to the language and really feel comfortable in it (not even at the beginners level as is the aim of the course).
It is very basic and boring.
Too few questions, testing some questionable knowledge (eg, what other courses there are in the specialisation -- hardly a required tool in the data scientist's box).
Overall, it's a good preparation for what is to come.
Considering the contents of the second and third course, this was too basic.
For an undergraduate course it's good - my only comment is on delivery - quotations given verbally might have been better if shown on screen to drive them home.
I hope the professor will do a military history course that analyzes war more particularly now that we have the broad strokes.
Had value.
Besides, some of the videos are missing and some quiz are not well clarified.
It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created (even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been).
The only reason I give 3 stars is because there were no pdf documents of the lectures.
Not groundbreaking content or presentation compared to courses featuring Steve Blank or leaders from Google.
Hint to the authors: use Python, R or Octave like everyone does.
Some of the questionaries are ambiguous.
There is a lot of value to taking the course.
The info presented in this course is rather superficial.
Insufficient available project available for review and thus unable to pass course due to technicality.
This is not nearly enough a balanced output of resources to allow students to grasp the concepts.
I learned a lot.
This course is very theory heavy.
For an introductory course it is ok, however can't help get the feeling that the material is just skimmed through.
Well constructed and easy to follow, but lacks mathematical derivation.
The content of the course is good and I feel it would be beneficial for beginners or those who want to top up their technical / academic knowledge on the subject.
I found the terrible editing of the lectures distracting though, and it felt like no one bothered to over-see the final version that was published.
This course is the worst i have taken on coursera.
It woud be a great course if it were a little more accessible.
Various helpful techniques but I did find the course rather boring, especially the multiple-choice questions and all the "scientific" facts about the brain.
Covers fundamentals very well, and the textbook is excellent.
Some of the slides are hard to read - the white text on fluorescent green particularly!
the assignments stick with the lab exercise.
I had to downgrade from rails 4 to 3 and then to 5, etc hitting StackOverflow every time to sort out technical issues.
Not very "Executive level" as the course title and description imply.
But assignments could improve:-All module assignments seems mostly focalize on using Microstrategy tool.
very minimal presentation of many concepts!
Very theoretical and somewhat dry.
The last module I found the most interesting as it covers challenges to child rights in real time cultural/social dilemmas.
The course seems like it would benefit parents but does not do much for a nutrition health professional.
Peter Navarro and really appreciate his teaching, but I don't think mixing too much personal bias into the public course is responsible and objective, and that's why I took two stars off.
One point of frustration however was the near total unavailability of the course TA's or instructor.
Very basic, but some things are useful, the course is worth it if you are a total newbie
Slow review process (can be).
A lot of mistakes.
Nice for those that want to understand some concepts of IoT
Filmed in interesting locations relating to subjects.
Good content for Data Scientists but video lessons are not sufficient to be able to complete the assignments.
the course is relatively short for providing sufficient technology and knowledge to master a new project.
I would appreciate a bit less overacting and goofiness (which actually praised in the course) and have a bit more academic material.
As a teacher, I am disappointed at the rubric that is given because students are grading each other and may not know what an "average" response is I feel that the rubric should be better structured to help give a more objective grade.
The quizzes were very detailed and specific - which I do not disagree with - but I feel as though they sometimes focused on minutiae rather than large or critical concepts.
There were also several spelling and grammar mistakes throughout the quizzes.
Sometime the professor gives us a good lecture with lots of interesting details, sometimes he's just rambling.
I had a hard time finding material to study.
I wish the class had more reading material.
There arent enough examples to get us a good path to learning Python.
This is a really excellent course.
The composition and visual elements part of the course was incredible but the Lightroom part could be improved.
Barb's (the instructor's) personal background particularly resonated with me: she is someone who entered Engineering, a very demanding field, without much science background, and had to adapt to many new and challenging ideas.
Just a basic introduction to computer science.
The assignment is not engaging.
The material is good, but I've found the lectures challenging to understand even having some background in math.
They do not need this course, though.
Nice but lacking.
Longer than expected.
Material is very detailed which is both a positive and negative.
The course should have more programming assignments than just having simple quizzes.
The voice is not good!
too easy and pretty long for me
Should be amplified with additional weeks of topics, e.
g.
Introductory Level Course.
Nothing much on analytical methods.
I am not able to practice optimization methods implementation (Like - fmincg etc).
Video lectures are good but at some places lack the explanation (Like how do we get the cost function of neuralnets).
While the lectures were good, this course had annoying issues, such as in-video questions asking us to refer to previously shown material (which isn't easy given the Coursera interface).
He will actually explain Pandas.
inclination was more towards concept than excel
good , but elementary ( undergrad level)
But we just student, our work are rough, not amasing.
I like these courses allot.
detailed introduction but I feel sometimes the topic can be a little bit deeper.
The first course is the one attract me of this specialization, the second one, somehow, is a bit disappointing, especially compared with plotting skill of R in another data science specialization, which is even an elementary level course.
In assignments, i would like to see more exercises so that students learn through practice of business cases.
When I posted week two work an old website I'd built populated.
Although the text book was an excellent tool.
Top free course about Data Science.
A good basic introduction to Organization Design.
Very interesting but too many informations on a short course
I had me thinking and discussing what I learned.
So many valuable information in this course.
But professor can surely present it in better way.
If you have had some experience and would like to try Spark or get better at it, then probably a good book can save your time.
This was a very necessary but boring class.
Do find it is a bit too basic for people who are in the psychology field.
Good intro - I'm learning a lot.
!it was interesting.
Grading by students concept is not 100% accurate.
Exercises need to be reviewed and corrected as they contain many typos and inconsistencies in- not at PwC standard!
To conclude, it was a very enjoyable course that help grasp basic concepts of modern art.
I like the course, it is pretty good to learn screenplay, butThey need to explain a little some topics that new writers maybe don't understand.
Good course if you do not have any idea about Big Data and the technology used.
Some of the quiz questions were looking for details that I felt were not important for the learner.
too basic,you need read more online resources to do real projects.
I'm surprised to see an entire course on Software Product Management without a single mention of Lean principles.
I wish the quiz was not that detail oriented and hard..
That week 4 should be promoted more!
Just plenty of work to be done and small amount of that work is going to stay with you.
The course way OK, but it had some flaws.
It was very general and could have gone into more detail, but that was intentional, I guess.
Week 1 is doable.
But for beginners, it is hard to understand and catch interest on the topic if not discussed with detailed examples and not merely giving highlights on the examples.
Good basic information overview.
I understand why they did it that way, as they are used to reading music, but music can also be described as actual note names and the theory will be learnt nevertheless, without the massive barrier of having to translate it all from musical notation.
Short, simplistic.
The videos give some perspective at the time of taking care of our own health and eating habits.
The only problem I see, is the shortness of the course and the videos.
The positive is that is was very accessible in time and presentation however provides little insight to ins
The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html/css and fully dives into JavaScript.
I do not think that this course will make someone really spaek Chinee in China.
I believe that assignments that would require more involvement from the students (e.
g.
I really enjoyed the last part of the course related to the Gesture Interaction and the practical exercise on third week, but overall I missed much more modern materials to show us.
The course is very well structured, but the teacher is boring
Nevertheless thanks for the course.
That said, it does provide a great basic overview of the concept and the mathematical side is still useful, particularly if interested in the engineering aspect.
Overall however the content is good for a very basic introduction and
But it is up to the student to have the initiative to dig deeper into the material by going through the various API reference documentations in order to create the final data applications.
This was the maiden voyage and it has some problems that should probably be corrected.
In weekly quizzes the first answer was always the right answer.
Too simplistic.
He keeps repeating himself... Not much content in the latter half of the course
I feel course lacked depth, and didn't really answers main question: how to find business model, or gave case studies of business model.
The instructors (particularly David) are friendly and helpful - it's just that nothing is dealt with in any great depth.
learning graph with Java while reviewing varieties of java advanced data structure.
So So.
Not good to learn an algorithm
The key information is in the code!
However I learned the main techniques used in formulation, so no regrets.
It felt like it was more for informing families struggling with nutrition than for informative education on health and food.
The interview with Michael Pollan that was woven in to each lesson were the main reason to finish the course.
Read around the course and visit the data science specialisation wiki for extra information, and work through it at your own pace, rather than that suggested by the course.
I wish there several comprehensive examples of exploring some real data as guided by the course instructors.
Was expecting more hands on stuffs, the class is too conceptual.
A bit of repetition with module 1 of the Specialization.
There is missing swirl excercises and other hands on practical work.
Such quiz questions sometimes feel like those reading comprehension questions from a standardized test, rather than tests of the material covered in the lesson.
Too bad.
Not so comfortable with using Excel.
The syllabus is nice for three weeks course.
But you have missed many more important topics like forms etc.
please try to include them in future.
Anyways , teaching is good.
The course content was mostly great and clear, but on occasion it lacked proper elaboration and definition of subjects discussed.
Please stop watering down these courses!
The course covered the material thoroughly, but the presentation could be improved: 1. the examples, charts and other helpful aside additions could be left on screen during the relevant discussion.
It also wouldn't let me open the discussion forums.
Lacks of explanation on the javascript part.
in which I have no experience or knowledge.
Good for what it is: a rock-bottom basic introduction.
Expected a more rigorous course.
As far as actually building a team myself, I think this course won't really give you that if you don't already have other management experience, but it does give you some insight on the specifics of data science people.
I felt the content was a little too basic though.
I will try again, hopefully will get it this time.
With CSS and javascript later in the series, I felt a stronger (both in depth and coverage) HTML proficiency is needed.
I liked it, but I felt like they didn't get very in depth about a lot of the topics.
I think it better to teach more about methods.
The material in this course is very interesting.
This iteration is very "paint-by-numbers", much of the material, conclusions, format, is already prepared in advance.
very informative and interesting course.
I think MOOC course should be the same as a real college course.
I didn't find it too relevant or helpful in terms of making me more productive at work.
In some way, the iterative process of coming back to the idea, from document to document, helped to refine the game, but it happened more as something natural.
I wished we would have had some sort of checklist to evaluate and apply during the design process the framework.
As feedback to the instructor, I think he needs to stop using the ending word "right?"
If you have next to no financial literacy, however, this would be an invaluable course.
It's okay to throw that in every now and then but this was really awful, makes you want to forward to the parts where he is normal.
It cannot not provide sufficient concept and knowledge for student to complete it, especially who not familiar with pandas.
Dr. Harris teaches complex things in an easy manner.
Cons:-Assignments are not available for audit students.
The due dates are inconsistent through different pages.
Without discussion and the ability to interrupt and ask questions, the lectures are at times a more frustrating than useful (especially with Coursera's user interface, which lacks quick rewind and is generally speaking rather poorly thought out).
For many of the topics, better videos exist online (try safari or pluralsight).
But the spoken language is not that great and the steps are way to quick to do this in practice yourself.
There were several quizes were a single wrong answer resulted in having to take the quiz over.
very slow pacing but ok content
It is a course made in 2014
It's a very basic course to learn a very small things about bootstrap, jquery and HTML, but I think the level is too advanced for non-programming people, it should be better structured.
Videos with guest speakers were unhelpful.
Much of the material could have been presented without so much of Melissa's presence and waving hands.
To complete this course you have to go back and forth for the basic.
An engaging instructor, but I was hoping for something a little more in-depth, with more rounded guidance for personal brand development.
The forums were also not helpful, since there were not many taking the course.
At the end of all this, if I ask myself, did I learn a lot?
Course is awesome but the final 36 questions are really a headache.
I'm not going to recommend this course strongly.
The course is good, but it doesn't really offer all the tools required to pass the exams.
Probably useful if you already have extensive experience with other programming languages.
Good material and practical ideas for the day-to-day use at work.
By the way, some R programming concepts could be introduced here and de-clutter the congested/crammed R programming course.
The peer review is not a good idea for this course.
It was quick, but I was expecting some more views and videos of other professionals to get the additional learning.
Learning about metrics (week 4) is always useful, so five stars for weeks 3 and 4.
Too much synthetic on very important parts, too much focused on graphlab
Nice, but I expected more (or something else).
The course covers very limited subset of plots and mostly oriented to R-specific technical routines rather than overall approaches.
That said, if you have some programming knowledge to begin with, the Week 2 and Week 4 programming assignments were good.
Overall this class was a good starting point for basics of finance, but coming from an Ivy League school it could stand a bit more polish and professionalism, especially if Yale University expects people to pay for the class and their accreditation.
The instructor has an odd speech manner which takes a little bit of time to get used to, but doesn't detract from the material.
The tests are not difficult but the questions are often poorly phrased, such as questions that ask you what a certain term of art is while none of the answer choices are descriptions of the term of art and the correct answer is an application of the term that does not actually answer the call to question.
Most of the videos are cobbled together excerpts from lectures the professor previously gave.
All ideas presented were great, but I think it is just matter to clarify better the objectives in each week.
I suggest to introduce a balance in theory concepts and practical training.
Interesting, but content is a bit limited
I actually like all the detail, but I think it's covered too quickly and the course should probably be made longer to deal with it all.
I am not pursuing a career in this field therefore it didn't entirely appeal to me but Professor Boyd is very passionate and knowledgable at what he does!
It was little difficult to understand what the professor , but anyway it was good.
Still, worth some time if you want to learn more about where current trends are heading.
Compared to previous two courses in specialization this one is far worse - it is more of excursion into used methods than actual learning using any of mentioned methods in enough detail to be able to do meaningful analyses.
I would like to seen the slides for the presentations.
Some of the videos has low quality, which make them harder to understand for non native speakers.
I think that the course is good but the assignements are totally not at the same level of the explanations, except for the last assignement.
Overall I feel like I have a decent base in R, however I still feel like a lot of concepts were lost/not explained thoroughly enough.
Not a very good course.
It would be helpful if these issues are addressed.
Also, the use of articles is a common weakness for a lot of students (to "the" or not to "the").
The course may be called Pro Tools Basics but this requires also basic audio knowledge.
In particular in the 2nd set of exercises.
Good introduction to big data.
And all 3 are usually just implementations of some basic algos seen in lectures.
I consider the course valuable due to a number of good videos and a couple of good tasks to do.
I also wish the professor would simplify the language in which he speaks in the lectures.
I would have liked the course to have been more hands on.
Extremely annoying at 1.5x speed.
I could barely get the videos to work.
All of it based on a personal opinion.
In general, this is a good course for those who start thinking of doing research in the future
I had many issue with pro Tools first, be sure to get a full vertion and an iLok key from avid before enrolling, will save much stress and trouble.
For instance, It will be more interesting if we put in different setting of conversation.
It was the least focused course in the specialization, but still did provide insight in an area I probably knew the least about.
The site is not very user friendly.
I will definitely be going back to rewatch some of these lectures in the future.
The material and presentation are at the highest level, but the course is lacking real life examples, and contexts.
I wonder if I can learn anything from a course that contains such little content.
This was a good series for beginners.
I don't think the assessments were worth upgrading to the paid version of the course though.
This specialization is well worth it, for the videos alone.
Very good content, oo long, too many words to get to the point, and too many instructions on assignments.
Awesome, straight to the point and full of great new ideas, I just wish it was longer
WIsh there were more assignments.
Financial Markets provided good information on the landscape of finance, mostly referring to USA.
The way the assignments are written was sometimes confusing.
I think what the instructor can do is to summarize the important "take aways" at the end of each video lesson.
Just wish to have some concept check before taking the quiz.
I particularly like that insights are provided in terms of what aspects to consider when designing a recommender system; pros and cons of different approaches.
And I appreciated most of the videos, especially the shop talks.
But I wish the instructor or his staff were more present in the discussion area, and I would have preferred a better written material.
My advice to the staff is that Structure all the similar things and explain them at one place.
Unfortunately, "Strategy pillar" and "Ethics pillar" are observed in far less details than "Law pillar" here.
Thank you!
Finally, complete the assignments took way long that what it is suggested.
The course is a good overall approach to Human-Computer Interaction.
The course is quite demanding from the get go.
I’m not sure about hating, but it was annoying as hell.
For example deman and supply functions.
I would recommend this course for someone that at least have a basic Java or programming background.
It's a very basic course with little technical overview.
It seems that teachers had the assumption that students already had some previous knowledge of philosophy.
I really liked the intent and where she was going.
It was easy to follow and complete, although there was something missing for me.
I would have preferred more in depth discussion of the topics
I had some questions on the forum but not answered.
The ONLY reason I rated low is because I paid this course and am receiving NO feedback from other students on essays.
The information is good (what there is of it) and is presented well.
If certificates achieved through Coursera are known to be only peer reviewed, such certificates will not carry weight and be recognised by other organisations/employers.
And I expected it to be a bit more systematic – simple (and quite fragmented) examples around one case... Could be a bit more.
But I actually felt like in point one, even tho I was listening and understand what they were talking about, I didn`t felt related to any certain situation or example.
The course is super interesting.
His English is not very idiomatic but that's not really a big problem.
The professor spends LOTS of time doing really, really simple work -- over-explaining things, to be honest, in such a way that makes them more confusing.
Good one
On the other hand, some topics are addressed confusingly (e.
g.
Now, when we do the peer review we realize that you're expecting for us to rate the new introduction based on having "early prototype" and "user feedback".
The fact we get no feedback on incorrect answers is not very helpful.
This class had a lot of good material and it truly showed how powerful GIS is in analysis.
I thought there would be a bit more evidence based information as stated.
If you've not read a single book on writing, this class might be good.
----------- From the blog ----------------------------------I recently took the FREE Coursera course, "Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World".
There are a few mistakes here and there that create confusion.
Keep the good work.
Not what I was expecting, but for the ones who enjoy social networks and want to learn, I recommend.
Perhaps a second video lecture per week that delves into greater detail, so that the level of discussion is more in line with the PMBOK.
The course provides a number of very useful tips for researchers, especially those whose first language is not English.
However I will rate it in terms of the aesthetic, organization or structure of the slides .
The organization of the content of the slides needs to be properly organized.
It gave a good general picture of what project management is about.
There didnt seem to be any sense in why we were asked to write those.
Even then, it was a lot of mucking in the dark and assignments took longer to complete than they should have.
Several - roughly 50% - of the links for external contents, especially when they are from newspapers, are broken.
That considered, it was a fascinating journey.
I'd also like the course would more specifically envision a great variety of target audiences.
The beginnings are good!
The course seems to require a high level of foundation knowledge that I don't necessarily have
problems..
problems ongoing
To make this course worthwhile you have fast forward a lot through the sales raps, which includes a few lectures in their entirety.
This course needs a cleanup of loose ends on some of the assignments.
A very basic course.
I need access to the quizzes
pretty basic information with lots of repetition.
However, the lectures were too long.
It gave a few good advices about learning and introduced some noteworthy concepts, but the videos became quite boring and repetetive after a while.
Interesting insights by Professor Shiller, but the course is set at an overly beginners level
However, theres's still room for some improvement.
This course has a 5 star potential, so I hope the reviews are being read so they can work towards that goal!
Good general overview to rethink the steps of publishing plans for early stage researchers.
The course has helped me to improve these skills.
There's a lot of material and it's hard to grasp it all.
During the lectures there are some examples that in some cases are presented as very small images and briefly.
The lectures seem to be a collection of bullet points.
The assignments and the peer review structure is really a low point.
Thanks so much for a solid course that covers all the main pillars for understanding the structure and philosophy of the Union.
A week covers 2-3 chapters in the book.
In a digital world content is king - both in quality and quantity.
The only critic I have is that the instructions/grading rubric for the assignments are terribly vague.
Very much a straight lecture course of rather difficult material.
Very short overview, well explained but wish there was more depth.
Also, I found that the order for some lectures seemed off and the flow between instructors was not as seamless as it had been before.
While the topics are really interesting and Geoffrey is really knowledgeable, a lot of simple concepts have been made seemly complicated from the way they have been presented -- often requiring external follow up studies (and often discovering in surprise how simple they actually are).
I could not have finished the course if I hadn't had an SQL/data-base expert in the same office, who I could pose questions to.
I hope you find my comments useful.
The result is that my grade (A) does not reflect my comprehension of the material.
However, some of the JavaScript was glossed over and very difficult to follow.
In my opinion it should not be in the body of the course material.
I am finding a lot of good information in the course, and am continuing with the second section.
the course was too short.
That course is wonderful and interesting too.
***** rating couldn't be given in the absence of Certificate.
Very basic course for American non-healthy food consumers.
This would help if you wanted to rewatch a certain part but couldn't recall which video it was in.
If you don't pay the fee to get the certification, you can't do the assignments :(
Fast, efficient, not very time-consuming.
)There was also no option in these videos to thumb-up or -down vote, or to report a problem, like I had seen on other courses.
In my opinion the videos were well spoken and easy to understand, and they included everything one could think of when first considering to start playing the guitar.
As in previous specializations - in my opinion all of the module slides should be in the readings section in only one document, instead of divided in small pieces per video lecture.
I hope that yu accept my critic as constructive because I have liked most of Illinois courses and was very impressed by the quality and extensive set of videos in the Improving Business speciaization.
The content is quite clear the course is going good so far ; however, i recommend the lecturer be more lively to help other be more interested in the course
other than that it was very well structured and oraganized!
I like this programme its very helpful and encouraging for me to do programming
Gives a solid background though which, in my opinion, every aspiring data analyst needs.
It is introduced too late in the course, when homework needed it is all done with, and in my opinion there isn't enough pedagogic content on the subject.
Kind of a new experience for me.
This is further evidenced by the posts in the forums requesting guidance about certain items.
course is short and really can be completed in an evening or two.
Could be even more details and demanding in terms of content, overall it is a good introduction to the topic
Some of the information given was more about other species and I think that's what made it less gripping for me.
Assignments and assessments took at least 2 to 3 times as long as described.
Would be much better if it cited the studies that the professor refers to in the lectures.
The videos and assignments are the same, but some of them have been removed, so there are confusing discontinuities.
Would be much better to be required to do more work in the assignments (possibly step by step and by splitting the course).
a little bit disapoint with this course.
But I think lectures must be more detailed and related to assignments.
more excercises should be added to the course
The course gives a very high level overview of hardware security and does not go into particular details.
But better be more interesting with more ways of presenting and showing.
However it was mind bogglingly confusing about what was exactly required for the final assignment.
The course was very short and very basic.
It's not an intro class.
The in-video quizzes weren't up-to-the-mark as per me.
Its intresting but often feels repetitive and more like advertising.
I thought the presenters/teachers were great, and I liked their author interviews.
I would also suggest providing more challenging assignments, for instance, as optional ones.
Good basic course
Interesting but very introductory.
Would have liked an exercise between lessons.
Lower quality when compared to the previous courses in this specialization.
More like copy and paste.
(I do not watch people read prepared text in a video.
This is kinda the way things work when you inherit a bunch of code, but its not how it works if you have to write it from scratch.
This course has been taught many times, and the forums contained old posts, and they didn't seem as useful as in other courses I've taken.
My main objective for this course was to continue learning Java, and it helped me do that, so I gave it 3 Stars.
It was a good course where i learned about new and great tools and techniques.
The course is very interesting.
The organization of this course was very good.
The second time, with the longest time, I could better perform the exercise.
Would have liked clearer instructions for final assignment.
It needed to be longer to be worth it
Be ready to take some other course or reading parallel.
Not so engaging if using the non-paid options
A very good introductory course.
Nevertheless, I missed the lecurer, I'd really liked that the lectured didn't read the script but retold it in the camera, it would be more of a face to face communication.
Most of the questions in the peer review assignment have a lot more to do with following a canvas and not so much with the course substance itself.
For instance, some of the peer review criteria have to do with the narratives for computed statistics and plots.
We would need much more info/hard facts to make it much more interesting (i.
e.
got the job done
2.
A little light but still effective course
It was a good class to begin with however it would have helped to tailor it more towards newcomers to programming language in general.
It's satisfactory but I recommend reading the book.
The cross-references don't make any sense, and the assignments fall too short with regard to the content.
Advantages:1) I liked the idea of filming the lectures of Dr Seligman in the real class.
The whole course has very little about excel, rather about aweful a lot of data models.
Came to know some basic research strategies.
Less motivating to submit the tests and invites me to focus only on the preseed video and excellent links to other extra sources.
Went in a slow pace.
You cannot submit your quizzes nor your program assignment unless you're a paying member.
This is the first time I ran into such a class in Coursera.
Sad.
Please allow non-paying people who want to learn, to participate in quizzes and peer graded assignments, like other institutions are doing.
It was helpful to me and I hope that It help more to another students.
Not a lot of interaction with other classmates.
Brief and accurate course.
A fascinating course but delivered in a rather wooden fashion by the lecturer.
The course is quite short (videos are usually only 3-7 minutes long) and therefore could be completed very quickly and/or need quite little time investment.
Could use more hands on coding
Too much material covered in this course.
This is a nice course
Then also m
However some of the material needs adjustment, search strategy related material especially.
It annoys a lot...
I'd like to suggest the following: mentor to assist students, review of codes I found lots of glitches, one quiz rather than two, cut back on timeframe.
Though i have to say i learn new stuff, but i which it had more content to learn more.
Graphlab.
The job of the student is to catch these boxes and balls and to put the right balls in the right boxes in order to make a staircase out of it to climb (at least) one of the giant stair up.
A good teacher makes sure to throw the concepts first than the details and to clearly specify which balls go into which box, as well as which boxes go inside/over which other boxes.
But most teacher simply throw the balls and boxes in an not so well structured manner, so the poor students try to catch as many as he can, but also miss a lot of them.
it gives a broad intro but you have to take it slow
If you're new to Scala and/or functional programming, then the material covered here will be very valuable.
However, I was fairly disappointed.
There are many interesting elements in the course but one of the coaches I can't connect to.
His videos start in Week 1 and continue through Week 6 in building a basis for understanding the scientific research on meditation.
Segev is so knowledgeable and I think he tried his best to make easier but as I said it is difficult if you are just interested.
Not worth the effort.
I would be for sure ready to pay something to get a longer and more detailed course on this topic.
Its a good course for beginners
the professor gave lots of links to interesting external materials.
You may need to study a couple of other resources to understand the course.
Well, such background is not a prerequisite, but the student needs such information to successfully finish the exercises.
Interesting course!
need more lectures.
Some information must be changed because offer bad view.
Teaching and lectures are complicated.
Also, some of the case studies are outdated as i could see the course was developed in 2014. given that its a digital marketing related course, it becomes all the more important to have more recent and relevant case studies for this course.
I've picked up the nuances of branding via reading materials outside of this course, through my professional network, etc.
Week three was about managing research and planning.
It would be interesting to include, as well, critiques to the concept of depression as well: there are transdiagnostic approaches expanding quite quickly, besides classical critiques of DSM categories.
I cannot imagine anyone watching 3 minute video, doing something else and returning back to it.
Scott and Maxim are the best.
It's ok.
It's quite hard because of the english language.
The importance of this course is huge.
It then ends on a peer-graded assignment.
I also would have like it if Roger would have highlighted or circled, or something to specify where in the slide he was talking about.
But it is more like a brush-up for already c++ programmers.
Although they where important topics the course could go more in depth on at least 3 or 4 of those topics.
This course was splitted in order to get more money, and we know it
Isn't music all about feeling?
It would be good if more explanation and more examples are demonstrated.
It is clearly made to be accessible to people from all around the world, and takes the content very slowly.
Did not enjoy the teaching method of Prof. Caffo.
Lacks the hands on learning experience i was looking for but a great overview.
empty of value
However, its content is aimed at professional project managers - useful but not exactly what I was looking for !
I had to rely on transcrips: downloaded and edited.
I do not enjoy this course as much as I did in IIPP.
If you are just interested in getting touch with programming, instead of learning Java like I, go to take IIPP.
I think the first week should appear later, probably should be swapped with week 2 or even 3.
That's why I don't put 5 stars.
Very interesting!
I didn't know anything about programming and needed a lot of help with this course.
I think it will help us more if some topics are explained in detail.
I actually had to take additional course alongside of this course because although it was not mandatory, it was better to know how to use these software.
163.
com in China to watch the introduction part.
This sad fact undermines the integrity of the final as an actual test of ability and comprehension.
Also how come for a programming course the slides with code are so poorly formated??
It will rather improve your skill of understanding highly intellectual texts and will show you some interesting stuff about the brain.
If you've never had a course using Xcode, this will be a steep-learning curve.
I also would have enjoyed more discussion of rhythmic entrainment, the social cohesion hypothesis of the evolution of music, the roles music plays in human life, the way that bodies synchronize, and more about the relationship of music to emotional regulation, meaning, and personality.
A very interesting course and a good introduction to the topic.
I would appreciate a bit more of detail in some topics, butI enjoyed it a lot.
Very helpful.
On the other, you may be lost in the last part of the course.
A bit basic, but I guess that's what should be expected of an "Introduction"It would be nice to get a more advanced alternative course
Handy and Informative
Some of his information was useful.
Mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another - that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervision.
All in all I think this is an OK course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated.
There is no TA or instructor participation in discussion forum; hence my advanced questions in forum (intended to learn beyond the course) went unanswered.
Hence it was easy to do the assignments and quizzes without watching the videos.
I recommend that specializations should follow this trend, so students who find it difficult to access Internet can use the book as a guide.
More examples are needed to understand the concepts especially Tuples and DIctionary
should be only one to two videos.
The lab-based videos were the most interesting.
basic knowledge about synthesis that you get anywhere on the net.
This course should be given a basic or starter level tag.
Nice job !
This course needs you to PAY!!!
Good material but short explanation and no detail exercises and solution practices before the final test makes the test a bite hard to resolve.
Very useful!
Also some of the elements come down to management style.
No enthusiasm to hold attention but good content
Positive Psychology takes a one-sided approach by looking only on the plus side.
The assessments lack effective feed-back to support the learning process, given that after taking the quizzes you will only know if your answer was right or wrong, missing any instruction about the course content itself, and the only peer-assessed piece misses a feed-back section which may help to improve future writing.
The total number of classes could be reduced (a lot) and still provide the same message
Then I was graded after only finishing 4/5 of the exam.
I red the articles coupes of time but in a specific questions, the answers, it seems, that we should answer from our own memory because badly it`s not mentioned in any article or in the video of the teacher.
Thanks
It's really informative and helpful.
I will definitely recommend it.
Video Orientation is not proper.
That said, I did learn some from this class.
Good for beginners.
The grading seems to round up to 100%, which makes the assignments that are already generally easy far too easy.
This module is not the same level as the previous ones, giving a superficial view of several package but not on any deepens.
Other then the certificate, I find this course not much of value.
When you put both together it awfully seems like the university tried to diversify its communication and that the only objective of the course is that you enroll in a degree.
This is basic practice when lecturing on science generally.
Either way I'm loving the course and thank you for producing it!
But the content is great!
It just have to be updated as things change so fast!
First, the lectures are a bit disjointed.
The power of a cost-benefit analysis is enormous and it could be even broader with a personal interpretation and with a high level of awareness.
Well done with the aim of the course, just develop the approach impact.
p.
s the part with the guy that is apparently in Asia is really chaotic and I couldn't follow that amount of short videos.
This is the first course i have done from Coursera.
Some of the materials mentioned in the course were hard or impossible to find.
A case-study method I believe is optimal for this subject.
Challenging, but it gives a good idea on rprogramming, should be taken with other learning tools outside coursera
I like the comparisons between past physical wars and current cyberwar.
It is very shame, that there aren't any exercise after each week.
There was a lot to try to remember from one quiz to the next and I have memory problems, but if you're a person with normal memory abilities, I guess that wouldn't be a problem.
There really could've been 2 classes for cleaning data.
It's as if the course material was quickly thrown together and not reviewed or tested.
I would recommend anyone who wants to expand or create a knowledge basis in finance and financial institutions take this course.
Course is really helpful for whom start develop website, however, question set is too small so student can guess its answer in few trial (I don't like it).
At the end, I admire your effort in these series and will keep joining the next course.
I'm sorry but the course seemed rushed, and it isn't great marketing for the Bayesian approach.
Really frustated with this course.
Not for complete new developers.
In the end it is a good course.
should have more focus on talking about data.
table, "tidy data" principles etc.
More explanation of the concepts is needed as some things are really difficult to understand and you have to search outside the course to understand them.
Exercises in the course were very poor, simple and did not require coding, just changing one or two lines.
Also I do not plan on using R in the future so this part of the course was not very relevant to me, but it was not the hardest.
Too much emphasis on irrelevant fact-repeating (eg date a convention was signed) rather than content and implications of the content for practice.
If you don't have an interest in law then you won't find this class very interesting.
As someone who bought this course as one large pack (four courses, one capstone project), it would've been nice to see more intersection.
It's clear and offers a very good foundation.
Also, they don't seem to be updating the material.
I guess one of students that made supplementary materials with marker will do much much better.
Anyway, thanks for the course.
Request coursera to open assignments for audit students as well.
Fortunately data of csv format is provided, so you can complete it anyway but again, don't expect a smooth ride.
Also the lecture tends to cover general concepts than mathematical details.
I spent more time searching google for information than I did the lecture videos because A. the lecture videos are not named or indexed in such a way as to make it easy to figure out which video to rewatch and B. in many cases the particular thing I was trying to do wasn't covered at all.
The structure of the lectures as well as the assignments might need some redesign.
In the lecture, I think it might be better to explain the algorithm very clearly without talking about any coding details first, and then have some lectures explaining the code implementation.
This was a very basic course.
I appreciate that it is bringing me up to speed for the next courses but I found the learning pace to be a bit slow with very simple test assignments.
The practical code implementation assignments were great.
I did not understand the submitting process till the fourth week.
It was just okay.
Nice explanation and nice tasks but the course is designed for graphlab.
Good course, gently showing an introduction.
I thought the information was good but could have been better presented.
The activities are fine.
Bayesian techniques are missing.
not much is taught here but I guess should be a good beginning for the specialization.
The comments back were very good, but the grade remained a non-passing one.
I didn´t like this course so much.
As I said, anyway, it has a plethora of notions.
There was some nice content, but not practical enoough
The biggest problem was the un-moderated participation of at least one other student.
I found the modules repetitive and felt the course could have been shorter, but i did take away some useful tools and it did reinforce some good practices i was already doing.
It is easy to find more in-depth material freely available, on the McKinsey website for example.
I'm a female and would appreciate leadership/encouragement via role models from educators in this traditionally male-dominated field.
and uh fnck y=u
well, it's the previous part of the Python for everyone.
Course only drilled down on specific aspects of excel that were inclined to regression analysis which is just one aspect used in business analysis
I think it might look more professional if there`d be a modern design as well.3) The teachers are quite difficult to rate.
This course does a good job overall of framing the importance and challenges of working with big data, and certainly inspired me to want to learn more.
The do not go over loops, conditionals or basic C foundation that would help.
just a little hard to figger out what's going on and what's important.
Far too basic in content.
For a free course you get a lot of information and it is very easy to get a 100 on every quiz.
Some really good pointers.
The quizzes can be very searching and you really need to have paid close attention to every word (however quickly or slowly it passed by).
I would have liked more practical exercises.
Sometimes it was helpful and everyone involved learned something.
The first two assignments certainly tested knowledge of the subject however the last two assignmnets were lacking.
The assignments and theory are interesting enough to get you started on world design.
The pratical exercises helps to consolidate technics and expertise.
This course would have received five stars but there was no discussion forum and the weekly assignments lacked clear explanation.
The Pandas documentation is really only so-so and it would have been nice to have more guidance through the course materials.

I did really enjoy the course.
However, the knowledge gained in this course is fascinating and I am thankful to the instructors for attempting to instruct more people in regard to this field and the details of it.
Then it suddenly chnged the order and I didnt find a conclusive end
I believe, the issue arises from slides based teaching, where a slide of texts is presented and then there is a long monologue of how that system works from start to end.
but the reality was disappointing and will have to improve.
of videos/presentation to just one or two.
I really liked the 2 first weeks, but when it came to the week 3 and 4 I started struguling more understanding the meaning of the multiple equation that where explained because of a lack of real life context use.
Great course Great Instructor!I really enjoyed the course.
Perhaps online courses are not the way to understand such a complex subject.
The videos and interviews were great and I loved the transcriptions - they made life so much easier to make notes and annotate from.
The main issue I have is with the 'peer' marked work throughout the course.
Several of the lecturers are unusually monotonous and do not express excitement about the subject matter.
Thanks a lot Coursera
The subject is really interesting, and some of the shown approaches really "close to the edge".
However, there is too much "cut and paste" from other courses.
To much disconnect between assignments and lectures
Was expecting more videos than readings.
The course has a good content.
So i had to consult these additional resources when i find lectures confusing.
Course Assignments were really simple.
It's pretty basic.
Good for a beginners course, could be a little more challenging.
Could raise the difficulty a little.
The course is too short and I didn't learn much.
The assignments are not well described and the autograder is very finicky.
Week 3 on Mobile SEO was very insightful.
What are the problems, how do I solve them, give samples.
This course provides a good understanding of the DT steps with concrete application examples.
maybe explain variables on hardware and variables as pointers.
I feel like some of the content from R programming could have be included in the toolbox course in order to take advantage of the relatively light load.
This course was okay.
This course would not be useful for anyone who has any previous knowledge of ML.
Many reviewers have taken issue with the software used.
Maybe this is just a simple introduction course but it also seems like the topics are covered in a very vague, abstract way with little exploration on a deeper level.
This was a great course.
some of the stuff was not mentioned properly, like for last quiz how to expoert data from mongodb
the set up for the course was choppy, with random intervals of questions.
Gread course, shows the basic of IOT.
It matters because, it's distracting while listening the class.
Last assignment was *painful*: Poorly described instructions, outcomes/outpu; the grader was opaque and largely mute.
The course content is not up to date.
Not according what I expected
The technical treatment is hands on and gives a really good fell for how bitcoin and blockchain works compared to several other sources where treatment is superficial.
There are several parts of the course I was not able to get a clear understanding - such as implementation of the actual bitcoin core in the stack based script.
Could decrease the amount of video and quiz, relocating to another week course or Mooc.4) Feedback: Teachers need to leave a contact way (facebook, twitter, etc.)
I think this course is ok but it is not enough.
on Spark Streaming, etc.
The Grader often returns opaque errors ("The Grader Failed"), when the actual problem was that the program ran out of memory or out of disk space.
The topics are all very basic and the audio/video is sub-par, but the course offers a coherent overview of the core topics of time management and several useful tools and resources together with a few pointers to relevant literature on the topic, such as David Allen's GTD.
Applying all of the techniques presented in the course is a surefire way to enhance one's own productivity both at work and in the private life.
I was however surprised that its not all about modelling and the sorts but incorporates some business aspect about the fashion industry.
Add more case studies videos.
Last module was a bit obvious (IoT applications)
Apart of that small issues, overall the content is quite important and the instructor is good.
Should be an optional course rather than part of the specialization.
Otherwise it is not at all challenging.
Relevant materials, but lecture delivery is rather dry,
For example, I did use two squares as the assignment asked, but I changed the transparency of them, so they form a new square when overlapping.
Very interesting!!
Discussion forums for this course was not quite helpful.
Good introduction, it would be even better with a few more presentation on SWIFT.
You had to do your own research into getting packages working in spyder etc.
I'd probably recommend that learners learn some python separately and read the docs for pandas.
This course tells you which models to use and how to implement, but does not tell you the rationale behind (maybe the theories are too difficult).
The teaching staff are really helpful and answer every question you raise in the discussion forum.
Should you still feel a quibble, let me suggest that you contact the Department of Philosophy, ask for someone expert in symbolic logic and run it by him/her.
It will be better if we can learn more about tactics and methods of personal branding.
Fundamental knowledge for researcher.
A minor thing that I also didn't like was the form that the slides were presented.
It is not complete, you have to guess many things and find additional materials somewhere else to pass all course quizzes and assignments.
I found the quizzes very conceptual, which was interesting, but trying to find the correct answer with no feedback as to how something was right or wrong made for a weaker learning experience.
I quickly lost interest when the second course module repeated a large amount of content from the first module--I think a better overview or editing approach could have fixed that.
The faculty of this course represent a wonderful assembly of knowledge and experience.
I was sad that they ditched the last two courses though - was really looking forward to them, and the specialization feels really incomplete without them.
I understand eating veggies in place of other foods (i. e. - processed foods) as I eat very little meat anymore.
It was a little bit dto summize the main points of each lesson.
There were some very useful comments from other students but I also need some help from people who are real professionals in it.
It really help to go further studies in Big data.
With the same difficulty and amount of material.
It was really frustrating that the autograder and assignment instructions didn't match.
(I don't know why)!However As a PhD biomedical Eng, I'm learning alot from this specialization and I highly appreciate them for creating such amazing Idea.
The grader bugs considerably, and the questions are often not well defined, which requires a lot of unnecessary trial and error to understand what exactly the question was about.
Unlike the previous courses I took in this track, there was almost no interaction in the forums and also no-one to give feedback.
As English is not my first language.2.
Peer review is an understandable part of this course, but it has limited utility as the only feedback mechanism in a course populated by beginners.
This course is still quite new.
It is obvious that a lot of effort has been put into producing this course but the assignments were just a bit too difficult.
The approach of teaching has to be changed more examples with clear explanation has to be given.
Very basic explanations, maybe will need to make it more thoughtful!
Material was interesting.
Some of the lessons aren't clear enough to follow
I know a lot of work went into preparing this material.
The first few weeks were a little rough
Basic and easy for beginners to grasp.
That's why I only give a 3/5.
Also the lack of in session quiz modules or weekly quiz module to re-inforce learning is disappointing.
It's also possible that i was expecting a lot from a course on design thinking and what it turned out to be was just a scratching of the surface of what the definition of Design Thinking is all about.
It makes no sense.
Interesting subject matter, but offered in an insufficient way.
The textbook PDF is good.
It would have been nice to have assignments working with real bitcoin (or testnet) transactions, sigs, verification, hashing, etc.
Anyhow, I'm enthusiastic about this subject matter, so I'm just happy the course exists, but don't expect a glossy polished course... it's a rough ride.
Here is another Bitcoin course that looks good: https://www.
pluralsight.
com/courses/bitcoin-decentralized-technology
The only reason that I am giving 3 star is the design of the quizzes for each week.
The material was very useful, and informative otherwise.
Course is good but mentor grading needs to be a bit sorted as in they required almost 2 additional weeks to grade one assignment in total that is 1 month to grade an assignment so that needs to be taken care of
Based on my experience, I would not recommend a PWC course to serious learners.
In the discussion forum you can see lots of confused / frustrated posts.
For example, what do I do with the bootstarp files I have downloaded, where do they go, how to find their classes etc.
This course rushed through the material at the end.
good way to go back to the basics
I feel that more time should have been spent reviewing the Tableau features and eliminate the repetition of the material.
I felt like this course of the specialization wasn't as organized.
Most of the time, my motivation to learn this course is just doing its assignments.
At the same time, the assignments are somewhat difficult for those who are not familiar with Python, but for me it's just OK. What I want to make complaints about the assignments is that sometimes the Autograder is so rigid that I have to try one question over and over again until the Autograder "feels happy", and for me, sometimes the gap between "correct answer" and "incorrect answer" isn't so large...
And finally, thank you, teacher Christopher Brooks!
I would have liked to have known more of the overall value (if any) of the Jewish contribution in the context of Chinese economic development i.
e.
Good course to hone time management skills!
if the desired result is 34.1, to accept perhaps numbers between 34.099 and 34.101 -- perhaps consult with other course-runners for best practices here.
It might be helpful if the course provided a quick intro to running the assignments on DataBricks.
Good first effort.
Much of my December vacation (which I had earmarked for playing video games) was spent coding on this course.
The biggest gripe I have about the course is the grader system.
Above the average score
All peer graded exercises however were poorly designed and had awful correction criteria.
The landscape is quite basic and would require further development to be more relevant
But overall this course and the entire specialisation rely too heavily on Excel which seems a bit outdated when data sets are so much bigger these days (than the ones in this course).
But this is at the margin of usefulness.
The course was overwrought in general - seemed like it could have been accomplished in four weeks instead of five.
Quizzes are not challenging enough
It could be improved by incorporating some concepts and principles of a previous course, "Modeling Risk and Realities".
Thanks a lot!Financing is really large field!
I am aware of the fact that the course creators are not native English speakers, but, when formulating questions and answers, they should take the time to check their formulations for grammar and correctness (I am sure there would be no mistakes if the course were in French :) ).
I posted a couple of questions on the forums and, sadly, never received an answer.
The content was good, however Prof Clifton is very difficult to listen to and watch on the videos.
You have to dedicate a lot of time.
There were a number of different instructors and it was great to have a taste of varying topics from them.
Perhaps it is about quality and not quantity.
Loved the video lectures: more please!
It is a good short course to get an idea about Cloud Computing, Big Data and CDN.2 Points to the gentle instructor, Please try to elaborate more outside what is written in the slides.
The course is awsome to get motivation and quite informative.
Some assignment requirements are very ambiguous and in some cases the solutions are not matching the requirements of what was due.
Very targeted toward managers.
i thought the course is about showing us some examples of responsive web designs and how to make creative responsive websites as the title suggestbut the course is about 4 basic websites and how they are developed using meteorit goes on describing how to code this stuff and how the code logic is written and add a little to the meteor learning experiencei suggest you change the title of the course to be what the course is really about
Good content but extremely basic
I believe his is smart and everything but for me as non-native english speaker I found the way he speaks is extremely hard for comprehension.
Due to the lack of time and the inefficient/faulty autograder, I took a lot of my precious time.
the ideal editor, best practices etc.
That said- I really liked how the 3 components, css, js and html were stitched together to help understand interactive webpages using js.
Course is good and very interesting, but extremely little interaction takes place in forums, especially not at all from the moderators.
This makes the subject matter, although very interesting, very difficult to fully grasp.
The course is strictly focused on JS UI and DOM and should be probably preceded by another course covering javascript basics.
too easy,i wish we had more things do submit so we will learn more
Instructor rushes the course and does not explain much in the same level of details as respective quiz requires
I want to give 3.5 stars but there is only option for 3 or 4.
Given that it's geared more towards wanna be managers in this field.
Grounds you on what you can & cannot do with data science.
Good Luck.
Apart from the rest, the final course case studies were brilliant and helped us to collaborate our understanding of the course.
nice syllabus overall with great exercises.
wish it would teach more commonly used excel skills in business e.
g.
Good but nowhere near as in-depth as some of the other courses found on coursera.
However, I believe that this course must be reorganized in two different courses - one would be about artworks and understanding of art, another would be about teaching techniques in art.
For example the recommender systems quiz and programming assignment have nothing about factorization except a single superficial question.
There were few mistakes on the slides and should be rectified atleast in the pdf of the slides.
I do not believe this is an accurate reflection of ones full understanding of project management with the given rubric.
Some differences between spoken and voice recognition subtitled text.
You can get high marks but still be unable to utter a single word or read any Kanji characters.
The old version was more interesting.
I have given an extra star for the free license software received.
Didn't find the course as challenging as the Machine Learning course.
The assignments need to be more challenging.
This "should be" a five star course.
Not the same thing and a little disappointment.
If I could give a half star in addition to the 2 given, I would.
I would give it 5 stars but , staff really needs to start reviewing assignments because there are a couple of bad apples copying the work of other students.
As far as I know the student was not a mentor/TA, but It would have been most helpful for staff to weigh in on some of the student's post.
You are not actually writing any code for this particular course.
The main audience would be analyst/data professionals that have privileges to pull data but not modify data.
Assignment is only allowed for students who purchased the course.
I found the approach stale and western-centric, as the content actually covers western Europe and the stretch of its influence through the time period.
This might be just a personal opinion, the tips given in this course are rather intuitive.
Also the final assignment is bit ambiguous, more clarity is required.
Meh.
In my humble opinion it is necessary to review some points in this module:1) Video Content: Making more dynamic, switch between explanations and slides in full screen.
I liked the content of this course and for the most part I thought it was pretty decent.
I enjoyed a lot of this course, especially the parts about evolution and social intelligence.
I also found glitches in the materials, and many of the questions and grading rubrics are unclear or ambiguous.
If you are really new to robotics you will need to spend at least 40-50 hours a week "discovering" enough of the details to pass the course.
discussion thread should be answerable and solution to the test should be available...
all other things are good.
The content of the course is alright and up to date.
There are no notes for the course and the structure is quite loose.
Fun teacher, but very limited information.
The course was very dry compared to the other courses I have taken.
But the class is more like a history class.
I feel this course is designed in a way that may be too challenging to those who know nothing about music, sound, or biology.
I think one of the issues with this is there aren't really many active folks on the discussion, so it is difficult to try to find a solution to problems you are having.
Nice lectures with lot of good information.
Self-assessing assignments would be helpful to "try" the tests before actually attempting them.• The course is actually 5 weeks long (not 6 as stated, since there's an "empty" week).
A whimsical introduction to game design and the springboard for a Specialization Certificate, therefore important to take.
If you are looking a general HTML Course, this is for you.
Excellent course as far as content is concerned.
Everything is explained in a big rush.
However, the materials are someway monotone, the subject is addressed in general terms, which is understandable given the time set for the course, but it may had been better by focusing on concepts instead of examples.
Hard to understand JS part.
Too basic, lack of academic insights, too much simplification of the concepts.
Suitable and for sure insightful for participants without any business background whatsoever, but not for others.
The concept and overall material covered was exciting.
nothing more
I wish we had also the Chinese characters as in the first course; there were problems with the computer assessment of some of the quizzes.
The early part of the course does not make a compelling argument for why we need to analyse complexity.
Quite disappointed, I thought we'd have something more structured or at least different from the previous courses.
The content is here and good, but I was expecting reviews from pro U.
X and not student like the previous courses.
The good upgrade though is that we have clear examples of submission before we send ours.
and hence I was expecting more from the course.
Also, I would like to mention that the quality of video lectures can significantly improve as some videos that were shot in an external location had too much noise and it was a distraction to focus on the lecture.
The video quality and content were good.
The professor himself is of deep knowledge and proficient experience.
There's no intermediate material to test your skill.
Pretty good overview for simple business metrics definitions and basic level analysis.
With many thanks to the instructors, I expected to learn more.
Its good information but not quite what I was looking for in terms of actionable steps that I could take to engage with stakeholders from different countries!
I think it looks good tho.
Overall not a bad course.
For peer review detail evaluation guidelines is need.
Missing more practical examples.
The course is helpful but incomplete.
The video lectures are very short and uninformative, but the weekly reading list is very long and much more time consuming that the actual tuition.
It is a very simple and smooth course for new comers, i think it would be better to have more challenging tasks and more related to a real world, that's why i've put 3 stars.
The coding assignment is quite easy, since the code has been already written, the ONLY thing you have to do is RUN IT...
The improvised round-table discussions of meta-poems by Dickinson, Stevens and Mullen (module 4, lesson 4) initially seemed too colloquial and not incisive, but then I realized they had value as models for how to grope into an initial understanding of a strange poem.
There are courses that offer better level of details and better course materials and presentation .. and also for free ..
However this course is a best-effort course and is helpful for beginners.
Good "basics" course.
Quite basic.
Still there is much to learn from these contents.
Material is relevant.
The course itself is poorly designed, homework is hardly connected to the content of lectures.
The tutoring quality are over the top teaching with well done mentoring and high quality materials.
Unsure the value it has when you don't even know SEO at the level one would need in order to get a job in SEO.
The course is thorough and well-explained, but the tests' questions and answers are absurdly badly-designed so they become very difficult.
This is a very good course to learn some basic expressions and, most of all, get a good first grasp of Chinese pronunciation.
Neither course are supposed to go in depth with proofs, but I felt the regression course was at the right level and this course degraded too far.
but his prepared lectures were much briefer and consisted mostly of presenting bullet-point lists.
).
Supposedly, there is work going on to update the course, so hopefully future students will get a better experience.
But coming from Stanford and someone as educated as he is, that was shocking.
Not really technical, but a good overview over the past years and even centuries...
There is a couple of interesting tasks to do.
Cons: the material is mostly lectures, and there is even a video where lecturer just reads the article from Wiki (Splay tree - has the same information with same lack of some proofs).
(There is no science talk at all here...)
I thought I´d see more about improving practices to negotiate and convince the other part in a negotiation.
Excessively short course.
I liked the idea to submit the exercises and count on other students to review it, however, its a little bit annoying the exercises.
The instructor was clear most of the time, but there were places were the concepts were unclear, probably 80 percent was on target.
I was hoping to learn some production quality environment basics e.
g.
It was very distracting.
I am looking forward to deeper introduction.
Especially the programming assignment on cached results.
It is OK but too broad to get actionable learnings
The communication with the server and what would look like the final working product is not explained at all.
But, in my opinion, the course should go deeper in the different parts of the English grammar.
The primary lecturer is a little boring.
My previous coursera courses where on data science, machine learning, etc.
Obviously they were relevant but this should be more clear in text and video.
This is a 'beginner's course' but the final coding project was next to impossible to pass.
too redundant
Good introduction to Pandas.
But I think some important issues in the real world are not discussed enough here, like how to treat missing values, how to deal with messy format data.
However, they could have shown more real-time coding, rather than just scrolled through powerpoints with the Command Window pasted.
The jump in flow seemed abrupt and the relevance of some of the contents (regarding Future's) was not clear.
Unfortunately, it also relies heavily on graphlab instead of using open source software.
The answer is probably no.
But the pace is too fast.
Tips are also not needed and misleading.
However, I almost dreaded logging in to watch the lectures; they were often boring me to tears.
The lack of feedback for the assignments leaves you with important knowledge gaps and that's a serious flaw for a course that offers so much most of the time.
It's not a problem of the Coursera platform, as in the previous course, the teacher filled the quiz with all the explaination of the correct and incorrect answers.
So, should i suggest this course?
It was a great start to data science but also students should have it in mind that the material presented in the course won't be enough to get through it.
I think that's a great combination.
It's very helpful to polish my educational skills as a engineer
There is a lot of confusion and oversimplification in the considerations of consciousness and self awareness, and the implications of those things for emotions in humans, that would I think have had a better treatment, if the prof had pruned out some of the other stuff (perhaps ethics, or artificial intelligence, for example).
I'm hoping that as this specialization moves beyond introspection to interacting with others, it will get better.
And I love English and find grammar interesting in general.
There were however two issues that I did not like.1) It is not well supported and given that the technology is proprietary, there are few other places that offer support (i.
e.
Its informative and easy for beginners
Again, peer review was unnecessarily harsh because people don't understand the flexibility and nuance of writing, but it's definitely informative and has made me a more mature academic writer.
Nevertheless the Course was a reminder of many Things I learned before, and brings up some interesting historic connections and key points.
However, if you try this starting from no programming experience it will likely be extremely hard to complete.
In some slides the end content was skipped.
Better would be if some person is always present on the screen.
Good introduction, but not enough details.
The course should give more details.
I missed some practical exercice to put in practice the knowledge acquired.
The difficulty of this course warrants video lectures to convey many concepts and techniques, such as the Fitch system.
Hopefully you can add video lectures back to this course.
Too little detail but nice course as an idea.
My sense was that not much effort went into the creation of this course.
But I found the content not to systematically organized....
I watch Scandinavian TV and films from the U.
S. via Netflix, Amazon and MhZ Choice via livestreaming.
Therefore, as a system designer, it is unclear to me as to why I would ever pick Pandas over the rest.
The videos were generally well done and interesting, but did contain factual errors almost every week.
Unfortunately the instructors were absent from the forums after a couple replies the first week.
Overall a decent course to audit, but I think it was almost too repetitive and lacked a lot of substance.
Some lectures were repetitive from one course to another.
The best part of this course was, of course, the videos.
The extra work was not even part of the assignment classification -- there should be a bonus question for students who carry out the advanced part of the assignment!
Many errors appeared doing exercises, material needs to be updated - many node modules already deprecated.
Could have been one of the best on Coursera but a little broard in scope and not for beginners as more is required than taught.
The professor is very good.
Good introduction, but the professor could have been more descriptive about how to use git/github.
Which is a good cause, but I would rather they had spent that time teaching me something useful.
All algorithms were black boxed.
However, I was expecting more practical training on coding different programs with various ways.
But assignments are not much related to parallel programming specific issues.
its nice
The course could have been marked by 5 stars if it weren't for the promotion of a commercial Python library developed by one of the speakers.
very helpful but i think it is too short, i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for
The materials are not deep enough.
I would of like to study succesful cases with performance indicators and their impact in sustainable development of their action region.
especially thanks colleen
Certain aspects of the course could be improved, particularly in the way the material is presented.
The assignment is very confusing because some questions refer to some 'previous' statement while fail to clarify which is related.
Whenever examples were given, things became much clearer, but there often weren't examples.
The hands on exercises are boring and do not engage students.
New technologies are not explained in detail in a layperson's term.
In fact, just doing the Swirl lessons could be good enough.
If you are a prospective student and you want the certification, then you'll HAVE to take the course.
I have many doubts about the argument given in the lectures, and I myself can offer many counterexamples and counterarguments.
It is perfect for nonprogrammers.
The philosophy of this course is to teach through example problems by explaining and solving them.
The exercises are very well designed and reinforce the concepts very well.
It was pretty hard for me and I barely made it in under the deadline (jumping session to session to complete).
Introduced me to some cool ideas, web services and ideas for basic web design but isn't really a beginner course.
It is somehow good ... not excellent!
They are terrible and clearly not in the field of profession of the creators.
All in all, it is an average course, but I can recommend it to anyone interesting in the topic, because it does its job.
It has lost "coherence".
Also some assignments require methods and functions that were not covered in video lectures.
need more engagement and exercises before every week task
You really need to take the full course to evaluate if this is a great one.
This is an amazing, interesting course!
I can only imagine the work that it takes to develop and launch a course like this.
The first two weeks are about CSS and HTML.
The course is not bad, but I felt that it was just a collection of common sense advice.
I do not think some quiz questions are covered in the lectures.
Some lessons were really abstract and I ended up looking for information in other websites to understand it.
the language of this video is to high, it's like to be for reading more than speaking ( Too Formal).
The Content is quite good, but it needs more time in order to fully understand it.
Good content, but the course setting does (at least for me) not allow learn the content long term due to missing reading material.
), but for those who audit, being excluded from the discussions and the tests at the end of each unit made for a "less than" experience.
Many people ignored the grading criteria and gave me a lower score than was warranted, despite having answered the question(s) fully, referencing lecture material and even including additional information sources (all of which was referenced with links).
Unique and useful course.
Overall, I learned how to learn!
Too much theory and history in the course, no practical applications.
you can’t just look at problems and solutions on stackoverflow to get insight into the tech)2) For a course labelled as “intermediate”, it presented very little detail.
I found myself guessing at the meaning of each week's modules before completing my assignments and more often than not I discovered little correlation between the videos and assignments.
However I really enjoyed the time period of each video, as I am the kind of people that tends to get a restless when the teaching gets too long
excellent material and great explanations!
Very hard to get starting from the second week
Somehow crumpled and not helpful
Basically he is reading you PowerPoint slides and adding very little to the lesson by watching and listening to him do so.
I understood the point that in script writing matters more than theory but I don't think that it's right that all marks I got I received from other with me with zero feedback from lectors and teachers.
Definitely I wouldn't pay for sertificate but as first step and making some ready draft for further polishing the script this course was enough.
Additionally, and this might just be me, but the experiments used to illustrate examples at times are difficult to understand.
Need allot of improvement
Good quality of videos and teaching materials, but I expected more content about gamification.
The course is not bad, but it teach Python 2!
Some informative, big picture information but I felt that it lacked some hands on understanding.
More material, or coverage of the existing material with more library coverage would have improved the course.
They could be assumed for 99% of people and I think it would be a good idea to create an optional preparation module containing them.
Good Work
The class was challenging, but mostly for the wrong reasons.
Nice course with many tips, but very enterprise and US oriented.
Some of the readings are very good, however a number of them are out of date for example 2012 in a space that has already rapidly evolved since then.
Overall, it is a course worth taking if you're looking for a good overview of finance, how the industry works and how it became that way.
Someone should spend a few minutes fixing all of this.
The instructor is great and she is very knowledgeable.
Too fast...
(https://www.
coursera.
org/learn/buddhist-meditation) From the course catalog: " Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World explores the immense variety of meditation practices past and present.
This whole course can be done in few hours by people with some experience in programming.
Quite advanced in contrast to the rest of this specialization!
I really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works.
Reading Blogger posts from 2006 on a Blogger blog that hasn't been updated since 2012 is not forward thinking in my view.
But the views are quite one sided and necessarily true when it comes to the understanding of the food chain.
nice course at least to start with
It's a good course, if you're looking to learn the basics of planning projects, and it doesn't take more than a day to complete, it's just a bit of reading.
Great course but for the amount of content provided and how much was taught this course is certainly overpriced...
still a good introductory course, teaching very basic stuff.
I really love the way Dr Chuck is teaching.
there are some fatal problems in its OJ system
It could be that relevant examples on using applicable functions to aid in completing assignments were not presented in the lectures.
Students may forget most of the content after finishing the quiz.
Has good collection of resources for improvement of communication skills
The Teacher is not a communicator.
C is also supposed to be a prerequisite but then he ends also ends up explaining basic C (prefixing his explanation with you should know this).
Especially ResFinder was really interesting to me.
Some of the examples are not compatible with Android studio and work only on eclipse.
Super basic, each week was only about 30 minutes of video lecture... but I think that was their goal?
Content is taught too fast!
Someone who has never taken such courses will probably find this course much less helpful.
My expectation was to have a deeper knowledge of HTML5, spend more time reviewing difference between HTML5 version and the last ones but, I didn't get it, this why I'm giving just 3 starts
A bit of a deep plunge if you've never coded before, yet too shallow to satisfactorily introduce someone skilled in other languages to the many peculiarities of R. I don't envy instructors trying to balance these two needs in such a short time.
It is useful!
Might be interesting as an introduction for Scala newcomers, though.
Spelling mistakes in slides is simply unacceptable in high-level academia, in my opinion.
Very basic introduction to financial markets.
Which is not correct
Particularly the part about chunking was a really good one.
Difficult to understand the video lectures at time but really useful content.
Even while doing this course, people were saying how they need to be a pack leader and how they follow what Cesar Milan does.
However, for those of us that know there is a difference, it was interesting to learn more about the differences between wolves and dogs.
(This is a research-supported study technique; it focuses attention on key points in listening/reading.)
Most of the course was dedicated to explaining particular problems, the solution to which was inevitably “then you train this really clever, one-line algorithm we have written for you and you query it for insights”.
I wish there were readings to supplement the videos.
The coding exercises all suffered as a result.
Just soft teoretical material - need add some "real life" exsamples.
The material is fine but the course isn't taught well.
I had to spend some time researching the web to work out some of the problems.
With those aspects I hope that the forums are monitored by the instructors for a quick feedback loop and the lectures are updated to be more detailed.
Good course, and well taught.
Great video, they should be longer and more detailed though.
Some of the information about these topics were treated in a more detailed and useful way in the introductory course
Good course overall
Introduction course to other courses, not much to learn here.
The quizzes were engaging but i think it requires some knowledge in use R for data science.
thanks for everythings my teachers:)I hope to visit you soon.
Interesting and exploratory but not much was really explained; he just kinda showed examples and said see what I mean.
This was a very baseline introduction and basically a summary of Pollan's books and ideology.
The course discussed a great deal of very important information, but the instruction was very rushed, and often lacked the specific details needed - for example, formulas were sometimes left out, and it was assumed you could/would just "figure it out."
From now on, I will think twice about paying for any course where all of the assessment is based on how my classmates grade me.
However I have to say I didn't do the optional readings.
It's a good, but timid, introduction to game development with Unity.
Not enough students to give review grading and earn a grade.
However, this is a great place to start!Also, the addition of R exercises are a great idea
Tries to be something for everyone.
Quality of the course is OK.
There are serious issues with the quizzes.
The content of the course is reasonable and gives an introduction to the uninitiated.
Also the lectures and quizzes could have been longer.
Forums feel neglected by the course tutor, lot's of question that someone knowledgeable should answer become random rambling as nobody is sure as to what the tutor actually meant.
Some energy-based proofs and the few formulas presented are inserted a bit adhoc and not properly explained.
Despite not being to my liking in terms of depth, It is a good course as a general understanding of what has been accomplished in robotic legged-locomotion, what the state of the art is and where to find literature.
This was a good introduction that bought in some new and previously visited concepts.
Learned a lot from the course.
This course is ok, but it gives only high level overview of cloud technologies.
Then I couldn't get motivated.
The course content was good but the assignments weren't structured that well.
Was expecting more of the how to's and a bit of programming or at least concepts of the programming/statistics, but I guess there are different interpretations of the idea of a crash course.
Definitely geared for people who work with data scientists but not in the data science field.
It includes several information about logistics field but it is not so sophisticated
This is not my learning style so I found it challenging.
As a Naturalist and bird lover, I was eager to take the course and glad that I did.
Very basic content, not that helpful - states what to pay attention to, but scarcely "how to".
Not bad, the professor is very comunicative but I expected a bit more of contents
The laundry listing of species in some of the lectures was a snooze fest however.
Found it to be a bit outdated.
This may be an artifact of trying to cram what other online course provide in 7-10 weeks down into 4 weeks.
There should be more challenging and more programing exercises.
The course learner community was supportive, which is fortunately typical for Coursera.
All in all, this project was *not* an effective capstone for the Data Science specialization.
so many video in pieces, and lecturers keep saying like" we will look into more details later" or introduction again and again.
Opening up quizzes to help feedback what we'd learned (for free learners) would have made the course much better!
For each problem, there should be an example so students do not have to spend too much time to understand or guess the solution.
I suggest creating a more detailed rubric that helps bring all the information together where those doing the peer review and those creating the documents can see the value of each part of the assignment.
I now understand the situations in which Data Science can best be applied.
Thus, I spent about 20 hours/week on this class.
This course is intended to tell about other courses but contains not so much useful information by itself.
It is better if allow me upgrade only when I finished this course.
I did like the instructor.
Too much unnecessary videos.
I miss the slides for static consulting alter the vídeo.
Maybe the word "introduction" can be taken into the title - as the course would serve as a good intro-course for practical application of sustainability.
Geoffrey (The Netherlands)PS: the videos of the Parkers can be deleted from my point of view
It was Ok.
This might work for someone with enough background in biology who needs to learn to code.
Didn't see TAs.
The course is really interesting, but it need a content review.
I think the instructor should add more solid training on GitHub.
I would have rated it better if there were more practical examples, advice and real-life situations rather than so much theory.
Doesn't provide as much of an in-depth info as I was expecting, but its a good course to get you started with hybrid app development.
However, the instructor was relatively boring and most of the material was common sense.
(Transcripts are available.
Wording of the last assignment limited creativity as it was hard to tell if you had to limit your pictures to 2 shapes,(as in one circle and one square), or 2 shapes(as in as many circles as needed and as many triangles as you needed, but don't add any squares).
One more written assignment would have been good (the one in week 2 was great), and perhaps more incentives or reminders to use the forum.
Preferably answers should not be binary, but provide the student with wide choice to gauge the degree to which performance on the exam truly measures knowledge acquired during the course (leaving little room for guess work, as it were).
Here I compare it with the data science course I took this semester (AC209a, Harvard University).
The actual subject matter is good if you have some experience with JavaScript.
One thing I do not like is the testing questions.
Good for a starter.
Thank you professor.
Great video instructions.
You can learn this stuff just fine at a stable.
Also, all concepts could be easily taught in Python rather than Matlab.
Great material never the less.
The videos from about week 3 to 4 have poor sound quality, but still understandable.
The quizzes were for the most part poorly written, and only somewhat correlated with the presentation of material in the lectures.
I could see this course being very good for absolute beginners with little to no knowledge of nutritional concepts or cooking.
It's simply impossible to derive from it whether the student did everything right, but it could be easily done programmatically.
Thank you for the lecturer, Rob, to prepare that great course on coursera platform for us to learn those knowledge in effective way.
No 'teacher' involvement in comments / questions.
I would be happy to discuss in further details :)
Focuses too much on Github.
Also, the core content feels like a hodge-podge of different sources thrown together to support the Professor's lexicon.
The video would be ideal as shown in week 4 of this Mooc: How the hotel shouldnt work with Expedia?
Though i learned a lot.
Possibly story-telling itself needs to be anchored more to specific usage occasions.
Presents a useful analysis framework, but with limited practical examples to learn how to use analytical tools.
Difficult and kind of tedious subject.
I suppose that's what research is for.
The contents were interesting.
The course title is a bit misleading.
Only after a while we understand their use.
The information is really great, but the format was tedious and dull.
A good course who teaches the way you have to do to write correctly a scientific paper, and gives an idea about the process of publish, it is useful and necessary for those who wants to continuous study and have their own work knows on the fields who works and research.
It is good for someone who has never had experience with web technologies before.
This material will also be more understandable to individuals with a statistical analysis background, not enough time is spent on explanation and it will be necessary to supplement the class if you don't have the proper background.
Skims over topics quickly and does not go into depth on how to write code effectively or build a database from scratch.
Discussion forum was a deserted place with little sharing.
The last week of the class should have been split across multiple weeks, and I'm disappointed I never got to do an assignment on latency or futures.
That being said, I'd still recommend taking any class taught by Odersky, and I learned a fair amount.
Really informative.
I also wish he didn't focus so much on the idea that dogs are from wolves, because again, many people revert to "this is how wolves are so this is how i treat my dog" it leads to confusion.
I guess it's necessary to give a roadmap for where the concentration leads, but I wonder if each lesson couldn't have been added in its respective module, or if at least the Foundations Module couldn't be shortened a little - or alternatively made a bit more challenging.
Although the instructor was good at presenting the information, I felt that the reference sheets should of had the phonetic pronunciations next to the Korean writing.
When Addressing the concepts of Ebola, SARS, or the concepts of anti-vaccination the content was vague.
The lectures were informative.
That being said, the most interesting part of the course is prototyping section.
The course is well put together, however they say you do not need any programming background, but you definitely need a little.
This misses out what for me is a vital part of the learning experience, regular feedback and reflection.
The course is ok, but it doesn't give any certificate of completition for free users (something that many other courses do give).
The tests are too easy, one can't learn properly from them.
Then there's this really awkward and long interview with his musical colleague (week 4) who didn't seem to know much about what he was being asked, and while watching their conversation, it's totally apparent in the professor's face that he wasn't getting the output he wanted from the guy.
Thanks for the vocal techniques.
All of them have been on a spectrum of good to great.
For instance, we were asked to create a development plan at the end of a week about hiring and before the week on development.
better training material and videos expected.
The few that do (and do it well) are having a hard time making ends meet.
This course gave a great opportunity to explore one's creativity, with assignments that didn't require us to have skills in particular types of graphic expression.
The teacher can explain mean things and in a second, speaks about totally incomprehensibe subject.
It's okay... but paying for a certificate it's not worth it.
In saying that, I really did enjoy it and the professor was great!
However, I would have liked to learn Chinese characters along with the pinyin, as in China reading the characters is just as important as speaking.
The teacher of this course talks toooo fast !
Course content is ok, but some lectors are really boring in explaining mathematical details.
Tasks are pretty easy, and this is from algorithmic perspective, because from programming there are almost nothing to do.
And overall it feels that there are not so much info as for 5 weeks course.
This course teaches us how not to make that mistake.
The course was nicely organised, though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking.
Course deals with many interesting theories about motivation, leadership, teamwork and culture.
It's ok; worth your time if you are trying to get into philosophy and want part of the proper foundation.
As such they cut out randomly, have issues with the sound volume, and often discuss material that was cut out prior to the section or should come later, but never does.
Not easy but worth the effort
Video Lectures are too short too.
Would have welcomed more or longer lectures, and more variety in the assignments.
A lot of course content could be as a prerequisite.
I'm grateful to the professor for constructing and delivering this course.
it's ok. i would love more practical examples.
I learned a lot though.
The were questions not related to the videos.
Interesting class and I learned some new stuff!
Some of the quizzes were easy so you did not need a lot of preparation, some of them were more difficult or troublesome, like the quiz for Deep Learning.
Several colleagues have the same experience with this course.
Tutorials was not matching skills to achieve assignments given.
Not sure how memorizing concepts from the Agile manifesto will help in becoming a better product manager.
I have the sense that this could easily happen with the Coursera material.
FREE, it's ALL FREE.#3 - The Science of Mindfulness against the Background of the Scientific Study of Meditation videos with Dr. Clifford Saron, neuroscientist.
However overall the topic is very theoretical, maybe add a little more connection of each introduced data structure with respect to its application would make the topic less dry and more motivating.
Recently, I got a certification of Machine Learning course of Anderw Ng.
So the first course of Machine Learning Specialization is too easy for me.
But I think it's not a matter of how easy it is.
This program poorly explain how algorithms workEven if the lecturers keep saying that we are going to study in detail in the later courses,it's very difficult to stand boring situations.
And there's a serious problem.
They provide data for programming assignments, which shows different results compared to the one in the video lectures.
I am having difficulty in understanding it.
The concepts go by way too fast..
I found I spent more time trying to get the course material working than actually absorbing it.
I really liked the lectures once they were working though.
Too much theory.
It is cool.
There is absolutely none.
I do everything step by step like in the video, and nothing works.
Good overview.
I wish that the classifications of the major cancer groups were more descriptive.
I felt that I learned a lot while taking this course because it held me accountable, but the course design could be much smoother.
In addition, the discussion broad is a little bit cold and lack of mentors to help students.
Very difficult test programs
I believe that through this course, I have placed in a better position to make sound investment decisions.
The course content is good but sometimes very fast paced.
Extra Stress: swift and English
The course needs an update.
too many issues with the DB's that needed to be accessed to complete the exams.
The course needs to be improved to make it more useful for students.
But anyway, it was helpful, because the more tasks you complete, the better you get.
The lecturer was very slow, and some things were not explained very well (while very simple concepts were often over-explained).
Also, I'm quite sure there were at least 2 errors in the weekly quizzes.
This is a course to get you set up with all of the tools that you will need to go forward.
Testing choice isn't great.
The overall content of the lectures is good but to internalise it there needs to be more 'work' for the students to engage in rather than just a quiz at the end.
I'm not sure there is a better way to teach this course; but it felt like I was left to my own devices to complete the course.
Starts very simplistically.
But you can practice a lot if you know something.
I think this is Coursera`s fault to begin with.
I think it won't hurt to give some more specific examples and methods used in each case.
I also don't think the fact that one has to pay so much to access the assessments, which many other courses don't do at all, is conducive to creating a strong engagement in the course.
but i saw a lot people below think this a good course so may be i am wrong.
The positive.
What a wealth of material!
However, I think it was too simple: assignments required no more than copy+paste from the lectures.
I understand the primary goal is to hook people up on how good graphlabs is, but I'd rather leaarn numpy, sklearn and other widely available tools.
The course was good, but I think that only it's really enjoyable if you have a dog.
I really like it.
Need to update assignments
It's easy to follow along.
The concepts taught are not taught in a structured way (although the way they are taught is good).
Additional literature is welcome.
The information is well presented but painfully slow.
If I look at the process mining course for example, a lot more video material is included (and its price is lower) with more concrete examples and practice.
Maybe a new term in each video or something?And I understand that the course was only four weeks, which doesn't allow much time for deep scripting analysis, but maybe the course should be longer than four weeks.
Overall a fun class and I now have two games to show off to people.
I still believe my original observations are valid.
Each student just answered the question proposed by the instructor and that was it.
The lectures are good, however the assignments are too much guided.
It might have been a better option to conduct the class in the instructors' mother tongue with English subtitles, though concepts are well enough communicated.
I think it would be more easy to understand the concepts with more examples
It's easy to start python with this.
There was no explanation about background mathematics.
It was a bit confusing to understand the topics and try to learn them by heart.
The presentation of lectures especially from Prof. Jianbo Shi are excellent - to represent Matrices in colours and give a intuitive sense of every formula(especially the Jacobians and treating the image blending process as painting) .
The bad part of this course is that pronunciations of faculties could be a little unclear and hence a very good transcript is required - which in this course is not upto the mark.
After each lecture you do feel like you've become an expert in that topic.
However, the course is very diluted.... Only 4-5 lectures over 7 weeks is too little content, especially if you are to pay the $79 required for certification.
If there was feedback after taking a quiz I'm sure it would of helped.
Very interesting subject.
My feeling is that this wasn't worth $30 dollars, and that such a small course was put together just to charge for one more module.
Distractingly weird hand gestures.
I found the course very basic, with no consideration of art theory beyond a level appropriate for classroom discussion.
Week 4 was really interesting !
This course is good, although it repeats a lot from the Fundamentals of Graphic Design.
This course gave me that kind of reciprocity.
Good instruction, but it was a bit too basic - many of these concepts are common sense to most people in college or beyond.
This course is very interesting, and everything is there should be known to start a business.
But basically, it just says to respect everyone and everything.
By using his book as the notes for lectures, he doesn't give himself a chance to prioritize content so it's kept clear in the exposition.
The 3 last weeks, excellent.
Instead, consider focusing the 4th week on NoSQL, and keep an assignment with it, maybe even the original Pig assignment that required and AWS account.
Brian, Jeff, and Roger: Thank you very much for all the data science courses, really great.
This is actually good.
If discounted the weekly videos with real examples of frauds, per week there was only about 20-30 minutes of 'real' materials.
There are errors in the materials, and since there is no instructor feedback/interaction, there is no way to find out what was meant (including in reading assignments).
Reading book you learn one thing, watching lectures another and then unrelated labs, which then culminate in something totally different during week 5?
Accessible introduction to basic learning techniques.
Please give some more(additional) exerciser which are real application using framework like Play.
Otherwise the course was great and I would recommend it to others for the knowledge.
Anyway I learnt some new things as well.
Grading rubric is too generic: If peers don't leave feedback then the student is left to draw assumptions from loosely-defined parameters.
But the way the instructor explained the course material was very approachable and easy for a beginner like me to understand.
Nice course but lot of troubles are arising during the completion of this course.
Some vides are too fast to follow.
However more details should have been better
The course is really worse than previous too.
The attached files are extremly needed to enjoy the course!
It makes me think that QC isn't a part of your workflow, and worry about the quality of future courses in this specialization.
Most other specializations are organized chronologically (i.
e.
excellent course but should be more in depth
The best course I have seen online is the Machine learning course by Andrew Ng.
I would have liked better tools to do this type of work.
Unbelievably difficult for understanding!
Overall, I think this course still needs some development in the way of exercises to familiarize the student with the practical exercises associated with machine learning.
It was quiet mathematical for a beginner like me.
I enjoyed the lectures, but I felt they didnt go into enough details on analysis of sequence data.
Basic but informative
I just wish I didn't have to spend more time browsing the internet finding material pertinent to answering his arbitrarily open-ended questions.
Good course for new learners.
The course was a bit to short, but still I managed to learn few new things.
Nonetheless, I still learned some interesting concepts and I am looking forward to course 3.
The course is good but it's stupid to make course only in chinese language.
It was very interesting and informative though.
It's best to keep going on one subject without interruption.
Unfortunately this course didn't offer offer a certificate or statement of accomplishment in any form at the time I took it.
I'd also like to have more written materials to go with the videos.
I found a little confusing the allocation of notes.6) Curriculum: Missed curriculum (biography) of teachers.
good but we need arabic language
The lecturer seems to be reading off the text - could be better.
More tips and tricks about Xcode as a tool would have been nice.
I would prefer a small project/assignment during the last week of the course.
First assignment i was clueleass on Kintr and how to generate report.
Thus moving from theory to application can be a bit abstract.
The overall impression is that different parts of the course were not reconciled with each other, leading to fragmentation of the course.
A bit basic/slow to start with.
These are complex topics, and just the quick overview doesn't fully explain them.
Especially when it is an online course, the lecturer needs to bring the story to life rather than simply reading with hesitation from the slides in most instances.
I would like to learn about this topic and the database access using Python, and I still think this is a very good beginning.
I would reccomend these course to almost all freshmen and sophomores as essential to building good financial skills for their future.
The structure of this course is kind of loose.
Rather than reuse parts of the old course it would have been better to have new content purpose built for this course.
Basic course and good for high school to undergraduates as the title suggest.
Very few topics are covered.
How do you modulate course difficulty when you could be targeting students who are somewhere between high school kids to computer scientists?
This should be at most a 1 week course, that is free.
Since this is the only course of its kind on coursera, you don't have many options either.
First, slides come with brief comments of instructor.
Finally, Quizzes could use some review, the answers don't often line up grammatically with the questions.
Not that detailed stuff.
would vastly prefer if this was taught using sckit-learn and pandas, given their broader use.
Simpler instructions would make the course more effective for those who aren't developers in their day-job.
Just an introduction, not so great.
This course could work better as either a longer course with more examples, exercises, and step by step instructions in excel, or as a smaller part of the first and third courses in the specialization.
Some seems repetitive from course one.
You have to get 80% to pass.
The course contained some valuable information, but the lack of projects even small ones didn't help much.
On other pages it shows I did and earned 41 out of 41 points.
Its a great course if you plan on spending large amounts of time searching the web for other resources to complete the optional assignments
On one hand - basics.
I was inerested about this course, but I couldn't understand enough - the speaker talked too fast and I've lost the main subject trying to understand.
Nice course, would be nice to have more exercises and more elaborated, but fair enough!
she can go in depth more and give us more and more information.
The course was interesting but overall very wide and didn't make a clear point.
Last but not least, I personally think the course lacks on additional materials.
It wasn't structured that well, Plus most of had to make a digital marketing report for the first time without even a sample of how industry experts expect to see when they look ata repot
It gives some good birds eye view of the topic, but I wish the course had more in-depth discussion of topics and more technical material.
This quickly became a statistics course, which although important was really difficult for me as I went in not expecting it.
However, Dr. Egger is incredible!
Hard to pay attention at times.
I can't give them too much slack for the dryness, after all it's coding.
:(but thnx any way for ur effort :D
In some instances, the code is actually "off-screen".
Good introduction to basics in Project Management.
IMHO it's better to reduce the scope but provide more details of key technologies.
Nice introductory course for database management.
In the week's final project, though the questions doesn't ask for them, be sure to explain your rationales.
I found an error in content that bothered me but did not interfere with the main points of the course.
Some times the questions in the test were in my opinion irrelevant to the material.
Teaches the history well, but doesn't focus much on helping to improve.
The Duke University team is good and they obviously know what they are doing, but they need to review this course and make it more simpler... :)
Week 2 of the next course - R programming - is kind of a kick in the head if you're not a programmer.
The content drags and can be boring
that will be typically encountered in an advanced undergraduate or MBA program.
It could have been better if the Introductory course to the specialization had little mathematical involved or could have been explained in simpler terms or with examples instead of showing the equation in the video.
There is no slowing down or speeding up for hard-to-grasp or easy materials.
This course is quite challenging for beginners.
The slideshows were my favored documents due to the inclusion of images and explanatory text.
The author of the blog might be very knowledgeable on his subject, but his blog it is full of useless jokes, very long to read...
Too slow, too vague, but you can feel the ideas behind have potential.
I would like more lecture, snippet of codes and explaining what they do and have us fill out part of a code by thinking through as oppose to typing out the whole thing.
Toughest class in the offering.
This seems intended to replace forum discussions but it is not a good substitute (and there are no forums).
I still recommend the course, but that's only because the material is so extremely important.
The course is really basic but the instructor is good.
The course is fine in the content.
Here are some of my criticisms:1.
I really liked the fact that we were given an overview of all the machine learning techniques before we actually delve deeper.
Very interesting material, but also very light instruction.
I think less of reading work and more video lectures should be included.
I would retake it if it was improved.
The javascript segment is better because the concepts are explained more in depth.
I recommend tons of reading, practical exercises, swirl is a bit of a savior and so is stackoverflow.
I know that this is exactly what will happen in the "real" life, but I think that some better guidance could guarantee the students spent a more even amount of time in across all steps.
All things considered, I think the Capstone was really interesting and likely took more than the 4-9 hours per week, but most of this is probably because of the problems I faced.
I believe that with a better guidance on the paths to follow or maybe some suggested libraries to use, a lot of "noise" (useless difficulty) could be removed and this course would definitely get more starts.
This is a quick run-through different types of distributions.
However, the lessons often did not connect to what was actually being tested.
It is a bit ambiguous the way it teaches a way to apply accountability, sometimes it is sometimes is not, it all depend on the circunstances.
I recommend try to focus in the fundamentalsonly.
Rate from 1 to 5" everyone puts 1 as my score even if I submitted it as PDF file, should be a yes or no question.
The course content was comprehensive, thorough and required note taking with preparation for quizzes.
Grade: B-.
Assignments were way too simplistic
However, as you advance further in the course, some of the math begins to lose consistency, while some of it just gets skipped.
Sad to know that I need to pay inorder to get a online certificate.
I think it should be about 1 week long.
Pros: The course content covers a lot of relevant topics on Database Management.
The clustering part was going well until it reached LDA.
The LDA module is very poorly covered, and also very hard to understand.
Too much practices and industries, but a little about the theory.
It's neat to imagine learning all of this stuff in four weeks, but one should be realistic.
Interesting course, but the evaluation process should be reworked with weekly quizz to ensure that the main concepts have been understood and a different final exam which does not assume that you already had the opportunity to apply and reflect upon what you have learned
A class on Modern American Poetry and Ezra Pound was only treated secondarily?
He was also very fast in responding.
Seriously, I and most of people grasp most of the ideas from the first time; even if not, I would watch the video again.
If you read the course contents - you already get 75% of what is presented in the videos.
A good course for somebody who knows absolutely nothing about the presented subjects ( like networking, what is embedded software etc.
However, I'm very disappointed that there are no video lectures at all.
Scatterplot, histogram can be much useful.
The course is very informative for those interested in data analytic and want to go for market research kind of jobs.
I still feel like I learned something though, but mostly from swirl which is a pretty cool thing!
More case studies perhaps?
Generally I like the contents of this course.
The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python, I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically.
Where it falls down though is the assignment auto-grader.
Needs to be a bit more complex and detailed in order to help people get a good understanding of the complexities and issues involved in project management.
A quick introduction, just what I was looking for.
I found the hands-on lectures very helpful.
Most of the homework assignments aren't graded correctly out of the box and have errors.
A better read would be The intelligent investor.
Great teacher, nice range of topics, very well explained.
Better have at least 10 programming exercises for each week.
It's very simple and direct, but make sure to follow this course up with lecture material that goes slightly more in-depth.
Also, the professors' teaching style may be confusing sometimes and require extra work to understand, especially when they didn't have a pen in hand and were just talking quickly to the air.
This is a decent course if you are looking for some very general guidelines and concepts about how your brain works to learn things.
The course is much too easy, to my mind.
Good starter setup.
It gives a brief outline and moves very fast and to create a LivePlan is a paid thing.
First, students are required to read at least 10 pages (art papers) about approaches in teaching AND at least 4 articles in museum's website PER WEEK.
It is basic course with simple information
I chose to use 2 shapes, but multiple counts and some people that thought this is not only 2 shapes, but 2 counts as well, chose to grade my work with the lowest rating due to unfulfilled assignment.
I thought this course will be a bit more helpful, there were some good methods I learned like the pomodoro and other concepts I wan't aware of before.
His teaches like someone of our age, like a friend, I appreciate that.
Classes moved very fast, especially in the video materials.
In addition, after a point in time, it became too technical.
For me, the exercise structure was more confusing than educating.
I've learnt how to access columns, rows, and specific values in a dataframe.
They did not even respond to a single question through the entirety of the course.
By the way, here is the syntax.
this makes this one difficult to follow.
I was expecting more modules on configuration management like deployment manager service.
If you're entirely new to machine learning, you could find some value in this course.
It really covers the basic and foundation of Philosophy.
Much better than the first course on the specialization.
It's hard to read the screen and quotes when they're only on the screen for a few moments.
Material is not very easy explained.
Good course for Starters
It was a goo start overall, tho.
Child Nutrition and Cooking was a pretty fun and easy course.
It is a "hey, look, there is something called pandas out there that may be very useful for you" but it is too introductory.
Much of the coursework was pulled from the original "Functional Programming in Scala" course, as well as the "Principles of Reactive Programming" course.
I dont know how the peer reviews are done and like everyone else says its hard to trust them.
I had a difficult time downloading peer writing to review, and I never got any feedback on my assignment.
I hope you continue the great work of illuminating millions of young people's interests through your great courses and organization.
It was way too simple for me since I already have knowledge in machine learning.
Unclear objectives and wrong input data.
Course Content was good.
It is not letting me submit my lesson 1 review without payment.
1 professor just did not make sense to me.
its a good course but have some problems in the quizzes
I enjoyed the tours round the historic sites and I thought the lecturer came over as warm and enthusiastic but it seemed he was preaching about a saint rather than giving a detached academic assessment of a historical figure and I found that it was hard to see the wood for the trees at times.
The problem though was the approach, in my opinion.
Getting more theoretical and less practical application on Excel application.
However, the final module is worthwhile, even if you know a little arduino programming.
This course is baby steps to Arduino programming.
2 weeks were balanced and thought-provoking and one was silly, but entertaining... therefore three starts with 2 stars taken out for ending a good course with a week of silliness.
For example, that geoload/geodump/where-data could be given as exercises during the course and joined at the end to make that map solution.
There should be more homework for practicing the material covered.
The very nature of the peer review system also guarantees you see a real range on the individual criteria you are evaluated on and the depth of the review.
could have lecture more.... the videos talks little about the spreadsheet provided
its more like here is how to do it magically.
The retrieval part of this course is great, it deserve five starts.
However, in general, it's a good course to have an overview and some useful tools of project management.
Average.
The only area of improvement, I felt, was the case study.
It could have been a little more detailed and has scope of increased level of difficulty.
There is no way a student could complete the course without having Python installed and a free licence acquired from dato.
com.
Students should be able to use any programming languages and scientific libraries to do their homework and the subsequent courses of the "Machine Learning" specialisation are excellent examples of such approach.
Interesting overview of group psychology - but in essence just a bunch of definitions and statistics.
I would have liked more focus on how the group dynamics works and how to influence these - and break the circle of unpopularity, the tools to overcome the aggressive stamp etc.
Also, I found the quizzes often had unclear and ambiguous wording.
Generally happy to have taken the course - but did not quite meet the description or my expectations.
As it stands right now, I -still- don't know the difference between a factory and a service, or even what a provider is.
The course provides a solid structure on which to build academic essays.
The content of this course is not self-contained.
I found the course a little hard to follow mainly because the video lectures would not load.
Some presentations are too kitch.
Very interesting course, providing a descent overview of the whole water management and policy question.
Maybe the use of some sort of autoclue, would help.
Last, but this could be more for the course editors, the instructor has good slides and material, but usually during the lectures the slides disappear (just in the moment one need to focus his attention in the written material) and the instructor appears in first plane.
I recommend this course for theoretical knowledge only.
I found the homework used topics that a beginner would not be familiar with.
The instructors are definitely knowledgeble about the material and clear about the presentation but a lot of the same matierial are repeated throughout the course unintentionally.
I have had many differences of opinions on the solutions based on wording in the requirements.
I've switched over to a similar course from University of London.
The lecturers in this course were very stiff and scripted and not overly simplistic in their explanations- something essential to avoid frustrating those of us just starting out.
Early in the course, I worked diligently on my written contributions to the discussion forums, but then there was so little peer response that I gradually came to understand that I was mostly just talking to myself.
It took tremendous time to complete and at least to pass it.
Ws hard to really get interested in the information in the way that it was presented.
Debugging experience.
We have many databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc), which have far more powerful features than what pandas can do.
The information is great, but I think they need to make this course in two phases because there was a lot of information to process and the assignments need more time if you want to do a good work.
Some of the lectures have slides available, some don't; some of the lectures have somewhat-useful subtitles/transcripts, others have incomprehensible garbled messes (I don't know if they're machine-generated or just transcribed by someone with no understanding of the material/vocabulary - logarithm != algorithm!
Why would I want to learn about AT&T for two weeks?
Still for unorganized people it will be useful, and is clearly and well presented.
Please consider to release the lecture slides to all courses.
Some of the material was too abstract and was somewhat difficult to relate to.
Very useful the second part of the course, about editing.
The course says it's for beginners to programming but I beg to differ.
Definitely improved from the first course of this specification.
I really enjoyed the rhythm in the first course but, this course left me lost more times than not.
All those questions I do not have an answer for after this course, which feels a bit short for me.
Course is very basic , although contents are compact and informative.
If they are there somewhere then i think the course as a whole would be improved by making them more apparent.
Okay, I'm going to go relax, now, to recover from this trying experience....
I think the course is worth taking but I do wish the material and assignments were packaged better - more aligned.
This would make it very obvious how the formulas were being constructed.
While I appreciate the logic behind this class, the content seemed very subjective and loose compared ot the class prior.
This was a decent overview of FP principals, but a poor introduction to the Scala language.
Too basic and too easy but helpful content
If you do know something about it, look for a different course.
I learned the most from lesson 5 and 6 about recommenders and deep learning because I knew nothing about these subjects.
The programming exercises are disappointing: just cut and paste.
But I feel the Professor's explanation is monotonic and uses more of textual definitions rather than simple explanations which are required for starters.
Ian Harris does it well and knows the content well enough.
Most of this content however is given sufficiently in the pamphlet with the Arduino Uno Starter Kit.
It's too advanced for a beginner to Ruby and web development but I feel it would be to slow if you read the tutorials and recommended books.
When first module and tests are very easy and guide well, but the pace rushes at the end.
There's a lot of parts when "we'll se this later" is mentioned, which means that maybe the examples are not appropiate for the pace of the course.
The little exams and practices are way too easy compared to the week's qualified test.
Lecturer is downright boring and not engaging.
Could had used more real-world companies as examples for teaching, including pictures, but it's the same bland slides again and again.
Examples (and assignments) use a commercial Dato product called (GraphLab Create).
I really hope the future classes in the Specialization aren't designed in the same way.
but some concepts are hard to understand for newbies.
There's a good chance to fail your final project because of technical issues.
Very basic level, nice talks though
So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.
But it was very informative overall
I understand that creating such a course is a tremendous amount of work.
It might be more productive to scale this content more gently by dividing it into a two-part course?
financial terms, different investment vehicles, etc.)
I have learnt some basic knowledge about dog's congnition.
I wonder if there were any TA's present in this run.
She's also a great example of a person with autism who has developed her strengths and worked around her weaknesses and is a highly functional and successful individual.
I will do the second part, but I will do a free version.
I think to someone with no experience would get pretty lost pretty quickly in this course.
content is not enough for one class.
I also didn't like the way index 0 and 1 is mixed in different lectures.
I think Judy Bloom is a brilliant writer.
Good course overall but assignments have too little guidance in how they should be completed and can its easier to use material from future lessons to solve the problems
The slides are determinant to improve and master (to some extent) the materials covered.
ok course.
Very well done (3 stars so I know I have completed the lectures but not the work, will change after completing assignments)
videos are too formal, professor not funny and less relaxed than during the first two modules of this specialization
Each video can be down in half the time
Nice course with troublesome assignments.
This was worth a -1 star penalty.
UPDATE: not being able to submit quizzes is a "feature" of the new Coursera platform.
The information in this course was valuable, but the assignments were poorly integrated with the course.
Very light workload if you're technically competent.
as a single example.
The second reservation is with the instructor's manner.
The problem starts when you begin the peer-assignment grading and realize the grading points are painfully specific.
A lot of slide and code typos were distracting though and it felt like the instructor was talking less to me (and more reading from a hidden screen), which dampened the overall experience a bit.
I was expecting something more in depth for methods and functions on swift
There wasn't enough practical or real world examples to practice with.
I wouldn't pay for the certificate - if I were an employer I would not recognize this course as teaching any sort of proficiency.
I consider the assignment is not very useful.
Hope that the rest of the specialization is worthwhile
I would prefer the lecture command line notes too in presentations or any other files in each week modules.
The contents of the course are interesting, but it feels too short, and the assignments trend to let you down (the scoring system is sometimes a bit brainless)
Could have more analytics or additional or optional problem sets to explore more deeply.
Very interesting and I'm sure it will be very useful for me.
Also have too much questions on the quizzes.
You can also practice using Excel if you have never used it before.
Maybe I suppose to master this tools too long in advance.
It's easy to pass the course, but it's hard to master its content.
The instructions for using git and git hub left a lot to be desired.
While the information is certainly good, and I enjoyed listening to David Hill, it is too basic for me.
It results in loosing the eye contact.
The exercises are too easy and boring.
Despite the material being interesting the instructor's way of teaching it made it boring and hard to pay attention
However, I still do not fully understand the statistics aspect.
Loving It!
It was great overall but my review reflects the sentiment that I felt like they could've added more topics.
It is a really interesting course, it refers to the general public, with smart tips and quick recipies.
is it efficient enough?
Waste of time for those who already know it are not interested in and just want to learn C++.
When there is cost function determining or demand in certain industry dependent on market structure.
A bit boring, but still informative.
I enjoyed the class very much and I loved the challenge of figuring out how to complete the assignments.
More practice and solved questions were required.
Kind of dragged on, but I think it'll ultimately be helpful in the specialization.
A example of the Capstone quiz, could made this course best.
Some of Robert Shiller's ideas were unclear or lost as he was not the best communicator but his passion for finance was evident.
Quizzes are currently reworked and bugs fixed and the team is very responsive.
It still was a good learning experience and doing Design sprints is a great approach.
If you are a prospective student wondering if you should take the course as a standalone course, I don't think I could recommend it, because there are far better ways to learn.
If you are not a professional programer, you will spend at least 30-40 hours a weak instead of 6-10 hours.5 week’s task is just a pure joke: 30 minutes explanation about most difficult structure in the course and not a single line of code.. After that you must write it by yourself.
Great introduction to the Subject
elementary .. good.
Good Course, but in my perspective the teachers could explain better.
I have seen the idea of using a semicolon followed by a transition word taught before, but I do not think I have ever seen it done in published writing in my entire life.
Some interesting ideas but not entirely convinced by the concept of 'humility' in this context.
As someone who isn't from math background many of concepts thought in here weren't quiet clear or intuitive.
Good High Level understanding of Analytics
It is a good course for beginners in Python language.
Really enjoyed the information and perspective from the course.
Good course, but too much data for the modules to fully grasp without a background.
If you are that person, this course is perfect.
Week 4 is very bad!Bad quality of video.
Bad speaker.
Good start with Fundamentals.
These things could be cleaned up a bit and the course would be more polished.
I like the materials, but I don't like that you need to pay to take the quizzes.
It seems like they are just trying to make sure you watched/read the content and understood it, rather than making sure you acquired the knowledge.
I was glad to get exposure to famous algorithms through this class, but I don't feel like I really developed an intuition for reasoning about their runtime.
Previous courses in this series was better.
I learned new things....
But.....
Would have liked to be able to discuss work-in-progress code more, but understand that it's tough to manage cheating in an online course.
The course is clear and goes at a sustained but correct pace.
Calling this a course is a stretch.
It would even be a stretch to call it a workshop.
Some of the videos are pretty unrehearsed.
The information was easy to absorb.
Please do not suggest the Community Forum.
HopefullyMary W
Only for beginners in time management who know nothing about time-saving techniques.
I managed to commit the material presented to short term memory so that I could pass the course, but as always happens when someone crams, the information is gone from my head.
A decent course, perhaps not as interesting as the previous one.
Its a Difficult one.
I would like to see assignments where you must practice what is learned in the lecture.
Unfortunately this course doesn't give this answer.
many subjects are not clear enough.
it is better to put links and pictures than send us to look in lectures for a specific time frame.
and still it was very interesting and motivating course.
Week 4 involves string manipulation, regular expressions and working with the Dates.
He goes on and on about how fantastic it is how we can all participate in scientific research, but if I am SUPPLYING DATA, why do I have to pay for that privilege!?
Extemporaneous examples were unintentionally and unnecessarily muddled.
Was expecting more.
It's also a fairly easy course to complete (you don't even need half a day).
Neo4j is very interesting but it is poorly explained.
Did not like that I have to upgrade just to take a quiz
I am not sure that I can confidently say that I can build a ML model now.
While this course is interesting and informative, I was hoping that there would be a larger portion dedicated to jobs, industries, and ideas that help make the world a better place.
Good course that does what it is supposed to do.
Feedback is useless, but content is fine.
R Programming is seeming difficult more hour courses are required to be initiated for making this language better learn among scientific community.
Good illustrations.
As someone who's always been interested in Ancient Egypt, I already knew some things and ended up being able to pass the tests with 90-100% without even following the course.
In my case, I am an intermediate learner, so it was not enough.
Not well explained....
It fulls of conversation with the same setting.
There was interesting information in the class, but the peer review questions were not well developed to stimulate thought and new ideas.
It provides me with exercises to practice but some of the videos explain things awfully or just not at all.
I am not sure it's the best teaching tool for this course.
Online video is OK.
It is very very basic...
Course contents are fine.
Unfortunately the absence of a course board where students can discuss and eventually receive help from the teacher has an bad influence on the course overall rating
this course is very useful if you want to learn about something that majority of people(not including me) don't care about, and is based on out-dated info and opinions of a high middle class, house mom.
His ‘academic speak’ obfuscates meaning rather than making it accessible.
There are a few incorrect lecture links and errors on tests that have been pointed out dozens of times over several years now and nothing has been done whatsoever.
Although the course is ostensibly on the blues it also covers a lot of material relevant to Jazz.
Pedagogically there were some problems.
I think the course has way too much material and could be split into 2 parts each part maybe a bit slower.
The presenter need to sharpen up his game a little as regards presentation skills, reading material of an IPad is not very inspiring.
Very basic course
I'd say 6 hours; easily more than that for the last assignment.
Also, no slides or related handouts are provided.
The course was useful, but the quizzes were frustrating.
a good one for gaining more knowledge regarding managing people
Good course for someone seeking to know fundamentals of Digital Marketing.
Either way, thank you for this opportunity!
It seems that rather than presenting facts as they are, the course is disseminating material deeply influenced by a religious agenda.
Thanks Dr. Chuck :)Cheers!
It was a good course.
Pop-ups w text showed up but disappeared before I was able to finish reading them.
The topic was so intersting but the content was not enought practical!
Interesting course, but far too short.
This course is good, but I feel it's too difficult.
I found this single class less challenging and interesting than the full specialization on Game Design from CalArts although it allows you to have another view of the process of Game Design in a more engineering way (e.
g.
The first three weeks focussed heavily on ratios and detecting fraud and earnings management in an organization, the fourth week seemed to actually relate to data analytics and how non-financial aspects of a company play a role in the financial outcomes.
While the course does a good job of explaining most things but if you struggle with a problem or a topic support is nearly non existent and offline resources for julia are limited.
Really just an overview of the topics to be explained in detail afterwards.
Big plus for the use of python + notebooks but otherwise, if one is interested just in the overview and not in all the specialization, maybe the Andrew NG course is more detailed.
Dislike how it chops and changes instructors in the same course.
We should focus on application based learning not on lectures.
)Have I noted the course is FREE?
A shorter version of the course that digs in a little deeper somehow might be more alluring.
Thank
Assignments should be free for everyone to try and be peer reviewed!
Very basic overview of the Arduino system.
And from the forum it seems like a lot of people spend 40 or more hours on this one last problem.
Need to me more technical.
The content could have been more engaging.
Walks you step by step, but a little too slow and detailed for someone with minimal coding background.
Missed opportunity: to combine the best aspects from each.
Not that the content is too easy, but the talking ... pace ... is ... hum... very ... ... slow.
I would see this being most useful to a person who had only vague ideas of what entrepreneurship entailed overall.
Without it I have no idea what went wrong.
It's more helpful to review different spreadsheet layouts to familiarize how variables are organized.
I didn't pay to listen to something that forces me to Google search everything.
assignments could have been a little tougher with more emphasis on coding.
I would rather have my work marked by people who have read the question properly.
I was expecting a lot more detail on ***how*** to perform data driven decision making.
It deals with two-speed IT in a single short lecture, so of course the treatment is superficial.
Teacher awesome.
But the course needs, in order to be better, more practical activities and i got a little bit upset when I worked hard in final project and later I saw that it´s not necessary at all.....
Instead, I should just did a final quiz.
But it was quite informative nontheless.
I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the specialization's courses, but I didn't think this one was quite up to the same caliber.
Wish there will be some lab assignments, for example doing some real work on AWS.
There is a very good lecture from an external speaker,which was very good and funny (at least i found it funny) and i didn't realise that it was 30 mins long.
Good enough to open up mind of researcher
For example, I think the lecture about the Jeffreys prior skipped many things and I did not understand this concept very well.
Its a really great project but one needs to have studied mechanical and really advanced level physics to do this project.
Dependence on GraphLab technology is a big minus.
For instance in FrontEnd JavaScript Framework Overview video, it is better in terms of organization and aesthetic to show library vs. framework in table form.
Also, the volume of Introduction to AngularJS video is too loud.
However, the programming relates primarily to animations so is most appropriate for those interested in design, game design, etc.
A lot of it wasn't comprehensible.
Explanations is pretty well, but it is not so difficulty.
The vast majority of students clearly do not have English as a first language and for many writing an academic essay is really some way ahead of their current position.
It has few content, should been more complete.
It is not perfect (nothing is), but it is one of the best learning experiences I have ever had.
The course material and videos are very good, however I would prefer that comments about your work be emailed directly to the student so that they are more likely to read them.
There are so many good ways to engage with the learner and yet none of them have been employed here.
Course content is good, however instructions for the assignments are not complete.
homework assigments in matlab are way too painfulthinking about if i should add x0 = 1 or not, X or X', how to sum over i,j,k, that was ok in 2010 but in 2016 there are tools that will spare us such details
The course touched just the basics of game design principles.
They need to relook some of the topics and either more videos or add in some easier teaching methods.
Yes, things don't always change, but the face of analytics changes daily.
I am only now thinking of learning from the videos but have given up the hope of getting a specialization certificate.
The instructor in the first two session was still engaging, but starting in the third lesson the instructor is so boring and his voice makes me drowsy.
Will be better to have always or very often the slides in background.
Too simple.
Teresa is great!
Doesn't provide a strong enough base for R Programming.
The information is given very quickly during the lectures, so it may be not so useful for web development beginners (even regarding possible background in other areas of software development).
Very hard and confusing for the beginner
It's better than the first course of the series, but there is room for some more difficult assignments.
She sugarcoats every word, read it in a monotonous way, smiles a lot.
The Deep Learning part needs to be improved
What's the point in paying for 'subjectivity' or 'having to adapt my answers to suit the course'.
Rating on a 1-5 scale for about 10 questions clearly showed central tendency problems, as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews.
I found the video lectures less helpful with this course (than the quantitative course) and resorted to reading the transcripts in order to learn the important information.
Very good audio and video quality.
No thinking required.
I'm only rating this course 3 stars because it's just too easy.
Good subject and good selection of documents.
I don't appreciate the "speaker" voice on the presentation, I rather like to see and hear the author.
Luckly I have not enrolled the certification.
Unfortunately, not being able to submit the assignments without paying a fee is rather offputting - Especially taking into account we're talking about peer-to-peer reviews
Way too basic.
I like the sense of Humor of Dr. Charles.
Learned some interesting principle.
She's quite knowledgeable and presents interesting material, however, she could benefit by animating her presentation style a little bit, so it doesn't sound like she's just reading it out loud.
Probability calculus and statistics are both enormous areas of mathematics.
Videos are very boring and useless in comparison to incredible content in the first 6 courses of the specialization.
I enjoyed this course very much.
The course is a decent level of basic plotting technique review, should be in more detail.
The problems are interesting, the course is great.
The instructor is fine but the lecture note is not really helpful.
I have 0 finance and accounting experience, so I valued how broad this course was and I imagine it's a good primer for more in-depth courses.
The course covered very interesting topics, but it would have preferred more detailed explanation of PD controllers and especially how to choose the tuning constants.
I am sure that MoMA team has the capacity to offer a deeper content.
Again, I felt like joining a class in the middle of the course.4) Writing some words big, some words small.
Which I think work well, but do mean more work than a lot of courses.
It is a good course.
It's a good course but not great.
no discussion forum and verified certificate, hence the 3 stars only.
I liked the readings.
So there is definitely much room for improvement.
Needs some fine tuning, but worth the time.
There is some good material but the presentation seems a bit uneven; some parts are repeated many times at very slow speed while other parts, equally important, barely rate a word.
The material is good and it makes me learn about the camera that I use and try new things.
Another did a good job of explaining one of my questions, but then all replies to my question ceased.
In general, the instructors seem to think it's a better learning experience to give the bare minimum in R, then have the student 'hack' their way to the answer using online forums, etc.
Wished the course was a deeper dive into this area.
Building a Data Science Team does indeed contain helpful recommendations for starting data science teammanagers/executives; for me it had a little too much of a Hu
Course and Assignments were good, but don't hope for an answer in the discussion forums.
It wasn't easy to understand the practices of software development in this course.
I dropped out for about a month (because of life priorities).
This course is helpful and I have learned quite a bit about punctuation and sentence structures.
However, while things like tense are important, to be able to differentiate 12 tenses contributes relatively little to typical academic writing.
I have been trying to follow Pollan's ideas for years.
Some were available online, but none were in our library system.
The best way to teach these models is to integrate them during finance or accounting, or whatever specific class you are trying to learn.
That said this is probably a good resource for someone with 0 and I mean absolutely NO experience with excel.
Good lectures and content but the guidance for the assignments are not particularly clear.
i feel i just learn the superficial knowlege
I passed every quiz doing the course across 3 sessions, yet I cannot speak a sentence in Korean apart from 'hello' and 'thank you'.
For example, I would add /more/ technical info at the video slides and also a /lot/ of literature related to IoT and embedded systems.
Pros:-Gives a brief overview of IoT ecosystem.
The course touches briefly on all the relevant concepts but it remains at a very introductory level.
I would recommend it only for student without any previous exposure to the subjects.
I had hoped to learn a bit more depth, rather than the few basic concepts actually covered.
I find many of them resonate with my experience leading to 1/5 stars.
One reviewer who gave 5/5 stars said they loved the course.
The course was pretty good.
It's presented at way too high of a level without enough tangible examples of getting down into the weeds of how to actually perform and interpret the models and functions.
I thought all of the information was great but at times the course was just very bland especially in terms of presentation.
So I wish we focused more on developing high fidelity work - in addition to the need-finding, user research, sketches, short weekly assignments.
Three stars for course structure, two stars less for every poor course material which doesn't contain any guidance to test questions.
Too high level compared to what I expected, but does give a good overview of the topic.
the information is very useful.
The course is a very good overall description of the Perception field.
The course was more of a "modern take on ancient questions".
very easy
Much of the lecture material seemed very chopped-up from previous courses and did not flow well at all.
I think this course is ok but is a limited version you need to spend a big time researching a lot about all the things to understand well the purpose and the final project.
I never saw the connection and they never explained it.
While this is a valuable skill, it doesn't seem the proper focus of a capstone course in a sequence focused primarily on other topics.
As noted elsewhere in these comments, there was a complete absence of any traditional teaching support.
I am already working in the field so it was elementary to me, but I feel it has laid a good foundation for the specialization.
Not because of my skill level, but the lack of clarity in the directions.
This course is understanding water and sanitation through the lens of economics.
What i did like about the course was that the material is organized but that doesnt help if you dont understand what is being taught.
I was disappointed in the short videos with subtitles.
It presents a lot of different aspect of macro economics in a really short time which is good.
Felt like it was a bit rushed and some of these concepts like Dijkstra definitely deserve a lot more attention.
Some of the classes are very basic knowledge.
The course only contains a basic introduction to chineese.
Helps me a lot understand how to organize knowledge and study better.
i liked a lot but im still to learning
Videos tended to be a bit longer than necessary.
Although quizzes were required throughout, I felt too much of the class was simply sitting back and watching lectures.
AWC setup instruction need to update according new AWC interface.
I recommend this course highly.
Compliments: The course introduced me to a number of reporting and research tools that I was not aware of.
Ok up to Module 3.
Enjoyed it though.
The course is well structured, and the contents are exposed clearly.
A business plan or a net value calculation would have been much more in the spirit of this specialization
The lecture on Hart Crane (module 1, lesson 4) was too difficult for me to follow in real-time spoken form, but then I found I could understand some of it by frequently stopping and starting the video, re-reading the lecture text in transcript, and taking long breaks for careful review of Crane's verse and for research about some of its allusions and associations.
Very interesting course, both tests and assignments aredemanding but fair.
Biggest problem of this course is that not all required topics are coveredenough in lectures.
it is just a blast of facts.
Prefer more references/examples shown in lectures.
A bit too short.
You can get many knowledge from this course, but you have to be prepared.
it gives an idea of how one is prepared to ingress to Data Science.
The course is interesting, the professors are good, they know how and what they have to explain.
Good Course, well paced, a bit too focused on Academic Institutions
Only explanations, it is very tiring to attend the classes.
A person with no knowledge of the subject matter should be able to score 100% in a maximum of 4 attempts at the quiz, just by trying each answer on each question.
The world is still at the centre of the universe to these academics!
In its current structure, the course represents a glance at an arbitrary selection of several topics (unrelated to e, existing in today's philosophy, rather than a coherent introduction into the broad discipline of philosophy.
I learned some important concepts, but all of the material was repeated many times.
If the slides were available, that would helped me to go further in my learning proccess.
The guest speakers, although high profile, were not the best choices, also because of issues with public speaking and generally getting ideas across.
Lectures were interesting and well put together, however the assignments and the knowledge required for the assignments were not covered in the lecture material.
The course touches only the basics so it is up the learner to explore and learn more about interested statistical tool.
Overall, I learned that the tricks somehow work, but my comprehension was not as deep as I can think about the extension or applications.
It often means a student is forced to search the internet and hope the answer they find is appropriate so they can write their own code.
I would prefer to learn about less SMM tools more in depth, rather then getting to know so many just briefly.
Lectures were too long and full of talking instead of pause questions to keep the learner involved rather than just listening.
The assignments were not very challenging nor were the lectures very in depth.
The problem is that the only feedback a student gets is from other students.
It was an interesting course.
The quizzes need strict computations based on a detailed knowledge, but usually the course does not prepare You for that.
I often had to pause and go back to study the material that was only briefly displayed.
It does give an overall concept of project management procedures and skills.
So, the narrative meets the 3 evaluation criteria: there is a narrative, it does address the research question, and it does correctly interpret the statistics.
This course's homework is somewhat irrelevant of the course content.
While the course name says "punctuation", it deals only with commas and to a small extent, with semicolons.
The regular exercises and the quizzes use different database system, and it sometimes hard to transfer what you learn to the quizzes.
The pre-quiz exercises are more helpful imo, but no answer key is provided.
Isn't it a wasteful computation to reconstruct the rating map?
The topics were not introduced clearly.
This course was a good introduction to the overall concepts.
I thought the videos could have been longer and more substancial, but the reading were great.
I kind of wish it had more examples of language to use in academic writing, contrasting good and bad examples.
Some of the quiz questions and final exam questions need some proofreading.
I also liked the use of a student in cooperation with the lecturer.- he set the scene well and was a good interviewer.
Too basic, if you're not completely unfamiliar to the subject.
But the course shows you how to create and manage your databases with Python in an efficient way.
Good Course for examining some English Grammar closelyThe course breaks down some aspects of English grammar and punctuation very nicely and has relevant practice exercises.
I wish the course covered a slightly wider variety of topics or went into slightly more depth of explanation.
I know this is Buddhism which is notoriously filled with concepts and long winded explanations but I think a lot of viewers could lose interest.
In my view, this course was nowhere near as good as the earlier courses by Prof Odersky.
There is little focus on the scholarly work in the field except perhaps the first few lectures.
However, the lessons were not presented creatively enough.
The material is clearly a cut & paste from a different (and I guess longer) course.
Interesting!
I really think this course could hel me a lot.
Let me also point out, that the 2 questions I posted are THE ONLY questions in the forums, so it's not as if the moderators would be overwhelmed by the amount of questions posted.
Learned quite a bit, but course was not as good as the first course of the specialization.
Especially the presentations in week 4 are rather messy.
Bugs in being able to submit the assignment were also frustrating.
Having almost completed this course, I can say that this course provides a basic over view of the concepts of ML.
It's a very basic introductory course.
I am a PhD student in genetics, so the background material there was review from undergrad courses.
The lectures were somehow chaotic.
Another course on Coursera `Mining Massive DataSets` is much better, in the depth and horizon.
Very very basic....
needed lots of outside referencing to complete.
The scripts are therfore nearly unreadable.
Lots of material in a short amount of time.
However, thank you for free access to the content
If someone is looking to understand the real basics of it, should take the Univeristy of Tokyo course.
I felt a little "in the dark" on some of this.
Very well conducted for a beginner, but some lectures seems too long to convey a simple concept.
If your background is not from one previously mentioned (or similar), this is a great, easy course that will help you learn in all areas of life and is worth taking, esp.
it could've given more instructions!
The course overall has good content.
A little heavy on the biology side
Not quite sure if it's even possible with this kind of material.
The lectures are amazing, but I wish we have a lot more involved homework than the short quizzes.
Good stuff.
The videos were not always easy to understand because of the unclear pronouncing of the key speaker.
It would be great if we could have at least one short paper graded by the professors themselves with a limit of words so it wouldn't take up too much of their time.
A raw case + hands-on quizzes would help frame/evaluate the capstone project, instead of having a dedicated Wharton personnel to grade presentations.
thats it!
Some ways to cultivate positive emotions on this course really help me a lot.
So far the topics are very interesting but the accent of the teacher is sooo difficult to follow and distracts me!
But a bit too slow and easy.
Not quite what I expected.
But I felt a lack of coverage of other graphic design of other cultures such as other countries where many ideas were born.
good in depth knowedge.
It's more towards teaching linguistics and theoretical concepts.
However it does not go deep enough into its topic.
Very informative but not very focused or streamline.
Videos and quizes are too long and too large
More dynamic talking heads could make this more watchable.
I would have liked this course to be longer, so that the information could have been spread out among more lectures, rather than so much information condensed into one week.
The videos are enjoyable.
This is not a beginner's course unless you already have previous programming experience.
The course was clear, I had difficulties to find course materials, especially examples were used in the video class, I wish they had been put in more obvious places.
I checked and rechecked the course videos, no mention at all of it.
Rather unacceptable for a peer-reviewed course, okay for a free, self-auditing run.
The content is already old and needs to be updated.
I know better now how to approach assessing a story and critiquing it, and I really want to work on a story of my own next!Not going to lie, though, this course was difficult to immerse myself in simply because of the examples: I'm not into guns, not into muscle, not into violence, and every single example was either of men, or how a female's mission centered around the men in her life.
I am not sure if anyone who has designed even a small game in Unity will be interested in this course.
Forums are only supported by fellow students and staff's involvement is next to zero in there.
a little dry and boring,but it's very useful
The course is well done anyway and worth a look.
Guest speakers invited to this course do share some valuable ideas.
Interesting course.
No good without the missing course and capstone projects
Good course but not enough new information and knowledge as expected
They should word their requirements properly so it does not create confusion.
Then, the videos kept getting unclear and outdated.
Homework is so easy
There is a slight lack of clarity in videos in terms of audio and also in terms of what exactly the author/lecturer is trying to convey.
The course is quite good and informative in the first two weeks covering a lot of information and a lot of exercises.
Week 3 is very unrelated and hard the videos and exercises are bad, and I had to do this part by myself again.
Also when we get to the final course project doesn't cover any of these techniques.
In my opinion, week 3 should be replaced with something more related to plotting systems and distributions, also one project would be enough.
Could be more in-depth (e.
g.
Kanban part...)
Neither it is a beginner course for game theory.
Can be completed in 1 week.
That makes a huge difference.
The course being concentrated exclusively on the design ideas of United States, it's quite literally "some ideas from the history of graphic design".
I'd give it 4/5 once it's all sorted.
Recommended if you can cope with the odd frustration.
But if you already have done some projects in IoT and Embedded systems and are familiar with what they are then you don't need this course.
The examples are getting very abstract.
A lot of outdated information.
I gave only three stars because much of the course content is outdated by over 5 years and in some cases over 10 years!.
In addition to that, I feel the course could use the following adjustments to make it better:1 - Have Python students grade other Python students and SAS students grade other SAS students.
On one hand, scope is ambitious and getting to attend a course by G Hinton is a luxury.
A bit boring – way too basic.
Also I found the questions for the programming assignments convoluted and not very helpful in describing what is required from the student.
The content was inconsistently delivered and the topics disorganized.
I didn't feel the course, overall, offered the same level of content and knowledge that the Craft of Plot offered.
I hope the reason for this is because the course was introductory.
This was a very wordy course.
I look at error log and realize there is some issue with versions.
I think this might be a difficult course to start with, although the quizes themselves are very easy.
Neither from fellow students, nor from the course moderators.
The discussion board and mentors are really good resources and can provide pointers to move along.
Materials in class are not suficient to understand the subject.
But the most disappointing point is for me the excessive simplicity of the assignments.
I appreciate the fact that this course doesn't go into the fine detail on how to code everything, I believe there is still more information on the coding and data management practices that could be included in the course content.
Maybe I missed something, but it fell a little short of the mark for me.
Course project is difficult for someone who have little idea about the steps in pipelines.
Of course that some concepts are needed in order to provide fundamental basis, but the main goal is and always will be how to interpret antibiograms and infere the most probable mechanism of resistance.
Gives just enough info.
I've missed at least one practical exercises on each module.
Overall is good.
separately instead of the huge videos with bullet points of the potentialities.
The course had too much stuff crunched (and poorly explained) in too short a time period.
it gives you the necessary tools and knowledge for just beginning the data mining course.
Many useful techniques and perspectives in this course!Take this course if: you are looking to learn new techniques to improve your time-efficiency and performance in learningDon't take this course if: you are put off by pseudoscientific assertions (an explanation based on the insula being the "fear center of the brain" comes to mind) or interspersion of useful information by neurobiological theories that have no relevance for improving your learning performance
I think a longer course where these statements and papers could be properly discussed and explained would easily be a 5-star rating.
Case-study example is helpful and contrary to the most comments I do appreciate the final course project: this how most problems are stated in real life.
The submissions I reviewed were all over the board and none came close to the grading rubric
The digital world changes dramatically fast and the course must follow it.
The professors are good but the way how they present the course is extremely inefficient.
Sometimes you can get it done without actually understanding what is going on.
There are no things like nouns in english most of the times, so why?
Although topics such as Signal and FRP are interesting they serve little value in day to day use and assignments focusing on Futures would be far more beneficial.
The fundamental notions of Philosophy should be available for learners, as well as the great Philosophers from Ancient Greece to the Twentieth Century.
From the mathematical side, the course is also rather shallow.
Finally there are no peer reviews and all quizzes are theoretical - rather disappointing.
Last week's content was thrown together from various bits & parts from the Functional Reactive Programming in Scala (or whatever the name of the predecessor of this course was).
Overall, I felt that there was a lot of ground covered in a short amount of time - the course would have been better if it was longer, and week 4 material would have benefitted from being stretched into two or three weeks.
I was extremely disappointed that after laboring through 3 long stories, only one formatted in the way the course specified, and trying to write at least one page of comments on each that what I got in return was on good critique and two that were only two lines long.
This course is too easy and more like a user manual, I wish there are more "Why" or "principles" inside.
This course does not build a lot on my formal knowledge.
All very good and knowledgeable.
too easy.
This could've been better, but i understand that you want to minimize time of videos, but at the end it lacks many information about delegates and protocols and so on
The methodology is worth understanding, for sure.3.
The hints after the quizz questions were solving the questions and avoiding the beautiful part of the quizzes: playing with the formulae, and interiorizing it.
All in all it was a nice, enjoyable course, but sadly I feel I didn't get deep enough in many of the treated subjects, even for an introductory course.
It was pretty intuitive and easy to follow the first couple of weeks, but then the assumed knowledge of beta and gamma distributions and their frequentist usage, stood in the way of me fully grasping the Bayesian part of it.
A little boring.
The book is better in my opinion.
Seemed more introductory, here are the tools - go have fun rather than actually teaching teaching
very repetitive with previous courses (especially week on competitive advantage), otherwise many concepts uses in a different way with different terms.
This helps the learner grasp the concept betterSecond, The explanation can be a little clearer - especially the topic of polymerization.
Grading metrics are unclear because assessment of assignments are only peer grading.
It is best to take this course after some stints with Data Camp, Swirl, or Code School.
Simple and Easy way to learn English
Also, the course admin might consider explaining 'On' 'And' 'Where' 'TIMESTAMP', 'DateDiff' more than what was provided.
Quiz is much harder than material on video.
I'd like to give more stars but am being generous with 3 stars.
And aiding student who can't afford the price by grants is relly nice.
It gives you what you need to know.
It feels like the course should be at least 50% longer as in that exam you are literally trying to stitch ideas together into educated guesses (i got 80% plus on all of the course work).
Instructor was only reading the slides.
I feel it's too simple and really just for beginners who know nothing about coding
Doesn't add specific value to your skill set!
The material may be nore specific
I think that I would like to be more concrete on topics, the teacher explain very well but then there is not that amount of concrete examples, so the classes gets very theorical,
No contact information.7) Books: Missed suggestions of books in the hotel industry.
Anyway, these are only observed points in order to contribute to development of course.
I may have gotten more out of this course if I hadn't already read "The Genius of Dogs".
I would like to suggest that the slides be subjected to more rigorous proofreading, as I came across several typographical errors.
Good course content but it can be very difficult to get help if you are stuck on something.
Not such a great course.
Having said that, I believe it should be optional in the specialization.
While informative I question the value of memorizing release years of os updates.
No any clear logics.
Besides, some interviews would be nice.
Everything was reduced to filling in 1 or two lines in a bigger function.
Hope that the following section will be better.
Nice course but didn't include enough python code for other database vendors and wasn't challenging enough
after the second week I droped this course...
I thought it will include excel and economics knowledge but was very wrong..
thanks!
Well done on that!
I would have liked to had more relevant examples of how to apply the concepts learned to real life scenarios.
In my point of view, a very long time was spent to learn how to draw something in the screen.
I was able to grasp the overview of the course.
Would have loved to see some concepts explored more in depth
I had to check how a pinball machine works.
Good for real beginner of programming, if you already have experience with any other language, this might be too easy
Very elementary introduction of key concepts.
This course was okay at best.
Also while some of the quiz answers are obvious from watching the lessons, some are totally not and if someone doesn't have ANY programming experience I think they would find some questions almost impossible to answer.
Not as good as the former three in the Specialization.
Not all the lectures are translated.
So basic Tableau explanations
I wasn't sure what to expect with the Advanced Writing course.
If I'd understood this, I may well not have enrolled.2.
A bit disappointing from an institution like Wharton.
The content could be 50% theory and 50% practice which i consider that it was more theoretical.
Compared to the first course in the specialization, Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling, which was absolutely great.
What I liked:Good info on the tools in excel that are needed.
What I didn't like:Time spent on content that necessarily wasn't regarding models; the critical material was buried in videos and was very brief.
The course is well structured and focused on the front-end as is the idea of the whole web design track.
It is on a very basic level as far as the neuroscience and level of material and for that reason it was not super useful to me.
In addition, programs used in the course are pretty confusing (If you know 0 Java).
I wish it could be more challenging and that it could offer me more opportunities do practice.
The most disturbing thing about them is that, on some occasions, concepts are used in the quiz questions (either directly in the questions and answer choices, or indirectly in the "correction" for the quiz after you have submitted it) that were never touched upon in the course.
I have had two occasions of concepts not introduced in the course but used in the graded assignments.
The first occurrence of a gap between course content and quiz questions was on a quiz question about inference.
Course contents are rather deep which is good and makes it challenging.
Not a lot of information for someone who wishes to learn about organic/holistic dairy management.
Good information but way too short for what Coursera charges.
On the whole a great resource to the student community who want to start their microcontroller exploration through Arduino.
very interesting environment to learn the subject.
Perhaps, only have each person do two reviews instead of three but have them submitted as part of the next week's assignment and rated.
I knew nothing about Jefferson before this course and nothing about his 'age' - not sure I am much the wiser about the latter after it!
In my case were not quite useful, without almost no analysis and without understanding the meaning of the assignment in itself.
Needs to be updated.
I believe it's a must for anyone in AI/ML or Statistical Inference.
The course is not that much helpful for those who want to do work for coding.
But after having completed the first course of the specialization, I have radically changed my mind, and will look for alternatives "elsewhere" to get the knowledge/skillset that I am after.
Java 7 instead of Java 8 makes things too verbose.
The course has incredible content, but you are required to read quite a bit of information via lengthy pdfs prior to the videos.
However, I must say that I expected the course to be more thorough in the discussion of the different themes and artworks.
Also, there should be more exercises to practice.
It provides a quich shot on data science, but the way it presents is not so interesting.
interesting topic, but teaching is not so attractive.
I wish there were practical recommendations on salary negotiation.
Subtitles are also out of sync.
Overall, good for newbies into management and a nice little refresher.
Sometimes he did something not clear and there was no answer what is happening and why in this way.
RIGHT NOW I AM HEADING TOWARDS END OF THE COURSE.
it would have been great if the final assignment had been grade
The history and story of emergence of internet is described.
Very interesting topic, but even for an introductory course not nearly enough to justify a full 4 week course for € 71!The first course, Fundamentals of Graphic Design, had more content, more (optional) assignments, and covered Typography, too.
I gave 3 stars because the videos are very good and good concepts but I paid far more money than they now charge.
More visuals of the sites, tools, and ideas would have been better.
Content is generally easy to follow.
I guess there is a small mistake on the camera positioning.
A lot of my time got wasted since it is very difficult to figure out the syntax/structure of the language from the very skimpy lectures &/or the very technical Apple documentation.
Also, not ONCE did the instructors participate or respond to the forum discussion so it was not a surprise that the forum was barely used at all.
I am stuck with soldiering on with the next 2 modules since I pre-paid for the specialisation but really I am very disappointed with what I am getting for a paid course.
If there was anything I wish went into more detail, there would be two things.1) Yo / Yeoman: This part of the course was more of an "Obligatory" lecture, just to say it's mentioned.
Easier than expected.
The real basics of data analysis.
Rather than suffer through the lectures, I did DataCamp's Intro.
The quiz questions were unclear and generally poorly written, and didn't make me think enough.
Good videos but strucural info and help.
In my opinion, it gets too technical and it is not a self contained course at all.
But No farther guidance to how to think in Scala way.
This course got better as it went on.
Examples are a bit too contrived.
A nice course about the MAPS approach and the typical difficulties of natural scientists and mechanical engineers when approaching the political arena and dialoguing with stakeholders.
Good for a basic level but I expected more in this course.
The course itself is excellent [5] but the "money grab, you must pay attitude" is horrible [0].
Simple and fast.
Try to put more difficulty on the quizzes.
As an organizational development practitioners, I found it very academic relative to the terms used and examples given.
So I guess we're all stuck with this one.
The final peer-assessed assignment is lacking in instructions or guidance.
very basic
At some points it goes very deep, for example with the vectors for a document, but with the rest stay at a very high level.
It made the exams a little confusing.
Also, I don't have subscriptions to the various tools but it might be useful for future reference.
-- and seeing that I was for all intents and purposes on my own.
I've done some amazing courses on Python also offered from Uni.
But, I do understand that the course is more suited for people without prior experience in programming, so I have nothing to complain about.
Given we have video lectures, concepts could have been explained better by demonstrating on the R console instead of showing static slides and verbal explanation.
Some good information in the video lectures, but very heavy handed on the delivery.
The course information was great and the assignments were very helpful.
The final project is the real challenge, the course lectures are just and introduction and you learn the hard way with the project.
Not bad for refreshing your memory, as in my case - I already received the information while studied in academy, and new key principles but overall memory was shady and needed to be refreshed.
The course content is far to academic and I would get far more from a book.
The lessons are disjointed, taken out of context, and some of the examples are using the wrong version of Python and missing parentheses.
It's nice course but a little bit boring.
I think the quizzes could've been higher quality.
The subject matter is very interesting, the reading material is well-chosen, but the video lectures are superficial, to put it mildly.
This is especially true when the user is forbidden from looking at the actual testing code.
what needs to be memorized and what just needs to be understood .
Hoping that the next sections won't be so laborious and focussed on analyzing texts in detail.
The other thing that would help immensely is having TAs in the course.
I can't review about the full course (but you should pay for it).
The most obvious issue with the course, is that peer revision takes a very long time, which means that you will get overdue assignments no matter what.
That example, extended, could be a good capstone project, but I think it was not appropriate as a course assignment.
Need to explain more topics
They are simply replays of old videos and people are not inspired to participate in the forums.
really basic info
Interesting, but the assignments were a bit dull.
MiniZinc docs are quite minimal, so supporting material would be helpful.
Several papers for the course are behind pay walls.
This has been a wonderful course.
A reference book from 2001 is very out of date, especially in the software world.
Fair but assignments are not very well explained
Somewhat messy code.
Eventually, they'll start to make sense :-)
The Python lessons are just samples taken from a completely different curriculum on Codecademy and poorly integrated into the bio-centric course content.
Submerge more in some topics and explain it.
Maybe I am expecting too much from an online learning platform?
As a capstone to a series of courses that covered data science and R, I found this one to be a bit lacking.
When implementing the language model (which, at first, I thought was supposed to be KBO), I got stuck for a long period.
Not the fault of teachers or institute, i think the only mistake they made is try to fit too many topics in one course.
Useful if you want to take PMP exam, beginner info about PM, but not very deep.
Enjoyed the professor, but there was lots of fluff and ultimately spent far too much time focusing on legalities and minor details and less on actually imparting negotiating skills.
But overall this course requires some significant effort to explore the material from an external perspective.
Some issues however -1.
Even though he takes a while to warm up, he's really good at showing the big picture connections of why things happened.
Hope the rest of the course will flesh out in more detail the various topics.
The course is really interesting, but I believe the professor approach to describe and explain the topics is really confusing.
I added the third star just for the book which is good on its own.
This course was more diverse than I thought it would be and I really enjoyed it, however I thought the end of year project could have provided more differentiated prep material as that confused me.
The other systems course (Systems Science and Obesity) seemed to balance these aspects much better - and moved the technical aspects to labs.
I did like the course BUT when you make the "exercises" and post something on the forums... OMG...
The presentation is not consistent: there are slides, web cam videos, animations, and it just feels like the course is a mish mash.
I assume it as direct manipulation and do not like it at all.
Overall good experience though
repeat of the same material and content in multiple videos, the videos were sourced from too many different places leading to 1) decrease of consistent quality and 2) non sequential / logical teaching (each video does not clearly lead to or build on the next one)
Please use real world PM uses, not going to work..
Show examples of project management that went horribly wrong..
lots of those examples as well.
Also, Craig has an awesome personality: super high energy, very eager to engage; this makes me wonder the extent to which one's personality determines the effectiveness of the selling process.
Maybe what is missing a swirl exercises, not using caret.
I enjoyed this course but I was not satisfied with the assessment.
The content kept me engaged and highly motivated.
The content is good and easy to follow but lack depth.
What to say about this course?
But in the end I feel that this specialization is not focused enough on developing portfolio pieces.
Several errors in lecture and lack-luster assignments decreased my perception of value.
Instead, the course focused more on using functional principles when implementing computations.
I feel that instructor could have gone a little deeper into the subject matter.
However, I liked the laid back instruction style.
However, the course take the long way to explain very basic elements of nations interactions and trust.
I just skipped all videos with Parham Aarabi.
in the course and have the lectures tie in closer with the content of the quizzes.
Interesting material, but wasn't necessarily of the same depth of knowledge like previous courses in the series
The level of the exercises and quizzes don't reflect the content of the course.
It not only equips one with financial knowledge for the corporate world but on a personal level.
Could have at least a voice, some interaction!And is too expensive.
The course has some valuable information, however course materials and videos are not so helpful.
Very interesting topic and good presentation.
Delivery was good.
The instructions are clear, but the way to go about completing the assignment was not.
Although the lecturers tried not to favor one brand over another, at times it seemed like we were watching an infomercial.
However, I have seen similar opinions from people like me.
Not even to solve the assignments without example codes.
Would be nice to have a more open community.
The course content was wonderful.
not too many new things about Python.
I think the course needs to be restructured in order to be more practical and in order to go more deeply into theoretical material.
Also there is slightly contradicting instructions between the task and review description.
I am very disappointed with this course.
While this course, tackled the core problems in dealing with intercultural communication, the videos and case studies were confusing to me.
Include more material to read.
Lots of good material, though I don't like how they've repackaged the original material from the prior longer version, which I worked through at my own pace a year ago, off session.
The quizzes are also quite useful, as you're required to know both the background of how things work and use the commands learned from the lecture.
CONS: The assignments assume you know a lot more than the basic knowledge, and there's no real way to know how to do the assignments just from the lectures.
I had a hard time sustaining interest in the course and did not finish.
But the stuff they teach is surely great and makes you appreciate the beauty of R
highly recommended for newbs in any kind of development, otherwise waste of time.
In final exam results they say 3,8 is 45% of 15,3 ¿?...
They could have discussed both these topics properly by investing more time.
It was very good to learn terrorism from the theory angle and believe the two groups should work closer.
The course notes were either excerpts from R.
Peng's books /blogs (good) or automated transcripts (complete with typical AI typos... "wait" instead of "weight").
I´ve missed Chinese hanzi.
But apart from that the course and tests are all good.
The course is fast paced and the videos do not cover all of what is necessary to know to pass the assignments.
Great introductory course, however, there are some anti-patterns taught (e.
g.
Better than the first, but it looks like each element was created in a single day.
Opening the quizes and the internal acreditation for free should be a most for such a good course like this.
Its a shame that "non premium" users have access to only the video material.
So I kind of listening him while trying to read what is happening on the screen.
Good and necessary introduction to Python.
The course shall ask comments on the forum like the other courses do.
It is a very simple course.
It may be suitable for people with incipient engineering knowledge but for the slightly trained a bit repetitive.
I got confused on one of the assignments in which the questions of the given chapter were supposed to be answer.
For instance, throughout the course we are considering housing pricing from the plain gradient descent algorithm to much more complicated issues.
So far, topics are too theoretical.
In the first week the readings were overwhelming and I was disappointed - but the other 5 weeks had short videos of interviews with photographers to go along with the concepts presented.
Also the quizes should show the correct answers once you completed them, if not you cant figure out why the questions are wrong.
This was a decent course.
Not formal enough.
Expect some difficulty if you use other tools like pandas - the programming assignment completely assumes you use SFrame.
What a shame!
It's a good course.
It would be great if tutors can add practical examples to show how marketing analytics is actually performed it would have been great.
The first project required a lot of work, while the last week had no project at all.
Minor errors in videos and programming assignments.
Thank you for the course.
With all my respect to authors, I have something to say:I beleave all 4 cources in the spesialization could be combine to one.
I'd recommend this course be taken as audit.
For me reading is a very good Addition to the Videos so that you can slowly think about the thoughts and arguments.
It´s a very good course, but when we get to the part of really generating the app, I had a lot of problems that were not covered in the course.
However the bad things are: the deadlines are way too strict; the lectures are way too long and seem to have an unclear structure; technical problems are frequent; a lot of stuff remains poorly explained.
Interesting, but a little bit too easy and shallow.
The material was reused from other courses without making it all fit together well.
Some subjects was not entirely connected between weeks.
That time could rather be used to go into more depth with some of the practices.

I already have python on my computer, but the course basically only explains ipython notebook.2) (Negative) I think the course would be a lot better if it didn't use this pretty graphical interface of ipython notebook.
There are some nice cooking tips, but this is targeted to very young students/parents with no cooking experience, and I expected more than general information on food impacts on children.
Def, for someone who has more javascript uner their belt.
It makes your concepts crystal clear.
I was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding Angular.
I would like to have seen more in-depth tasks or project(s) that would require deeper exercise of the topics covered in class.
Great class, however I felt it was very heavy on statistics and math concepts versus how to use Excel for data analysis.
I recomend it to know about how Latin America is working at this moment.
Then again, the difficulty was way too easy and the quiz questions should be tested for test wiseness.
I personally was looking for more advanced / in-depth information about nutritional science in order to better equip me to be a knowledgeable resource for my clients (with whom I primarily work around health / wellness related issues).
Some codes were added then removed then added again.
Unfortunately, often that is not good enough, to debug your code.
Lecture component not as concise or well edited as expected.
I would have enjoyed a course that delved into "harder things".
For someone who doesn't like as much "hard challenges" as I do, I do think that this course is a nice introduction to the subject.
May be its me, but, I guess, I might need more time to fully comprehend the materials.
This course requires a lot of reading of the Dato SFrame manual.
It is a very interesting course.
The tasks are achievable and easy to follow.
I do not understand how your final qualification depends on an activity qualified by fellow students, many of them, as the instructions read, are not fluent in English.
Capstone was great, although I would have learnt stuff better if there was a small battle from the deadlines and the curriculum in particular.
That would save time and perhaps open opportunities for more advanced material to be included.
At the first time it was a very usefull course in terms of knowing how we can improve life quality of this population in particular, but, at the end the course it turned into another perspective that for me does not met all the objectives previously exposed
Very short lectures and easy assignments, but a good overview and starting point for further studies.
mostly introduction to Python capabilities in databases/overall pretty good class.
Otherwise it's great material at a good pace.
Gets progressively tougher but loses momentum in the end.
JS should be more indepth.
There should be more than just lectures.
This class is very easy.
I think the Prof of this course would be super fun to drink with, too.
too easy,not fit me
The lesson is informative but the course professor does not share value on each slide.
However students have to deal with an autograder for the scores and the autograder is not up to par for this course.
Being reviewed by only three persons is too few.
But it was still good.
Final project really hard
I would highly recommend this for anyone who already knows basic Astronomy Math, and caution anyone who doesn't.
If you squeeze the content, you can probably get a couple of pages of notes out of it.
Having said that, it is somehow useful, if you don't already have a system in place that works for you.
The last module was very scattered and hard to follow.
You can learn this all on internet, but the instructor nicely covered 3 topics in 3 weeks, which is helpful.
Midway it looses connection with mathematical details in a way that it becomes too vague and does not empower the student to really grasp the concepts.
One that comes to mind is a question that had identical options for two of the multiple-choice answers, but only one of them was correct (50/50 guess, more or less --- I had to take the quiz 3 times before I guessed right!
Group assessments can be hit or miss given varied experiences of other students, but overall a good place to start
I find it rather vague, but it's alright.
The first week or so feels inconsistent and oversimplified.
Great teacher, but i was expecting more advanced content.
This Course is very standard.
But, the later exercises might be a bit hard for an absolute beginner.
Also, I wish there was a video about UICollectionView.
Too much code, too complex, too fast.
If you are a beginner, this course's assignments will be quite difficult to solve but not impossible.
This course is just showing the basic, not as complete as other online course platform where they show you how to insert video, contact form and audio.
It should be 5 stars based on content - though I have a feeling it's a bit dragged out to create as many courses as possible for the Speclialisation.
However, I think IPython isn't a great tool for this, especially as the requirement is Python 2.7 for GraphLab as it doesn't support Python 3 yet.
If you have had little hands on experience in Python, you may not find it that useful, though it's good to rehearse a bit.
The course was very informative in the areas it covered, Unfortunately it almost totally ignored the Israeli Arabs who make up about 20% of the population; perhaps it is normal to exclude them in Israel, but this is supposed to be an international course.
Python, but it's a lot of work, and not for the faint of heart.
I understand it was an overview but I often felt that it was very brief.
I felt that weeks 1-4 went at a reasonable pace, but the week 5 material was rushed.
However, about half the course focused too much on the software that could be used for systems analyses in public health.
As a negative point, I found lack of examples so that understand better the theoretical issues as well as to remember better.
The instructor's lecture sounded too robotic and I feel like he didn't make any effort to explain some of the principles or simplify the course to the audience.
Easy to understand, but I just cannot recall too much half a year after finished it!Maybe it is a little bit superficial.
I could not complete it as 100% because of a bug, in week 3 quiz and week 1 quiz.
I was slightly disappointed by the course: too much information was given and not always in a clear way.
Very few o no information about the Latin America
Terrific course!
The assignment must be graded by "peers" -- which means, if you happen to take this course at a time when no one else is taking it, you're out of luck.
Re: content, I would discourage you from taking this course if you don't speak fluent French.
Great lectures.
It's not so much about the Python language as about the things you can do with it on-line
Some of this may be review for you if you've taken the R programming course or the "R Programming Environment" course in the "Mastering Software Development in R" specialization.
The one thing I liked are course materials - for this I give 3 stars, not 2.
It's a good introduction to the world of Android development.
But the peer review grading "grid" as it currently stands is not "that" helpful in assessing whether the course contents has been assimilated.
To conclude, when I took the course, my initial plan was to follow the entire specialization.
tricky concepts and long equations yet fun
Well, given all the complaints, the instructor is of no doubt one of the best in this field.
It takes very long to understand.
Tasks are different in complexity, but time is given the same.
Speaker's constantly interrupts sentences.
Concepts are not explored very much.
The course gave a nice overview on strategy formulation but was in my view a bit inconsistent.
First week and last week were pretty useful with some good tips from the videos... the other weeks not so much.
I was expecting more from it.
feel that slides downloaded is not worth the time.
The course and the content was great, but the grading process was terrible.
This course would feel very basic to anyone who has studied sustainable development or sustainable business in any form.
The content, although very basic, is interesting, and some of the teacher's insights do stimulate discussion, but the video quality is low, with non matching slides, etc.
I believe it can and will be much better if the pool of students grows and there is more staff participation.
The course is nice, lectures is fine.
But assignments is a bullshit.
E.
g., on quiz #1, there was a question about "objective functions" which the instructor didn't explain until the last course module.
The other thing that I think would have helped me would have been less presenting and maybe a couple of quizzes for knowledge checks vs the pause and think items that were included.
They were of course related, but were implementing parts of a bitcoin node, but in a simplified manner.
I didn't like the main lecturer of the course.
This course on it's own doesn't give much.
However, the course has too much memorized stuff to remember (especially when students try to finish the tests).
This course goes on a very fast pace and simply does not have the charm of all the other courses in the specialization.
This is a good introduction course.
Need to include more student project design in the course
Some reference materials or write ups would be greatly helpful.2.
I like the enthusiasm of the instructor, but I think he short sells many of the things he is teaching.
Good basic overview.
I was happy with the week on making R packages.
Some videos are taught having the same problem like, for example, some tools/themes are presented without us knowing what they are for.
It's good till now.
It is a reasonable well-delivered course given the topic
From the review of assignments I can say that a few students seem to adapt better to the structure of the course that I did.
the course is not that strong when it comes to communicating with direct reports .
This was essentially a self-study project with some social peers.
I can almost speculate that there was an impulse to add in cartoon sproing-bonk-cuckoo-klaxon sound effects.
You can't work along because the website parse.
com do not accept new members....
Don't rush to purchase an apple developer account!
The quizzes should be corrected since some questions are ambiguous.
While they say you can choose one or the other, later lessons will only use one or the other (it switches) and this causes issues if you actually intend to follow along and learn something.
Great methodology, timing and very good teacher.
The course is fine, but I would give the certificate out for free and charge for the ones that follow in the specialization as an incentive to enroll.
It is very short to feel like a real class.
I would go with the former.
Slow down.
I believe this was a very good course for beginners.
Good introduction of working with tabular data in Pandas dataframes.
This high fidelity, digital work could even be optional, but I need some guidance on what work to develop and how the overall process should look.
Or even being allowed to enroll in the capstone before completing the first 7 sections would be helpful.
The BootStrap part could be better in my opinion.
Overall the course was easy to understand and follow.
I enjoyed the course overall, but the HR component/perspective was only somewhat useful.
I didn't feel like it was class room level engaging with the explanations.
I realized this is a one way MOOC, but I've taken courses off and on since they came out, and some others felt more interactive.
A good start for an inexperienced programmer, but too remedial for experienced programmers.
I understand being an intro course the content needs to ease people into the subjects however, more realistic and real-life examples are necessary to take the material from this course and apply it.
During this course I had many issues with bower and version conflicts.
Fair course.
We work hard and should not have our work plagiarized, but since it is peer review and not teacher graded, they get away with it.
Find that the recipes actually contain rather unhealthy ingredients (e.
g., always avoid butter--too unhealthy); and 3.
Nice introductory course but too much dependence on graphLab create
This course is good only to give an overview of supply chain logistics, but it does not give little deep to in depth knowledge.
The entire 7 week course should be condensed into the first week - a single one hour lesson.
Still, I appreciate the time and effort of the course staff and thank them for providing the course.
The code walkthroughs were rushed and I barely learned enough to scratch the surface of some of the scripts we used in the basic projects.
It is an interesting course, but mostly for beginners.
At least not yet!Anyway, I think is an overall good course for not initiated people like me
I would say this is a very, very high level look at game design.
It appears quite slow (compared to the likes of time tested databases).
There are some incorrect answers in quizes and some instructions for the ssigments are qiute unclear...
Useful.
As the first of ten courses, I understand that it is a very general introduction.
Good introduction, but just that an introduction.
I found it a bit too short and too simple.
Maybe give it more pop-up quiz to make it better
The course itself is easy to follow and informative.
need more material.. course is too simple
I've tried a few other MOOCs; they all granted students the week after the lecture to prepare for the assignment.
Non credit excersise are still very good at helping with understanding in practice what is going on.
The instructer is not fluid, a "mentor" is devoid of critical thinking in communicating through the discussions section, the peers are reviewing haphazardly while "mentors" offer their own essays (from the past?)
The scenes were often emotional, quite surprising such a short moment could be so charged.
However the main emphasis of this memory module was to explore malfunctioning memory, to the side of pathology.
Some quiz questions, with multiple choice options with only one correct answer, will not accept any answer.
Really too short.
Quizzes are useful exercises but need to do a lot of self studying.
The videos were a bit confusing and gave me the impression that it was a patchwork from old lectures.
Good overall but the content uses library and other content that make it hard to apply the technologies to the real world, an emphasis on orienting the content to 'from scratch development' would be duly appreciated I think.
The readings are too long and the content of the quiz sometimes gets you frustrated!
I am sure this says more about my inability than the teacher's ability.
I think the objectives and expectations could have been more clearly communicated and the statement themselves better thought out.
Very basic Course.
I would've liked to see some strategies on how to analyze large datasets, look for trends, and clean up bad data.
However, the tutorials and practice quizzes do not adequately prepare you for the actual graded Quiz at the end of each week that counts toward your final grade.
I would only recommend this course to someone with a serious personal management issue.
It was very challenging.
One of my reviewers had problems with his Xcode environment and couldn't run my submission.
However, I think this course might be hard if you never did any more advanced (high school) math.
Also it is recommended that you know Adobe Illustrator or InDesign.
4 weeks is too short, and this entails fragmentation of course materials.
I am also interested in war prior to 1500, esp.
However, the first three weeks seemed to lack focus.
PROSGreat explanations by the instructor.
ie: Africa and Asia.
Because not only does the student have to grasp the concept of loops, then also have to think about ascii print logic.
Wey easy for the person with some python experience but the best part is that takes only hours to complete all assignments and quizes
The second two weeks, when the Java Script is introduced, the projects suddenly become very hard.
The exercises are confusing.
Great course but need to be updated to Python 3.
x rules
Assignments are the best part of the course.
This course is a short introduction to JavaScript.
And also, I personally like to have a reference assignment that was completed by the instructors.
The 2 stars were removed because of the truly obnoxious plugging of the prof's own book and research project.
The main problem is too small community.
There are a number of useful guides for new researchers to learn how to structure, phrase, and approach academic writing.
It was WAY too easy for me, but my wife did it too and it was about right in difficulty for her.
Course content must be updated and more invovled tasks or discussions with Course makers.
Chunks of lectures appear missing, with things appearing on the blackboard between the video sequences and several "previously we talked about X" when X wasn't mentioned in the online course at all.
Disregarding that, it's still a useful and enlightening course.
Trying to cover many subjects and diving deep into less interesting areas.
The lectures themselves are very clear and easy to understand, accompanies with good decks.
The course is too some extent useful It indeed spreads useful techniques and concepts in learning.
Seemed like more of two week advertisement of the specialization and Agile, rather than a course.
You will find a matrix product such as A*B' only to go on and implement A'*B.
I learned a few things but the lack of musical analysis was a disappointment.
This course is too basic....
perhaps squeeze more material since it assumes you don't
The assignments, in my opinion, were beyond the scope of the lectures and supplemental assignments.
Anybody having done any course in statistic would have little to no information from the first two weeks.
However, the material is quite basic, and therefore not very challenging.
But the contents of week 4 and 5 are not even in the specialization!
Would have been more helpful if had actually taught how to break a problem in parts and then create a policy.
I think that some case studies that show how all of the concepts relate to one another, or how they are used in the bigger picture would be helpful.
Also, as a suggestion, I feel that if something is important enough to be included in the quiz, it merits more than the briefest of mentions in the lecture.
But, if you have good experience in CSS & JavaScript you might play it at 1.5X, it is too informative to be attended by someone who knows even a little, it might be boring, then.
Generally, the course is very informative, rich, instructions based and have very good exercises covering all the course content with a good-as-a-start hands on experience.
I didn't expect all that math and equations in a course about the brain.
Kind of... too basic?
The videos were a good start into the assignments, but I had to spend hours reading on the internet to really understand enough to complete the course.
I liked what I saw in the videos, just wish there was a little more substance.
3 stars for the missing pdf slides.
Without a functional bibliography for the course, the full potential for learning of those enroled is tragically cut.
I think that presentation slides should be offered to students.
Nevertheless, once you can successfully solve an exercise set, you can be sure that you have mastered the related concepts.
By the way, this course uses many custom libraries which actually help in writing interesting programs to solve real life problems.
The fund of F & B is very interesting and long follow it with interest.
Some of the videos made too long by unnecessary clips from hollywood which illustrate the point but are too long.
This course has great content and I believe the professor is very knowledgeable about this subject matter.
I also feel prepared for the future if I were to apply for a role on a dedicated data science team.
Please unlock solutions in advance of peer reviews so we can grade peer reviews correctly.
I found the assignment instructions to be quite confusing.
Good course that gives a basic idea how management works and what is the difference between managers and leaders.
This one starts out pretty slow, in fact I had a hard time getting myself excited about working through the material unlike the ML specialization.
good overview of the subject.
great for introduction to the domain and understand what and how...
migth not be enough if you want to go deep into it
Some of the evaluation methods just allow other people how doesn't do to much work to just pass...
Ironically, I could find some old video lectures of this course on YouTube.
Really poor presentation of the material although a lot of things are covered.
This course introduces the key topics of Machine Learning, but the math behind the algorithms is not explained and the programming exercises are too easy.
In general it could be argued that this is a problem with all coursera courses.
Professor seems nice and knowledgeable but a bit more relaxed and/or engaging approach would be beneficial to many.
For example, is this really an “intermediate” course?
It would get 5 stars if it was based on all open source software.
You actually have to see the picture, as the voice channel just references it.
I can certainly recommend this course to people curious about data analysis.
The lectures are fine.
This course was very scattered and included several different lecturers.
It's so low that I can do nothing now after learning with every work in this course done.
The explaining part could have been better.
Need an analysis of past cycles, and a fresh view on whether the current slump is part of a similar cycle, or a new era?- America's insistence on energy independence, how/why Europe views independence differently, how China/India view their own?- Current Middle-East politics Iraq-Iran-Saudi-Qatar, historical and current role of Saudi Arabia in the OPEC cartel, and the reality and dynamics of spare capacity within OPECStudents should come out of this course with their own view of whether this is the last leg of the fossil fuel race (as hinted by Prof. Lucciani in the COP21 video), or just another bend.
I finished the 5 week course in 5 days - hence making me question the value of it.
We present their histories, their philosophical underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations designed just for this course."
I actually think that the exercise is quite rewarding, but the expectations of, and directions for participants aren't entirely clear (and that's coming from a native English speaker).
However it would be much appreciated if more calculations could be incorporate into this course.
It would be nice to have a more extensive course on this subject.
Great course for somebody who does not know anything about data science.
Well course teaches basics of python but you should always refer to python documentation in order to understand the concepts correctly.
There is also a very nice "example" project (designed by one of the mentors), which provides a lot of useful info (how to filter missing values from variables,...).
But there is no real hint as to the depth of analysis we are expected to complete.
Great teaching methodology - although the test are a bit too centered on number crunching and not reasoning.
It gives a significant coverage of many important command line tools.
Good general information on basic financial literacy.
I did enjoy the course enough to see it through but it could use help on presentation correlation of lessons and tests
I learned many thing in this course.
At the end of the day, this course does give an entry level data scientist such as myself the ability to do some 'cool' analysis, which I truly appreciated.
Apple, banana, orange...", then the week after it's "Which sport do you like?
I mostly read the transcriptions instead of watching the videos, because the teacher would just stand there and talk without moving, and it was not stimulating to me.
It would be a lot better if they took the time to actually craft custom Python lessons designed specifically for this course instead of using ill-fitting lessons from other classes.
The course content is very good and useful.
Good overview... but expected more content..
Interesting but too simple.
My interest is piqued from this course and I want to know more about specific wars/battles.
But it misses to cover introductory points in some modules (i.
e: dynamic programming module) as well as the accent of some instructors isn't clear enough.
Good course.
However the initial part ,that is recruiting hiring portion could have been conducted in a better manner.
It felt as if the lecturer was reading out from a text book.
I can get the sense of the most important feature of a new language.
Courses by Brian Caffo were much better.
I already use Bootstrap and still finding useful information here.
nothing special, no significant knowledge gained.
It was good but according to me it had a paucity of arduino programming for which i enrolled .
Rewrite the quiz question set to clarify what you are asking, and make certain the material was covered in the module you are assessing.
However, I found difficulty in relating lessons and get true meaning of the course
As it is I never did get to upload the photographs for the final prompt.
I would have liked to have had more to do with the math and such...
Having come from a business background and going into BI full-time, I was seeking novel ways to evaluate business performance.
I also think ideally you would want to encourage people to write bigger chunks of code rather than get bogged down with word counting.
However, the main issue is that the assignments are really badly put together.
Tsoknyi Rinpoche ("How does Buddhism change in a New Culture" and "Benefits and Dangers of Secularing Buddhism", the TB rebuttal, as it were.
Although Prof. Shiller is a well-known Nobel prize winner, from the first several videos, my study experience is not that good.
I have been very impressed with other courses given by Coursera members, but this one was not one of them.
knowledge-based, no skill-based work at all which is weird since the capstone is skills-based
could be better
The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because it was very general for me.
It's ok. Bushee is very knowledgeable and a very enthusiastic teacher, but his lessons are too dense compared to the content in the rest of the Wharton BA programs.
This Course presented some valuable insight into what the public are urged to believe on this controversial epidemic...
basic but interesting
It also provides knowledge about monetization pratices and publishing pratices, warning the future game developer how a publish may inadvertently "throw a wrench in the works" of game development.
I think this is a good review for someone who has the basic in English grammar; however, if you're an ESL student or English-speaking person (who need to start over in grammar).
Study first before starting this course.
A lot of the feedback in the forum, I found to be poor except when it came from an English-speaking person.
You get a lot of: " OK, Great, etc..", no real feedback.
Focused a little too much on telephone history, though some was interesting.
Well done course.
Too much law for non lawyers
Most of times I understand what she was trying to say.
Solid course overall only complaint is the programming assignments are a bit difficult to do based on what is taught in the lectures.
Please include slides when the course reruns in future and additional study resources for better understanding of concepts.
PS You definitely need to at the very least be very familiar with Differential Equations to take this.
This made taking the quizzes a lot easier.
Overall I am very happy for having taken this course.
Course should had a template with the course objectives, learning outcomes and grading scheme.
very insightful
Simply providing the final product doesn't allow the novice user to see how it is built.
Lower rating than I would usually give for a course because of the way the lectures are delivered.
Learning outcomes suffered as result.
I feel that the content of the class could have been interesting but the organization was messy.
Also, like all on-line courses, this one tests how good the student is at listening, but not how good they are at speaking.
Another issue is the tests.
Even otherwise, good stuff.
I understand that the point was to see how these functions are made and that it increases our understanding of the algorithms already existing in packages like schikit-learn and graphlab.
The course is good for providing introduction to Forensic accounting.
But more is there in Presentation that we have to self read.
This was worth a -2 star penalty.
Good homework and good examples.
I would have liked the quizzes to explain why an answer was right or wrong.
Interesting, but could be improved with further applications.
Materials need to be updated - there are way too many inconsistencies between videos, exercises, and slides.
The example you give is a short introduction with two problems: 1) "I did the website", which can make the participant not to be at ease to criticize and 2) we're no evaluating the participant performance but the website.
It seems more suited to someone who is studying full time and not someone who is working who has limited spare time.
The assignment for week 2 should have been the last assignment in this sequence and was not clearly explained or taught in the videos.
My algorithms' outputs deviate from answers some times, which is due to different software versions.
Will probably have to watch all the material again to have confidence with it.
In general great and short course to get one on track with research methods.
Take this course, as it is good.
So why three stars?I know it is a long review, and feel free to remove it from the list, if you deem it appropriate.
For me, the challenge came from my unfamiliarity with Python not the material.
I am disappointed by not being able to do the assignments unless I pay for the course.
Things seem to be complementary but you should not expect to go through a structured process over all courses.
I wish the course would give me more structured information and examples of applications.
In my humble opinion, this course does not have a correct balance of difficulty of new concepts/tools with the exercises given by the course to practice.
Just for fresh beginner in this topic
Entry level for writing English emails.
It would have strengthened the course if the discussion went step-by-step through a balance sheet of one of the companies featured in the course.
This course is way too simple and too slow.
Very helpful for people who are new to the field.
Interesting learning course.
Overall i've watched all the content but in the future i won't spend much time checking for new Mooc from him.
The topic, approach, and standards were different from all of the other units in the Data Science specialization.
Maybe it's meant for more foundation/beginner level ?
Felt it could have been much much stronger explaining GitHub- which shows up as a problem in latter courses strongly suggesting that toolbox does not effectively cover GitHub for newbies
Great contents as the rest of the courses in the specialization.
Could be more advanced.
Someone might or might not like painting as a concept to learn and the course title also gave no indication towards that.. Wrong to make it a mandatory part as an assignment.
It could be improved by adding more description.
Linear algebra review should absolutely be a requirement prior to the beginning of this course.
They suggested that other reviewers who gave low ratings are ones that dropped out.
I have taken the previous course which was case study approach with respect to which it was slightly tough.
the course is ok, but the assignment require a lot of prior knowledge on automation control theory, which can be really difficult to be done.
I suggest that they should provide extra material for those students who have only computer science background.
An introductory course that seems like it should have been the first week of a more in-depth course instead of being a stand-alone course.
It was ok, but my impression was always like there was too much of talking what important stuff is going to be discussed, but not really the facts themselves.
Your classmates do, giving you sometimes unfair qualifications.
It was a bit too easy.
Hopefully, other Coursera courses are not going to adopt the same requirement.
This course is not very worthy of the money.
It will probably be better the second time around.
Most important one -- If I'm paying for this course I expect my work will be verified by skilled people, not by other "students".
By the end of the course you will be familiar with some concepts of ML and the Graphlab API, but you won't be ready to implement anything by your own.
The enthusiasm of the instructors was the best thing about this class.
Very long but easy videos, lots of repeating material.
It is quite impossible to finish within 4 weeks
I don't like it, but that would be a good point to the starters.
Overall informative.
There's even a video towards the end of the course where a Linkedin notification springs up on top, which even makes the presenter pause for a few seconds.
Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this course and definitely appreciate the effort put into it - Given the newly introduced Coursera fees, I'd expect much more quality in place to make it 70 buck-worth, though
The statement made regarding "eating fruits & veggies regardless of whether they have pesticides or not" was a bit tough for me as I became ill in part due to pesticides and still am.
Yet, it doesn't include how to apply these in real assignments.
The contents of this course will be familiar to anyone who reads popular science books.
very fast course that can be difficukt for young progrmmers
Dr. Sinnott-Armstrong does an amazingly thorough and detailed job, and the progression of the course is well planned and well executed.
I wanted to give the course a higher rating, but unfortunately, the good doctor's explanatory skills only served to confuse and frustrate me, the further I progressed through the course.
It is a good intro course to get set up with everything you may need for future courses, but it's not necessary if you are already a little familiar with github and R.
The lectures dont cover all the subjects discussed.
I would be delighted to listen to lectures about economic bubbles and non rational behavior.
Assignment were quite hard, and instructions were a bit too sketchy.
Not greatly but enough to frustrate.
Pros: Very clear explanations, useful slides for PMP preparation.
Cons: Very easy questions and exams.
Informative and clearly structured course.
it seems good and hopefully will be valuable in my context
Too much reading material and too few videos.
Keep on the good work!
Course is let down somewhat by lecture notes that skim the surface too much to really be useful and outright errors in quizzes and assignments that will hinder completion unless you read through every forum post to find the missing information.
Not very motivating lectures.. Too much talk but lacks the essential clarity
English is not my first language but I have already taken other courses at Coursera, which I found very good, and that I was able to follow using the English subtitles.
In this course, there is a teacher who speaks very fast and it is difficult to follow their lessons.
In addition, some peer-graded assignement videos are without English subtitles.
I'm not sure whether or not I'd recommend the programming exercises as they are a significant time sink but at the same time, without spending time attacking the programming problems the concepts are not likely to gel based on the video and quizzes alone.
There were a number of elements that weren't sufficiently explained during the lessons/assignments (presumably because we 'should' have a basic understanding of coding already...
I guess?).
It covers very basic concepts of time management.
If you have Oracle installed from previous classes, there is very little setup required.
This made it difficult to practice the more complicated material and queries.
This would be more accessible as a guided lecture and quiz, rather than 400 words response.
I hope I was not offensive to anyone.
Constraints were hard to understand even after re-watching the videos.
The structure of the class follows the regular academic model you'll find in college: lecture -> lecture -> lecture -> assignment... repeat.
No place to go for questions or help.
Please be aware this is primarily designed for non-native english speakers.
I am interested to enroll in the second Course of the certificate to validate if it will go into more Details and Background regarding the build of the algorithms theoretically and in Python.
The course is 'too easy' and I feel I did not practice enough!
A nice course for beginners that include basics of communication, satellite segments and services.
The course is very basic, it should have more in depth topics or maybe it should be within a specialization of a complete research methodology, but thanks, this is a great help.
coordination is required between the lectures and the assignments so a to fill any gaps
I particularly appreciated the advice on how to improvise through out the course.
Some practical work in coding and security practicles would have added more value.
I enjoyed the some material pdf suggested.
Quite informative about project decision criteria, gathering capital for firm, about mergers and acquisition and at last about risk management.
This is good for new born managers
While the subject is interesting, the professor sometimes makes it confusing and dense to understand the basic ideas.
Maybe this course does need a mathematic or economic background...
In the videos it was said that personal from SwiftKey will be there as well as JHU teachers could provide some insights.
The specialization will hold no value if it doesn't pose any challenge to its pursuers.
If you want to get through this course you need to have a lot of time on your hands because of the shear amount of debugs your code will produce even if you follow the steps to the letter.
The materials in this course were great, but some of the math was not properly explained enough for the individuals to be able to see how the formulas were derived - especially some of the basic calculus and the regression materials.
It would be great to have a complete walk through of each assignment, showing the different ways in which the same functionality can be created, after having submitted an assignment.
interesting course but you cant do the tests if you didnt pay money (any tasts)
This minimal guidance, I believe, results not in a better understanding, but in confused students writing bad code and spending hours not understanding online documentation.
Were the course fails is it does not explain the basics , there is more focus on trial and error and the questions are not formulated correctly such that they are simple to understand.
This is definitely a source of confusion, not only for me, but also for a few other learners, from what I gathered in the discussion forums.
Also the discussion topics were not arranged appropriately as in the previous modules in this specialization.
It is a very brief introduction.
This course starts quite well but it´s awful at finish
The course seemed to focus too much on the type of companies that use data, as well as what type of jobs there are in this field.
Basic info covered.
I believe it could be more detailed.
Week 4 needs quite a lot of polish...
Anyway, thank you all.
This course is in C++, so if you're not a C++ programmer, it's probably not a good idea to purchase this.
While I get that this can be a 'fun and practical' example, it became stale and annoying.
Provide a clearer project brief since it was clear many people did not understand all the requirements.3.
;-)I do believe it's a good thing that T. shows all the possible extra's one can buy for a guitar, half of which no guitar player I know owns and which, all together would cost almost as much a beginner guitar, but I believe he omitted that guitar strings generally live longer when you clean the strings with a cloth where you touched them after playing.
Genearlly it helps but I hope it would be much better if you have chances to review resume from each other and receive feedback.
Despite it's faults though I would still recommend it as I did learn a fair amount of HTML, CSS and JS quickly.
Not as inspiring as Developing Innovative Ideas, but yet a very informative Course.
However, my thoughts are that either give us an exercise so we can at least have that as experience in using it, or just remove it completely.
It is so out of the scope of this course.
I'm looking forward to learn more in next courses in this specialization.
Nice review of all things learned during College.
Great teacher, although I would rather need more examples of elaborate emails, that I could use at work.
Thank you!
Good course for beginners.
Same case with week3 quiz.
I had the same exact learning issues as before.
Nice course, with very introductory information.
My main criticism is that the online videos were pretty short and not going into a lot of detail, whereas with the questions you had to do a lot of extra research to figure out how to solve them.
I managed to pass this course with (what I know is) subpar code, but we never get to see proper solutions to the assignments.
The course has potential, but as it is now, I will continue this specialisation.
I don't really feel like I learned anything on this course.3.
Analytical and Intuition is not much developed.
It do not not applies to everyone.
The content was very useful.
But the explanations were still good for those algorithms.
The assignments were good as well.
Also, the English subtitles do not always exactly match the oral French version.
Finally, the marking only based on quizzes that can be retaken several times makes it very easy in my view.
The material is very interesting and relevant; however very quickly outdated in this area.
However, the delivery has ENORMOUS potential for improvement... for now it's just slides with an extremely impassive voiceover.
It could be better organized
I think the course would benefit from more structure in the way the lessons are presented, starting with a more general outline of what a good drug is etcetera.
The course accomplished its goal.
I would have liked to see more examples of how people are exploring ways to address vulnerabilities and activities for cybersecurity
so go for it , professor are very cool.
Apart from that - interesting course, I'm glad I took it.
i.
e.
I think it would be very nice if the students were challenged in these topics as well and evaluate them in a better way than just a quiz (programming assignment for instance).
I liked the course though and I believe it can be prepared even better.
Throughout the 4-week course, there was one discussion thread with staff participation.
It was also a big time waster when as a student you were unsure whether you were answering the correct question and if so whether your answer was correct.
While this was all very good information, I would much rather have 6-7 at least to spend more time and have more exercises with the code.
I mean, will an employer find this useful?
Really nice, pleasant video, but don't expect to learn how to solve the problems, because there is little connection from the problems to the videos.
Teaching assistants are hard -working and knowledgable and each has a different way to do things.
Very little in the way of effective educational design.
But they do create useful questions to answer, if you are stubborn enough not to need actual instruction.
The estimate of time required is woefully inadequate.
The best thing you can do is lookup Brandon Rhodes on Youtube.
so you cannot expect to learn about the process itself.
I would have liked it to be more challenging.
The content of the course is very interesting, and I plan to go go through with it.
The subject is abstract and hard enough and talking too fast makes it harder.
However this is only my view and to make it even better.
It shouldn't be explaining about microphones and how to connect an XLR cable.
Also it was more a course on how to compose electronic music on Pro Tools rather than using Pro Tools for recording and editing.
Videos could be bigger and reduce the echo in particular
Great course from a high level overview perspective.
Google is your friend with this course, as always, but if you're looking to gain a lot from this course, pay close attention to the lectures and the supplemental assignments in swirl.
The selection of topics is great.
Particularly the one regarding AR.
Coursera occasionally crashes when attempting to parse or record the Python code that I've written, when that code runs fine on a regular IDE.
I really didn't learn much.
It is quite discouraging for someone starting with philosophy to read articles which lacks a pedagogic approach.
The lectures are cut-and-dry, and I recommend frequently referencing them when completing the assignments.
It's better to just read the transcripts than watch the painfully boring videos.
It is ok.
The first three weeks are really interesting.
The theories for the models should be explained in more detail and with few more examples.
Also, not all the areas of the assignments were described.
I am sure the course will become better in time.
These lectures rely too much on words.
IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY.
It's good to see exact instruments of them.
When he blames China for everything, he forgot one fact that the 2008 Financial Crisis and the resulting world recession were initially caused by the US, not China.
I was waiting to learn more things on these topics and not on EDM...
P.
S.
I really like EDM but this shouldn't be the main focus of the course!
Sometimes the question requirements were oddly or ambiguously phrased and I misunderstood the expectation for the function being tested.
I am thinking that the teacher can be a little bit dynamic and energetic.
There were some interesting insights coinciding with my own experience of learning (I have learnt 8 languages by myself).
Fairly in-depth, but the lecture slides and examples have an antiquated feel and the testing involves very little other than simple recall (typically with examples already shown in the lecture slides).
The course is ok, it touches on some interesting topics and it serves its purpose as an introductory course.
the way this course was presented was quite unique: watching a few people from various walks of life (but most related to the University) discuss various topic and exchange opinion and experiences about positivity.
I liked the material provided for meditation about loving kindness and I have been using it on a daily (well 5 days a week) basis.
why I gave only 3 stars:the material was overall rather shallow - after reading about positive psychology, I still very little substance it has to offer.
in addition.
Even if I have a correct answer to a question, I don't know if my reasoning is correct..
Informative and sometimes fascinating.
Overall I think the course was good.
A little to coach "driven" for me but good information and tools to use for specific conversations.
Especially in a topic which is undoubtly very controversal in public as in academia like especially the history of Israel and Palestine from the 30s onwards it is important to give different narratives of history to the students.
Poor, sometimes erratic and tiring verbal presentation, which sapped energy for peer reviews.
Can be greatly improved.
Vocabulary is very lightly covered.
The material here is good, especially for a MOOC, and it seemed like they tried to make it dynamic with the use of questions, discussion, interviews, and extension activities.
Lots of slides reading, but content is good intro into the field and breaks down the applications real well.
If you have taken Andrew Ng's machine learning class, it's not necessary to take this one.
It is very high level course which will just cover bullet points.
Explanation are very clear.
It often felt like there were parts missing.
This course very briefly presents large picture concepts of Entrepreneurship without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit.
The course explains mathematical models and Excel applications but both are not detailed.
The course provides a good introduction & overview of the responsibilities of the CTO, but has very little specifically digital content.
The course materials are great, but the Excel videos and its background audios are poor, it need update to compare with characters videos.
Network plot usually does not help much if you are researching dataset.
Not Very relevant and detailed as the previous course.
visualized examples?
It's a good course, In the last lesson miss more examples.
However, this course is not suitable for completely new learners.
I liked it, but I had the impression it wasn't as prepared as the other courses.
I missed information about behaviour in wild and domestic animals and also, some of the papers that you recomend are not for free, so some of us can't acces to that information.
I would have, if possible, not rated this course.
I'm not saying R Programming has to be a gripping subject, but this course is pretty dull.
I like listening to the stories/examples but they could have been shorter and the course would have felt like a more efficient use of time.
1 month turned into 2 months, then into 3 months.
It accomplished something that some University courses could not.
I did not learn as much as a 4-week course in Coursera.
Perhaps a bit light on material... reviews from others are very helpful!
I'm finding that the questions virtually give away the answers.
Some students gave leeway to the 500 words limit; others not.
This course was quick and simple.
Quite confusing if you do not have a background already in accounting.
So easy
good course but not fully completed.
I think most of code should write enrolled students.
Very helpful information particularly in the earlier weeks.
Personally feel this can be clubbed with R Programming
The audio quality of the lectures could be better.
Also, it would be a lot nicer if we didn't have to pay to even submit quizzes to get any feedback.
Everything is explained in a way your grandmother could understand it.
If you are somewhat familiar with them and are looking on information on what IoT exactly is, this course isn't really for you.
I watched that one video many times over, but still ended up going to YouTube for actual "training" on the ins and outs.
Good for a person who is new to the subject of business or finance.
Good course , could be made better !
The course is good!
The title is a little misleading.
The starter files for assignments are in place.
I understand the importance of reviewing other classmates work however with the time constraints of today's world, I believe it takes away from precious time that could be spent developing the craft of writing .
Overall, probably my worst experience with Coursera.
Good class but very little case studies or real world example.
What didn't also suit me is a lack of structure and a bit confusing videos explaining different concepts of brain structure and functioning, that seemed too much scientific in the frame of this course.
That doesn`t look really professional to me.5) Lessons mentioned that didn`t seem to happen, like in week 2 or week 3 they referred to a previous lesson which never happend?6) Paying for the Quiz.
The only thing is that the videos where they explain the courses could be more fluid, dynamic and with a better domain of the tool by the professor.
Definitely a "concise introduction".
This course presents an overview of different machine learning tools but I rather prefer starting from the second course were more specific competencies are given.
No additional reading.
The app is neat but too short.
Advanced Data interpretation and solving methods information can be included.
This iteration of the course (August-September 2016) fizzled because so few students were actively participating.
This course helped me in getting introduced to the IOT space, it is very basic/preliminary in nature but helps in setting up stage/ context for acquiring more knowledge and hands on next sessions of the certification.
Kind of basic about the writing stuff, i wish it work more about audience and characteristics of each age.
Slides are kind of a mess and lectures are disorganized.
They are all based on the same process but shed light on different aspects.
I also have the imporession that the didactics of this second course still coudl be improved a lot.
Though at the start of the program indicates no prerequisite I would suggest that you be familiar with Algebra and Stats.
As well as this, the evaluation of this course is based on the result of a single quiz of 15 questions, which is not enough to prove any knowledge at all.
I would have preferred more English phonetic pronunciations, though.
The course if good, but i believe the content should be more didactic.
When entering formula's there should be more clarity.
For me the course's biggest value-adding point is to simply ask us to Google everything on Stack Overflow to complete all the assignments, which has almost nothing to do with the course content.
I thought there would be some discussion of facial expressions, the meaning of different tail wags, and the extent of dog emotion (for example, how they grieve and how long they grieve after a loss).
I learned most of the basic concepts (classes, methods) for whole week 1 from a single 15 minute video-course from youtube without all the struggling.
Important topic to cover....
Nice course
The idea of hiding an image within an image is interesting but I do not see that as important for beginners web developers- how is this relevant to building a web site?
It would be a 5-star course if that were the only criterion.
I've become discouraged about the lack of rigor in the quizzes.
Peer Review is sub-optimal
Unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code.
Good introductory class to the topic.
It's only enter-level for people who don't know R. For those who already used R, it's not a good choice.
I also liked the course structure and the carefully prepared slides.
Nice content but a few bugs with the videos and sound track when watching online.
This is too easy.
They give cryptic errors such as '<some random element> is empty'.
For example, lectures from the week 2 are unbearable to listen.
Great info but could've been delivered better.
The instructor speaks too quickly and I think this will make it difficult for non-native English speakers to understand the material.
It does teach you the basics, but uses Python 2, not 3.
The case studies are the clinchers.
However, I would recommend the one from The Ohio State University ('The importance of India")
This course was very informative.
It is not easy to grade and hard to understand what is expected.
Instructor has lack of knowledge.
I would like to see the more practical information.
I hope the course doesn't face any constraint to get the five points.
It's got all of the meat there, the presentation just makes it tough to digest.
Why were we talking about money managers and hedge funds?
Content and labs are great minus a issue with one lab where the supplied files were probably designed for a later version.
The content of the course is extremely useful for young emerging scientists like myself; however, the videos were very hard to follow because the team speaks fast and with a very strong French accent.
Worth doing, but hardly enough content for 4 weeks.
It would be greatly improved by examples of how to use pandas to solve problems similar to the assignments.
We need Angular 2
The proposition of the course is very interesting.
There is a lot of good information in the course about how different components communicate with each other in android; however, there is way too much information way too fast.
please rework in particular week 5, part 2
The git and GitHub section is not very clear....
So I'm looking forward to try them all!Anyway, thanks for the course!
A couple of times during the lectures I dozed off and had to re-run them.
Course has mindblowing but it needs update
You get good tips for designing games and the different and important things to know.
Good Introductory course on R language
I don't feel it gave an even playing field to all.
It was so theoretical but at the final exam it required so much exercises.
The course is a bit disorganized and could have been better.
During lessons some concepts of statistics were taken as known (which is okay).
So far, its good and simple, this course is for those who really want to make practical impact in their lives.
It was more difficult then previous course.
It's a very special MOOC since they give great tools but it gets a little bit complicated because at the end, you need a tool that sumarizes rather than teaches you programming.
Good to be able to apply the lessons from the individual courses in one, single project, but I missed having actual teachers to review my work as well
Because I experienced a great course with two of the three professors in Leading Teams, I can only conclude that Professor Alexander designed the final assignment, criteria, and quiz.
The course seriously lacks notes and proper definitions of the concepts.
There is tons of repetition of sentences and words mere seconds after they were just spoken.
However it was hard to understand the professors and some of the language that was then in turn translated wasn't quite clear when some accronyms and definitions were a few words off.
He reads all of it in completely, with the same manner, without any interactivities with the slides.
Furthermore, it is well supported in scientific evidence as multimedia materials that help to understand the concepts addressed in the course.
started quite good, but slow videos and the last quiz was about just numbers.
It´s a pity that the free version does not include assignments and peer´s review.
Thanks again.
It would be logical to have a part 2 where theory is applied for practical learning.
The first is that the lectures do not always correspond closely enough with the quizzes, and with the text.
It had 2 modules (first & last) that were more like placeholders and the middle 4 modules went from concept to the maths behind the algorithm very quickly.
Often, instructions for the assignments that are required in the grading criteria are buried in the discussion forums, sometimes in multiple threads.
I hope this changes in my third and last chance to get the certificate...
Assignments require a lot of search of extra information outside course materials.
I have learned a lot in the course, and it is a valuable experience still.
My problem lies with the design of the course, that seems to have started with great vigour at then lost the steam at the end.
Really tough to review this class outside of the context of the other elements of the data scientist specialization.
I looked at the other assignments, but I thought they only asked me to put to paper things I was already thinking about anyway.
In the end, this is one interesting aspect of the language that makes it useful for data science.
I spent about 1.5x the listed time-to-complete on most assignments.
Very useful course for newcomers to Machine Learning.
The basic ideas are plain and clear and its cover major aspects.
However, the value of the course would be much higher if the real practical examples are used in roll forward manner.
Course is OK, not too informative and not too poor.
Please be well prepared!
Good Slides, I learned a lot of IoT and AR, specially IoT.
Unfortunately, the Professor only reads the slides.
A good introduction in general.
However, more practical exercises are required.
A good starting point in Urban Infrastructures Management, but too theoretical.
On the other hand, the quizzes were very poorly designed.
The links to other videos were useful on the text documents that were available to read.
I also think more screen shots and a greater number of screen changes would improve the experience.
I could list the issues with your lectures, but they're so easy to detect by anyone who is watching them actively.
Is there a difference?
And once my classmates reviewed it and moved on I was forced to switch sessions because "nobody" was left to grade any resubmissions.
Several errors on the correction of exercises, not so deep material about the statistical analysis.
You're basically given links and references to what to learn by yourself.
The first couple of classes were really cool and inspiring, but the later two became more of the same and kinda took my inspiration and motivation down to finish the course.
It is too hard and with no "translations" on what the hell is going on.
The flows of courses instructed by Caffo(Statistical Inference and Regression Models) are too long to concentrate it and the quiz is not quite related in lecture.
However, Contents of the book is really good, as well as homework in the book.
It is very tiring and little time for such content.
There are some crazy chords and rhythm to analyse and there are advanced questions on points which have been seen very quickly in the videos.
I can't really compare since I new some of the content of the class, but I think it's weel made for beginners as well as for intermediate musicians.
A longer course with more time for advanced details would be better in my opinion.
A lot of good information, but I found it hard to retain most of it without a less dry style of presentation.
I found myself constantly looking online for extra material to better understand the concepts.
I wanted to clear the Capstone project and get the Data Science specialization certificate.
The information is quite useful, but they are not provided in an organised way.
I liked the themes and their order.
I like the diversity of reading, video content and quizzes and the aspects of geology that were covered.
I thought this course would be focused in Object Oriented Programming and all about the best practices, why not?
Following the tutorial which was made for windows was also a bit annoying at times.
Each week contains a lot of videos that, although being interesting, are not directly relevant to the course.
Overall it was good.
Excellent lectures.
However, I think the material could be organized better, and the lectures are not nearly the same quality as the universities' courses...
not to mention too heavy on the PWC pitches.
It‘s very difficult to listen what the teacher say.
I've run this course only on 1.25 speed, which is a good thing.
Videos rather slow and don't keep you focus.
It almost looks like a real classroom, which isn't good in case we're at home learning by ourselves.
I was seeking a more technical and channel specific insights.
There are still many disambiguations of how the Prof. creates some models (again lack of explanation)3) Too many unanswered critical questions remain in the forum!!
Very simple course introduction.
needed more depth
It would help me if the instructors would provide examples in detail of supervised vs unsupervised learning.
I really do not like the R language, I think it is sloppy and inconsistent.
I don't think the nominal charge Amazon will levy would hold anybody up who's serious about learning to process data at scale, it's just a few bucks.
Yes, there is parallel code in the code of the assignments, but it is mostly written and your task is to implement the algorithm using this existing parallel code, while in my opinion it should be the other way around - you should implement parallel code and algorithms code should be already provided for you.
Also, I'm not really sure why I can't start the next course and have to wait until the start date more than a week from now.
Practise is everything, so good tasks are the essential part of learning process.
Because I had gained some basic familiarity with those packages, this class was a bit of a letdown.
The course is supposed to be very informative.
Please dont just tell the student to go and write the code for something without giving a hint.
Needs to cover a bit more
Week 3 was disjointed; it had NOTHING to do with the lectures from that week.
The assignments were easy at the beginning but hard at the end.
I had indeed to look for codecamp to practice all the small commands how to deal with vectors.
Nevertheless, the work felt a little bit lonely since there was not any input from faculty staff, which led to some unsatisfactory feeling after some peer reviews.
Other than that, it was a great opportunity to make a very interesting research and analysis in the framework of what we have learn in the topics of microeconomics, macroeconomics and data presentation.
Nice course, but the discussion forum are not the same as in the old format.
It was only a bit confusing at start (this is my very first course on Coursera, maybe it's common thing to happen.
The rest of the course was good.
Unfortunately I think the order was a bit strange.
Much is said, little information delivered.
The programming assignments, were at times, rather difficult and had little to do with the lectures from that week.
Topics are interesting, explanation is boring
Particularly due to the fact that I am only looking for hands on knowledge on how to develop a game and not create a business around it.
Thus, this course is good mostly for people who are interested in American law basics.
I wish there was more coding and more examples as well as the videos showing more examples rather then slides with text of the properties.
It is good course, but I would like it to be in the more material and details of Python.
Information needs be updated especially with the changes just made in France 2015.
Not a bad overview but overall far too shallow to be of significant worth on its own.
The course is a very good introduction to Python for data exploration and management.
That being said, it focuses too much on categorical data analysis, and I felt the transition to quantitative/continuous data was not very well done.
Moreover, some more explanations about several Python functions or coding choices could be better explained.
But it's encouraging to see this type of statistical course for Python and not R!!
very difficult course if you are new to R. Otherwise an okay course
Expected more interaction with features of the board.
No course certficate is available after passing the course...
There was a lot I liked about this course, especially the weeks focusing on background and theory.
I left a comment on the discussion board stating that I was not feeling safe to do the exercise.
I have learnt a lot or new information and improved my understanding in the filed of motivation.
The instructors are very knowledgeable and explain topics well.
Still waiting for my assignment grades for weeks 1-3 despite having had many people mark these.
If you can't program at all this is an excellent course, If you know how to program in any language this course is not for you.
Feels like somebody is reading a text book.
It was good, but I would be happy to see more videos.
However, the pdf slides could be much better made, since most of them are empty, and the errors in the quiz should be corrected
Quite basic - but good overview of general theory.
Course would be much better if it gives real tips and techniques rather than constant repetitions of the same information in different forms.
I would have liked to see and practice more concretely how to collect data (e.
g.
Would have been more interesting if the slides had attractive colours and videos had good animations.
Where the instructor formulated freely, the excessive Uuuhms and "go ahead's" nearly drove me bonkers.
On the whole, a useful course, though.
(There are basic robotic courses online to help with that, like Peter Corke's course).
slightly repetitive of classification course with no real use-case value except lots of math..
Additionally, it would have been fantastic if a lot of time was spent on giving examples, practical work demonstrated and a thorough structure of how it was done.
Maybe, all this will be coming in the future courses.
If your background is psychology/cognitive science/neuroscience, then you may not learn a whole lot of new learning techniques in this course.
Hope this helps!
But I am paying for this certificate and I therefore expect some kind of support.
Tests are too easy.
The pass mark is very high for a course I had taken because of a mild interest.
dynamic programming week 5) I watched youtube to understand same ideas but explained in much simpler way.
A little bit too basic, I expected more.
Basic but well done
It is really a start in the field.
I liked the course but I would not recommend it as a crash course for the working professional, more like a crash course for someone who already has a degree in statistics/math/engineering who is looking to further their studies in an academic setting where research is the main goal.
I liked the required reading material, but I did not find videos very engaging.
I took it after Functional Programming Principles in Scala.
Overall decent course.
This course focused less on the theory aspects in the course videos, which bothered me a lot considering I am paying for it.
Not enough depth.
Good course in general but it could use more exercises and solutions for those exercises.
the course and the lessons are really interesting and the professor is explaining really well.
The cost vs benefit of this particular course is questionable.
Could be better if there is more interactions with the TAs.
Overall, the course is lower quality than the ones before from Gregory Northcraft.
If it were really about the research he would want my data whether I paid for it or not.
Shame that the format was changed and the quizzes and assignments were not open.
The example code is functional but not of sufficient standard to pass the documentation exercise.
Nice but required a certificate of participation.
Article reflection is a convenient way to give an assignment but sometimes off the topics in the course notes.
I give this 3 of 5 stars for 3 reasons:1) My classmates and I think that the instructor left one video out the course which is necessary to answer one of the quiz questions.2) The instructions for at least 2 of the peer-graded assignments are incomplete.
I had a great and much needed introduction.
Tiffany B.
In the past few years I have taken a number of HTML courses and I know the basics quite well.
But the blame on China for the sluggish US and world economy is very biased and selectively blind, because Prof. Peter Navarro is Trump's economic advisor.
It should include more real life examples and it should analyze a real PE firm or fund.
Good way to refresh your knowledge about PMP .. but not qualifying as a professional course
Both types of analyses involve sampling, so I think it is necessary to keep it clear how that sample can be used to either "infer" or "predict".
Good course, and the topics covered during the course sessions were very much enlightening.
I felt it was superfluous in this course.
All in all, I did appreciate the course as it made me think more deeply about my goals, but I'm not entirely sure it was worth the €71.
does it yield the correct answer?
The classes were pretty good, but the bibliography was not.
It would have been nice to see some more deep mathematical demonstrations of the formulas, at least as optional videos.
It's very light on the theoretical aspect, but it does offer you some food for thought.
Learned a bit but overall it is literally not worth the price of admission.
Written sheets with the changes and summarizing the lectures would have made the course better.
But topic was interisting
I liked the course very much, but it is brief.
I didn't feel like the assignment captured everthing that was taught.
I was expecting this course to be more challenging than Functional Programming Principles in Scala but found this one easier in the end.
One statement, in particular, struck me since, the more I think about it, the more I think it might be true: "The Buddhist Tantra teachings are not accepted nor are they popular in the West."
Very useful course with good information.
Jack Yu is good person but don't why he does not his sentence and tells the less important thing first and the most important in last and because of this speaking style I am having difficulty in deep concepts
It feels like he just copied concepts and pasted them into the lecture and then read them quick.
Well the topics are interesting, they could have been transmitted better, with better assignments and grading score.
Therefore, I would like to see more real examples that delve into the complexities of real-world selling situations.
Please update the better video.
Why 3 legs needs to be repliedWhy painting ?
Felt a little rudimentary until the last week.
Gives a lot of examples of companies and their varying levels of need for data employees.
Still, it's disappointing to see that errors from previous rounds have not been corrected.
Well.
Too much stuff is taught without teachings the basics of the language
The course gives a clear and means ideas about how communicate in works areas.
However, I had an unpleasant experience on the last week.
Good... but not as good as the previous.
The course is good for reviewing the mentioned subjects but don't depend on it as your sole source of review.
What I had a real problem with was the lack of response for problems with the Honors programming assignments.
It's a waste of both instructor and learner time.
Quite easy but I learned a few things.
The course material was good but the lectures being in Spanish with English translations was difficult to follow.
Training material and assignment levels don't match up.
Good basic understanding.
Words... TOO MANY Words!!
Very basic dive into social, feels like it was structured for an older audience.
The assignments and reading make it worth taking.
There also does not seem to be enough people to review all of the assignments, either--perhaps due to the paywall for assignments.
The homework is more harder than what I learned.
Samiliarly as a programming intro class, IMO, the quality, range from the project design and content originzation, is no where close to the IIPP offered by Rice.
Helpful introduction to topics covered in the specialization.
This course was disappointing compared to the first course in the series (Introduction to Data Science).
Also, the examples given not related to the stated assignment
I would have appreciated more technical instruction in how to create complex, involved visualizations and less philosophizing and design ethos.
Hagiographic might be an unkind description but it was certainly very respectful to the great man.
I hope things get better and I give the the course the 5 stars the content would merit if it had been properly QCed and delivered to best Coursera standards
The main reason being that the difficulty of the assignments seemed far beyond the material presented in the lectures.
The lectures made by the professor were really helpful and provided many insights into policy making within the EU.
It´s very focus on primary teaching which is good, but maybe there is a bit too much of theory, I was expecting a bit more of practical resources about how to face a classroom.
More interactive and dynamic videos would be bett
You will need to take notes on almost every word spoken so the pattern will be hit play, pause write out the last couple of sentences (the instructor speaks very quickly), hit play , pause and repeat until the end of the video and then re-watch it in order to absorb everything as one.
And beware, in the peer reviews you will need to bullet and highlight EVERY point required extremely specifically in order to get full credit.
This is my first course online.
Why use this?
I don't think that it's worse this money.
Course should be longer.
This course is not for absolute beginners.
Would recommend it those who have good background in college level math like Linear Algebra and a little bit of Robotics Background from a Math perspective - like working with translations, rotations, transformation matrices of that sort to make the transition easier.
Someone without an organic chemistry background, can find it frustratingly hard.
Third, the tests are sometimes not in line with the previous video lessons and the reading material.
In a nutshell the content is great the experience of the class could be at a higher level then what I experienced.
It ended up taking way too much time to figure how to decode the data and trace logic around it.
In any case, thanks Dr Chuck!
I had loved this course, because they teach you a lot of in Chinese and we can improve your language cultural.
I do think the instructor does a good job of presenting the content
good and useful content but some problems in vids
Connecting to SQlite / GA Analytics dummy data can be added.
The weekly quizzes were very short (six questions, where other courses typically have 20 to 30 questions per module), and and questions focus almost entirely on the pedagogical set texts, with very little attention paid to the art history or the works discussed in the tutorials.
Useful tips, but for the little amount of material, it's not worth $70.
Focused too much on SQL rather than Python, so not really that helpful for people who already know SQL (like myself)
While I like the content of the course but I felt too much of topics were crammed into one single course.
The quizzes were good, but some of the questions were worded very oddly so I just couldn't get them right without several attempts.
I highly recommend taking additional courses in R as the programming requirements are not exponentially increasing and by the end it suddenly peaks to a huge demand.
I wish if you could accept the submission of answers without upgrading to enroll for payment.
Moreover, TAs should be more active on the forums.
For all the Buddhist monastics that visit the USA and the West to grab donations and go back to their home countries, few of them are sticking around to teach complete Tantra classes.
It's great to understand more of research methods in application, but I wish there were more resources provided to supplement our study.
it provide you a good and exact command that's required for you to make a good web page.
The instructor tends to start talking immediately in subject jargon and abbreviations without first giving students an intro or explaining foundation material first.
Course content was pretty detailed.
I tried to access them via both my computer (macbook) and mobile phone, but in some cases I could not even complete the exercise or check the answers...
They made the professors and Michigan State look less than average and caused confusion among the students.
Obviously some people who are not biologists will need this background.
Getting that straightened out would be a huge improvement.
Good theoretical knowledge.
Also teacher speaks too slow, it makes listening even more difficult.
A massive amount of content to cover, some of it quite advanced.
The exercises become fraught if your code is out of sync with the tutor's code.
very good course, but I never recieved the feedback I needed on the forum
Excel seems not like the ideal tool for portfolio optimization.
Participants raised this several times in the discussion forum but there was no response from the instructors.
or video: How to hotel shouldnt work with Booking.
com?2) Analysis requested: In the first week the requested analysis was of a very high level, it required knowledge of financial analysis and hotel area.
The teacher just read the slides.
Good course, but I might have used a little more rigor and material, maybe more exercises would have been nice.
While I have found the discussion portions of other MOOCs to be equally interesting to the class material, I didn't have that experience in this session.
This course could be shorter.
It was a nice course on how to use Dato's GraphLab and an overview of ML concepts.
I think that it is against the spirit of Coursera because it limits the experience of user who are willing to learn but don't have enough money to pay for the course.
A default/initial one-week offering is too tight unless you are only taking the course (not working).
It did not take into account that women can also be violent, if not more so.
I don't like to tie quiz to the paid course
Unfortunately if you don't pay for the course you have no access to the assignments.
Good introduction to ASD.
I personally could not understand some examples presented in week 5.3.
A bit from an American point of view...
Also because of the number of interdependent parts to the application you create, when the professor decides to give you one of the html or js files again to do an assignment, chances are everything will break and you will spend a long time figuring out which variables' names have been changed and blabla...
The professor does not give you a good basis for debugging your code, you need to modify the set up of gulp to show understandable stack traces to figure out what is going wrong.
If you want a challenging course where you have to go the extra mile learning things from documentation and blogs to substitute the lack of detail in order to complete the course, than this is the course for you!I think this course needs to be restructured and the length increased to 6 weeks instead of 4, with more detailed content and understand of each tool and especially more on angularjs
However, good material, well presented and explained.
For that it becomes frustrating.
The presentations are pretty dull, however, with the professor mainly reading through the slides (which mind you are NOT in downloadable form).
All in all, it's not a bad course, but there is great room for improvement.
This course is nothing for people who are new to python.
Thank you so much for the class.
It was a great specialization - enough detail while still being high level and pretty clear and easy to follow.
This can be very confusing and seems as if it is purposefully so.
For example, one 8 minute video might require an allotment of one hour to properly glean all the provided information.
The course is pretty basic however I think it’s necessary to start with good base for the rest of the specialization courses.
I'm Canadian and I know we have lots of similarities with you and I think I should make it for Canada and our university.
Sincerely,Azadeh
I thought this was going to be a more comprehensive course about crowdsourcing and using social media to aid the design process.
Huge gap between theory and programming assignments, however quizzes are interesting and require some time to complete.
Lack practical aspect analysis.
Otherwise, the course is fairly good.
They should have included some advanced example for demo.
However this second mooc is a bit too much on the commercial side (including VERY pricey softwares that few of us will ever use I guess).
This caused me to fail by a few percentage points.
Lack of added resources like reading material to support the course and help advanced students go beyond the course themselves.2.
However, as a professional dog trainer and having studied through the Karen Pryor Academy, I was VERY disappointed to see Brian Hare's misunderstanding of clicker training.
However, I would expect more coherence between the different modules discussed.
A good introduction to big data (last time I was working with it was in the 1990s when a few 10s of MB was a huge dataset!).
I believe this introductory course would be better if it stresses more on the Agile Manifesto Part
For me there is one element that I wish had an explanation or somewhere to ask about it.
The class is a pretty nice overview of metrics in general.
The assignment of the final week felt tacked on and not at all related to what was taught that week.
I am going to continue my PhD in Microbiology and this course was a kind of review for me with some new details.
It is ok but very small
Writing to prompts left very little room to create poetry that felt like my own.
decent course overall, but problem solutions are much missed.
Very Basic Course.
It seems most datas are from late 2012 early 2013, things have changed.
Need I say more.
Maybe it's great for beginner, but the assignment is too easy .
Very nice introduction in the private equity world, I like that the differences are explained between the anglosaxon an european systems
I was very surprised by the assignment at the end as it was never mentioned in any of the videos.
extremely short & easy - fun-ducation.
It is an easy but useful class.
I think it was a good introductory course.
Hi, the prject was nice and at the end I learned some new things, but it didn't have people to provide any guide.
a quiz before the segment to ask what they think are the 3 - 4 factors of X,Y,Z; then a quiz at end to summarize).
The course is an advanced one and not really suggested for a beginner who would want to understand basic concepts.
No further guidance is available.
I never learned any programming language before this course, but sometimes I felt that the teacher was going too slow on explaining somethings.
The course itself is good, however the assessments need to be worked on
I decide to drop out of the class and try teaching myself, as I have done on everything I have learned about computers since my 1st computer in 1983.
I think It's too little amount of material.
this felt a bit thin.
My humble request is to MAKE A VIDEO OF THE ASSIGNMENT WITH ALL BOUNS AND PUBLISH IT AFTER THE DEADLINE, that would be really helpful.
concerning the treatment for different types of lung cancer for example.
There is not support in the forum
There is nothing you can do to correct it.
In addition the 2nd exercise is intended to be do-able, but not efficiently until the user views week 3's videos.
The best two things I probably got from the course was changing my way of thinking from focusing on product to focusing on process (though not always possible of course), and using recall to test myself on what I know rather than reading things over and over and just hoping it's gone in.
What I didn't like about the course was the presentation style, the pace, the content density (very low in my opinion), the irrelevant information, the hand-wavey explanations, and so on.
Useful things covered, but the student should be able to be tested in creating himself code, not just run or (simple( edit the existing code.
A good introduction to the course.
Very good.
Also when videos are as long and fast-paced as it is in the course it would be nice to throw the major point in discussion on the background,this would help clarify and focus the idea the lecturer is trying to convey.
The lectures are not enough to understand the Statistics involved in data science.
Well structured classes, good explanations and incredible interviews
Worth it if you have a strong interest in sports.
It was alright ..
confusing at times an seemed a bit convoluted.
It seems a lot of material is left out of the lectures and slides on purpose and forces students to buy the instructor recommended text book (which is also authored by the instructor).
However, do not expect it to necessarily challenge you to think in depth about your practice or provide engaging discussion via the forums.
Nevertheless, a good way to get you thinking critically about how you want to run your classroom and provide examples and suggestions.
I tried to do the assignment, the code of the assignment are those that i've never learnt before..
i only learnt in the forum.
Though at a high level but I did like the contents and the deliver format which is easy to understand.
Also be aware that there are a lot of peer graded assignments.
Excelent but haven´t this material in english
other then that its an ok class.
It feels like hypnosis sometimes.
Some of the later exercises also made quite of a leap in terms of what you were expected to know about R syntax, although the follow up answers were good if you didn't understand what was expected.
Final assignment is not well explained.
Even though Coursera give you an certificate.
I would add more and better practical exercises to make this course better.
How the University cannot find someone to check the mistakes before publications?
=\It would be really nice if you explained how to deal with it, instead of making me waste hours of my time on googling this stuff.
Although very interesting, this course seemed too short for me.
Professor Kofman is an expert in the filed, but he mostly reads thewords on the slides and shows little or no passion or interest in sharing hisideas and work whatsoever.
By the time one gets this far the participation has plummeted and there's no mentors or instructor help.
Some segments were repetitive and dragged on, though the instructor seemed both personable and knowledgeable.
that's good
Also, the course, especially the later modules, heavily relies on Microsoft Excel, which some people might not be willing to pay hard cash for.
I think your home assignments should be more difficult.
The peer reviewed essays were good topics; but in one case definitely should have attached to the following week.
It could be more challenging and fun if there were more modeling questions.
Enjoyed the coursework; plan to continue so I can learn even more...
I never got contacted by my mentor and didn't know how to reach out to him either.
Content is good.
The instructors have done a good job to present a rather complicated topic in a manner that is accessible to a common audience.
However, there are a few areas of improvement that can be noted for future versions of this course:First, All material is given equal priority in the course.
EG: On a question with 1 correct answer, the solution page would also show the clearly wrong answers as "correct" (or "correct, well done").
Prof. Shiller seems not well prepared.
It is useful to get to know the software that staticians use and some review about them but it doesn't teach you how to use them.
You need to stick to follow the videos (may seem a tedious by moment).
Good course, easy to follow.
The last exercise was hard, it could have been a little easier.
There was a quiz that would allow you to pass the course without having your code correct.
Most classes could be summarized.
Great experience but a little lacking on the details needed to pass the quizzes each week....
especially week
the pace was too fast.
Need to show more stuff on Java instead of focusing on using BlueJ and stuff.
While it is useful in the real world, it was unrelated to the assignments.
The course is helpful for covering many aspects of project and product management, still it seems to be to basic which put in question whole specialization.
The homework was well planed but it depends much more in the student to learn something that the contents exposed in the videos.
Lots of material needs additional study (from different sources) as it's only summarily explained.
More programming details should be included.
The information presented was interesting, and the instructors were engaging.
Jumping through the abbreviations, sometimes forgetting to mention what it is at all.
The instructors seem friendly and engaging, though.
It is a great theme, but at many points the course focuses on "who said what", regarding authors and papers, and emphasizes this type of question throughout all the tests.
The course software tools updated 3 years ago, and the second part of the course does not cover in the same depth the topics it aims to cover.
But, it's good to know :-)
It's not helpful and then it turns into a "just keep selecting different things until it's right" thing instead of understanding it.2.
However, some tasks such as filling air pollution standards were not that insightful.
I somehow feel this course and the next ( the practical one ) could have been combined into one.
I myself, love quotes about life and all.
I checked my spam folder.
The ideas and concepts explained here are really important but are explained/written in a bit messy manner.
If you already spent some time on topics like time-management or personal effectiveness you probably won't get a lot of new knowledge in this course.
But all in all good.
Hopefully this will change in future reiterations of the course.
I found the videos did not always lead up to the assignment, and I think the assignments could have been more clearly laid out.
It's just common sense and a little of vocabulary.
It is brief and clear.
The assignment needs an overhaul if you expect people to take the assignment to pass the class.
But be prepared to do your own research on topics.
The professor goes off on pointless tangents forever.
make us do more work!
This course does not allow us to answer the assignments without purchasing the course instead they should allow us to do so.
It is better to merge the content of all 3 courses in one... very less content
But every now and then I missed some proper explanations.
Further, reverences to articles and books to better understand the subjects were missing as well.
Knowing the history helps but it should not replace more important topics.
The content, especially from the required book is very good but I think the instructor could dive deeper in the content of her lectures and they could be a little bit more dynamics.
A few examples were poorly chosen.
Definitely a lot of work if you only have a statistical programming background.
This course is very helpful to motivate oneself to create a website.
It was good overall, some of the course materials were a bit sparse.
The videos have great graphics and the issues are well explained.
Too many gestures, movements and ahhhs, slides available but not downloadable (what's the point?
Good topics, just poorly structured.
I personally felt the lack of a global perspective on health care informatics practices.
Compared to the first stage where every single week had a new subject, with lots of content this one i feel, just didn't cut it.
This is a useful course, but please look into the spelling and grammatical errors in the text.
Well structured courseCourse material download as a summary would be great (PPT/PDF)
For some of the topics, the Introduction class has more meaningful homework projects.
I was missing the structure a little bit.
Some topics were explained in a shallow manner.
But I do also programming in MATLAB.
Numerous students take this "course" multiple time, in order to arrange for reasonable software development time.
Producing working software was fun, as it always is.
Assignments are too easy.
However, the course structure was slightly unorganized and didn't flow as well as other courses of similar content.
The second assignment is all about a testing framework usage, not really aimed towards Functional Design at all.
Lessons and videos are very long for one week.
The material spent more time on somewhat repetitive examples than it did on explaining the actual concepts those examples were illustrating, and the videos were primarily just lecturers reading parts of the slides that you had already read, but in their own words.
The tests, sadly, were poorly-designed for the subject matter of the course.
Very superficial.
There are some good tools to use, but the information presented it really just an overview and there isn't much substance to it.
A bit short and shallow.
Good way to get started with doing from just listening or reading.
The instructor clearly knows a lot on the subject and the material is top quality.
Of course, this course will give a whole idea about the India of contemporary time.
Clear instructions.
But if you are a complete beginner then go for it.
If it is the case that we are supposed to know and understand about geometric distributions, then the course content should cover the subject.
The language style used in the course makes it a little hard to follow, and I was a bit disappointed with how the whole class was left alone.
Tough call on this.
it would have been nice if there was any a complete but simple example after teaching each concept.
good explanation and interesting content.
I believe that highly motivated learner can get something new from it.
Very frustrating, even as someone who has taken calculus before and is just taking this as a "refresher."
This exacerbates the very harsh "0 or 1" point option for all assignments (i.
e.
Im sure there is more as well.
It gave me a few new techniques to better administrate my time, but nothing that will revolutionize the way I work.
Much better than the first course in the specialization.
Too many dependencies on non-standard data formats, like MS Word.
I wouldn’t take it alone.
Also very strong group of mentors... God bless you mentors!Disconnect between course objectives and programming assignments / labs.
But I do appreciate the instructors' hard work of putting up such a 10-course specialization.
Further improvements required in this course to make sure more knowledge when taking this course.
This course is wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.
I found this course useful since I had no previous experience of Pandas or the statistical features of Python.
it would have been great to get a sample assignment just to get an idea of how it could look like
The course covers a lot of concepts in far too little a time span.
but overall good course with excellent frameworks.
The final exam was too easy (almost a joke!)
I found it was very interesting, for sure, but maybe too focused some times.
More additional resources and a block on adult transgender persons, rather than just a couple of token transgender adults who are Stanford professors, would be nice.
However, for someone a little more advanced in music and biology, I was hoping for more to be covered.
Very convoluted; examples not so clear; still interesting and well produced.
And the assignments could have focussed more on the control part.
Good explanations.
there should have been more assessments in between the videos for the topic that is taught.
too much is covered at once.
A bit complicated for a beginner.
With regard to the 'peace process', we were informed that one of the major problems with 'peace negotiations' between Israel and the Palestinians was the 1948 issue, yet Rabin was clearly murdered because it was thought he would return land occupied in 1967 - so your analysis doesn't quite add up.
Take another example, "What is Love" session clearly depends an individual's own view.
Great content, but there is no point to keep automated-grading closed for auditing students.
should contain more details
Additionally, the course requires prior knowledge about HTML and CSS as well and it does not seem to be up to date with newest language versions such as HTML5 and CSS3
Half of the questions used in the final Quiz shows that this course itself has tried not to develop chunks they were recommending but to make students memorize the content of the video without checking whether or not the content was actually understood and "chunked" into real knowledge.
So, a better name for this course would be "Learning how to learn academically".
However the professors can be a bit more professional, sometimes it feels like Im a high school student again, the way they explain things.
I would also like to see more examples of real world application.
You don't need 4 weeks to complete to complete it!
Be it 2 separate courses, I would rate them 5 and 2.
Negative point: the main point are repeted a lot of times.
Although it was extremely helpful to put my learning into practice and do the work, I found the peer reviews difficult to assess.
Second, the quizzes are excessively easy and the in video quizzes should not appear in the weekly assignments.
Find the lack of vegetarian, vegan, low-carb, and other diet-lifestyles discouraging.
This course will be a good revision if you have known the models before taking it.
If the instructors focused more on showing how to actually do some of the tested material, I would've given this course four to five stars.
Moderator answer in a very short time.
I think it would be a much better experience for students if these first courses in the specialization got more love from the instructors.
I understand why R was chosen to be the statistical software package chosen here, but I personally don't like it and professionally use SAS JMP.
Once again the concepts are simple and the math not so hard, yet I had to do a lot of research outside the course to be able to understand these simple concepts and derive the not so hard mathematics.
Brian Caffo is clearly brilliant and, I would say, seem to be a good lad too, but something is missing.
However, half of the final week is a list of established and emerging practices, so this was quite boring.
Vectors, rasters, etc.
Some of us live and work in countries that don't have a lot of data (I'm a South African and I work in Malaysia... California, the Karroo, and Borneo have different amounts of information available).
Overall okay, but feels quite outdated.
doens't address the vegan lifestyle
Content is not that appreciable in terms of technicalities or theory ; But faculty does teach many good things through examples
Very good, but rather brief.
The tests should have more "Real world scenario" questions, then just asking about specifics terms used in a given process
Great course but programming assignments in MATLAB had too many issues.
Only few starting videos give new information and techniques, the rest 80% is quite useless.
The point was made long before the telling of every plot point in Harry Potter was done.
1.75x or 2x speeds make the pace more manageable and is still easy to follow.
In addition, it uses an old version of Python, which tends to make the exercises slightly annoying.
This could have been covered in more depth.
Other things that could have been covered: why some courses are so large and the function of recitation sections and graduate teaching fellows for those and smaller courses; what a seminar is; the existence of course reviews that can help with selecting classes and professors; how to deal with not getting into a course you really need to take (wait lists, professorial overrides, etc.
Generally ok.
Yes, that is how much I hated this course.
The first 2 weeks of the course were the worst.
And to complete, there is just one Assignment with only 3 questions.
The specialization was going perfect until now.
The material is great.
Bare bones.
I'm glad I took this course, but I don't think that I would recommend it to many other people.
Difficult.
I liked the course very much, it could focus more on teaching metods during the assigments, but still give us a good material, tips and resourses to engage teaching practices.
Professor knows his stuff but has a foreign accent.
This was a fun specialization and am looking forward to graduate soon!
It's OK. the lectures are good.
The course is too long.
So who's to say life forms can't exact on a planet, moon that is nothing like the earth!
For example, in one quiz, there was a question about Galileo, but there was no mention of Galileo in the lecture for that week, and, a lot of the PDF'S were repetitive and not diverse in the material being taught.
Very good course, I enjoyed it very much and appreciated the educated and polite style of Prof. Jeffrey Sachs.
I will however continue with the courses and expect the next module to build on the one reviewed here.
It doesn't really answer questions of what are data science, big data, machine learning, how they interact and how to use them.
In addition, the peer-review had an extra/optional advanced component (analysing criminal patterns for a second city; comparing patterns across two cities), which I carried out but got no extra credit for.
The score I can offer it in good faith is dragged down by the additional "assignments" like "Write you own quiz question!"
Not good for experienced developers trying to learn Java.
The first two weeks the course present a reasonable pace for beginners.
This a basic course and covers the Collaborative style in some depth.
This was a valuable introductory survey course.
Too many videos with repetitive content.
Still interesting though!
I specially liked to have book references and I started to read one of those.
I found however a disconnection between the idea of using the MDA/DPE framework described in the course, and the actual projects which were more into creating the set of documents used in game design to collect the details, create a better picture, and think better about the game.
A good refresher but did not get to know anything new.
It is a presentation with an instructor in the corner but he or she mostly just reads the presentation aloud.
A quite simple beginning, might end up being a little bit too simple.
Nice slow introduction though.
The explanation and content in teaching video is too brief for the assignment.
Good general change management strategies as they relate to a complex health care environment
Needs Improvement.
Lecture and associated staff should participate more in the discussion forums.
But do take them as a pinch of salt.
It's not worth it 70$
Heavy going!
I didn't really feel that there was enough material here to make a six-week course, so that there was a great deal of repetition, and very little context of the Roman period.
However, the exercises are very general and use 'black box' ML algorithms for most of the solutions.
And the last... lections are really boring, lector monotonically reads text, nevermind what - matrices, formulas, etc.
This leads to confusion as dog owners will then believe that they need to be a pack leader and everything that comes with that stereotype.
But what really hit my interest is enthralling optional interviews with different scientists and just talented people.
Many of the items did not assess my understanding of the information so much as how closely I read for specific quotes or other esoteric content.
Hope the rest of the specialization is more in-depth.. Also there are no forums.. makes it impossible to interact when you have questions.
A decent introduction to the topic.
At least four modules should be presented.
I recommend this course for those who have not take any data science / machine learning course yet.
I'm disappointed something that should be simple is such a roadblock.
I liked that there were many practical exercises and it was talked about many crazy new technologies.
Still, I feel that there was a lot of subtle publicity throughout the course and sometimes the focus was more on the promoting a brand than the lesson and knowledge itself (ex.
In some weeks only about an hour of input where several topics have already been covered in R Programming.
This is in contrast to many other Coursera courses, which have been pitched at graduate level or above.
Especially the part about the instruments is very good.
Great overview of many models and techniques, but very high level.
Maybe there are valid applications that can make use of Pandas like features, but I did not learn that from the courseSummary:Better Motivation to use Pandas over standard DatabasesBetter grader design.
For example, it doesn't cover the update version of github website and how to use it.
Informative.
One former student basically said that I should not be trying to duplicate the examples, but just accept the concept they were trying to show.
One doesn't always want to read a transcript but to listen and concentrate.
I took this course instead of just doing my own thing so that I could get some structure and motivation.
I thought there will be deeper info.
The assignments often cause me to randomly search packages for correct functions to use and how to apply proper syntax, etc.
Very easy, but probably helpful
Nice one
this course is a waste of data.
Though, some important steps seems to be missing, so could not follow along with all the demos.
A very decent approach and well balanced learning material.
I think the classes and the exercises could be far more dynamic and didactic, but besides of that is a good course to get a grip of Bootstrap if you follow along writing the code and if you tinker a little by yourself afterwards.
either you get a 1 and pass or you get a 0 and fail).
Bottom line: I think the course materials are useful and at the very least interesting for developing writers, but I'm not sure it's worth the $79 entry fee to gain access to the peer review, unless you really need or want the course certificate.
The course's purpose is to get you acquainted with the broad field of emotion study, to pique curiosity and fuel further research and deep dives into the multiple topics that are presented.
I expected much more in this course.
A bit outdated now, however it is still a good resource to get started.
I was hoping the lectures would be more dense.
There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.
Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate.
But holding out hope it'll prove to be a good foundation for the rest of the specialization
Use the videos to lecture material, to narrate a story or show clips, but put all the resources (mandatory or optional) on a separate HTML page (as other courses usually do).
Thank you for making the history of spaceflight come to live for me!
I was hoping it would go into more detail than it did, but I did find it a very helpful overview.
Although you might learn something, this course is not well organized.
Good concepts, very useful tips shared in this course.
I reduced 1 star because, it has very less illustrations.
But, this should be recommended for only those are interested in Chinese and do not have a plan to go to china.
While I think the teacher is an expert on the matter, this course what somewhat less structured and clear as the other courses in the specialisation.
Was an interesting course but, at least to me, seemed to lack relevant material I was hoping for.
A bit too commercial.
very little relationship between lectures and assignments.
Also, quizzes were not accurate and poorly written questions.
Course is OK. Not too informative or too poor.
A good but simple introduction to writing.
However, please make sure you add extra efforts from your end in understanding stats concepts if you are totally new to the subject as well as browsing things related to usage of SAS or python.
Big jump!
The main negative about this class is that there is absolutely no student/TA/teacher feedback and you're pretty much on your own learning.
The topics discussed into this course are really interesting.
Compared with the first course of this specialization, this second course is much less challenging, require less effort to accomplish.
Skillful instructor, but terrible technical setup, and plenty of faults in the lecture slides in the videos.
I re-wrote it and submitted it.
Overall i learn about new and great tools and would definitely require Documentation while using the skills i learnt in this course.
Some of the data that gets pulled in from the QSTK package is missing for the exercises.
But there are several things that make this course cumbersome.
Nice course for practical knowledge of new marketing concepts / possibilities through the changing digital environment.
A nice introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
So there is a need for clinical correlation.
There is some good material in this course.
The teacher explained things well.
This was an excel course and no excels were available to download, just PDF.
Mostly common sense, but it is a good reinforcement.
Still very much worth the time to watch the videos whether or not you are going to complete the work.
As an educator, I can certainly understand wanting students to think critically but some of the questions were misleading, unanswerable based on the content, or appeared unrelated.
I recommend it to students who makes their firs steps in this area.
However, the assignment portion needs a lot of work.
The rest of the teachers of this course deliver the material in a much better way.
Firstly i think for a coursera course it is not Long enough at all.
As for me, it will be better to have more detailed explanation, because I think it was very fluent.
Great, but easy
Its informative but partly the course fails to set the right priorities.
However, it is not a good course for learning machine learning.
not a great amount of content
However, the modules could provide, through simple graphics and/or easy diagrams, a better understanding of the new principles and ideas that one encounters here.
I spent a year coding, working on other programming languages and came back to this one a second time.
Each week assigns one programming assignment consisting of multiple problems.
Would have been nice to have more challenging excel exercices.
One suggestion to try to minimize this problem would be try to use a lase pointer or a stick or a pen or something similar to help the student to now where the instructor exactly is.
Compared to other courses, the lecturer is slow and often reads from slides.
Quite a lot of material to cover in such a short time!
What really turned me off, however were quizzes.
Many reviewers say they bail out in first few lectures because content seems too far removed from IoT.
The main difficulty of the task does not apply to the course
The first three modules were very easy to master.
While there was some structure, it was quite basic, and the motivation was diminished by "good enough" not being much.
However I can't see a confirmation of course completion.
I started this course as a beginner and was able to keep up with it for the first two weeks.
The instructor is sub par,.
Good materials, but too long and drawn out.
So teaching may not be the first priority for some professors.
I found the course good overall, but the tempo was a bit slow for me and I thought that the online lectures could have been provided in a shorter period of time.
I also found the quizzes and review options frustration due to poorly worded questions and rating choices, as well as the lack of a written feedback option besides comments.
Getting started with the tools
Mine took between 3 and 4 weeks to get through the process.
This is an introduction course, and no advanced concepts are seen.
There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways.
A solid course, let down by quality issues in the last two modules.
He spends too many time trying to explain that he feels really concern about the victims etc.
Very basic course.
Very usefull but can be technical and discouraging
I liked the cooking demos but I am vegan, gluten-free and eat mostly organic already.
While I have a prior basis in the material that helped, I learned a lot of new things and still came away with a better understanding of finance and the international financial system.
The one think I really didn't like is that if you use a new version of Rails you'll have to downgrade.
Better than previous but still not good quility
Good for general knowledge about healthy di
I think that the course is redundant, it is to general, trying to capture to much, and using a commercial program tool that's doing to much behind the scene.
The second course in the specialization is really great though and you wont miss anything if you skip ahead
Assignments did not lead me as constructively through the material.
This course has a lot to do with math and statistics and I find it really hard to follow especially when it comes to the final project.
Some of the videos are very basic concepts on how to lead a team (i.
e.
More like a one or two day induction session.
Good for learning how to calculate ratios and NPV.
Overall, I would recommend this course to a fellow data scientist.
I did a lot of learning.
Informative and basic...
would have liked to have gone into more detail.
Definitely gained more knowledge about diplomacy.
There is not enough material.
I like the content and enjoyed the process but as this is online course, it should be better designed.
This part of the specialization did not meet my expectation.
Also, it would get a higher rating if it used Python, rather than Octave for the programming platform.
The content covers very good the most important theories and concepts in macro economy and explains in detail the relationship between them.
Both practice and rated.
Still if you are a total noob, you should take the course anyway, as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object-oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer.
Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues, grading, and discussion board input, I gave the course a 3 out of 5.
The course is basic, and quite simple.
Good Attractiveness
Adequate information to grasp on.
maybe group assignments with other students?)
Instructor is very dry.
I was quite taken.
The teacher is good in her solos, and quite good while in the group.
Videos are easy to understand and follow, but there's sometimes to little background knowledge about writing good apps, security and good practices.
there should be one or the other.
While I enjoyed most of the content of this course, I felt that it was one long advertisement for Duetto.
The course is interesting and entertaining at times, though seems relatively undercooked.
Nevertheless, since it is a paid course I expected to find more theoretical content
I think you could keep the instructor in a PIP box all the time, and perhaps put him in first plane only at the beginning and end.
Also, the presentation is , awkward and amateur/primitive, imo.
the course is very useful, but the video lessons are very very short, no enough examples, forums also need presence of tutor for help .... it would be of better value specially that comes from great professors...
i really thank professors for their efforts
It would make a better impression.
The course content was well-thought and well-balanced, the professor had a great way of presenting the material, but the english language part needed some editing.
It would be nice to be able to skip this course and still get the specialization completed.
Also, tell people to use 'parfor' to speed up the computations.
Otherwise, great course!
It's good for undergraduates, and people returning to academia (say, before starting a Master's course).
Good course for those with limited exposure to business metrics.
The other learners who I did have a chance to share work with were wonderful and thoughtful and several also expressed similar frustrations.
The course wants to make you behave like a machine, for a part of your job.
If the course stops here, the text may be a good reference for students to explore on their own.
I would have appreciated a copy of the figures and grafique shown.
And the splicing between the old course and the new one is sometimes discontinuous (though, to be fair, they warn us about that at the beginning).
Nevertheless, I would still highly recommend the course to anyone looking for a thorough-going university-level course in critical thinking, and basic argumentation.
But after all everything when was good
It is easy to follow, it should be a 2 week university course, but IMHO it should cover more about the data type problems that can arise with R loose data types.
good course, but need to pay for tests
When Price or MR determines equilibrium between S and D etc.
Fortunately, my classmates were very supportive and understood the spirit of the assignment.
Honestly, it was a good crash course into data science in python.
The assignments are in line with the course material.
Very basic course that provides basic background information on project management.
There are some points where it's easy to fall into a rabbit hole, like I did.
There are far better courses on this subject, from the University of Alberta (Coursera) or the University of British Columbia (edX).
I had to google almost all assignments.
Even though there is a lot of useful information in this course, I personally don’t like it.
The instructors did nothing.
However, there were a few important issues:Lots of typos in the slidesLots of problems with the assignmentsAt the end, I feel like a beta-tester (it would be OK if it was clearly stated and if we had a discount).
It could also be nice to add 1 or 2 weeks to this course.
This course in particular also includes lots of optional content that is either unnecessary (The Best Taco in the World video, for example) or for which it is unclear how to apply to Python (An interview with the inventor of JQuery, for example).
And everybody can grade as he wish.
Good for healthy living
Good things:• Simple, clear concepts that serve as a foundation for further study of finance.• Many examples, repeated often to help gather basic ideas.• A pace that is easy to follow.• Friendly lecturer, even entertaining at times; which makes lessons fun to watch.• Helpful and kind teaching assistants.
Not so good things:• Lessons alone don't teach you what you need; they don't even hint at some formulas that are necessary to pass the test.• Because of that, expect to find surprising problems and ideas on tests.
Nice structure although needed more assignments outside just the quizzes, to get you to use the skills
The whole curse relies on the automated grading system, which is still a little sloppy.
More on the role of the interviewer than the actual design of questionnaires.
The exams did not explain why the wrong answers are wrong.
The instructions are uncertain, with typos.
The biggest drawback is the need of using Flash to view most of the lecture.
This course would be great if you are experienced in Python or any other programming language.
The some of the quiz questions in this course were broken since they were missing details that we crucial to answering the questions (missing weights or having wrong answers since the posted values didn't align with the answer).
and it didn't help me figure out if I actually did learn something by typing out all these codes.
Students need more clear written information than just lecturing in Video as referring to lecture notes as needed would be more efficient.
Quizes are not very educating this time.
In most parts of the course there are a lot of technical concepts, and the course lacks any type of resources.
It started good but ended poorly.
Questions are a bit vague
Object-oriented programming in R requires more than a single assignment to grasp- even at a superficial level.
I will not expect him to be as thorough as he'd be in his lectures at UIUC (although why not!)
This particular module (week 3) is written for those students who are already have at least a nodding acquaintance with the software.
The videos move so fast that I am not able to detect what is going on.
I have two general comments:The first comment is .
Expected more technical details of this course.
The course title is very misleading.
I will start with you do learn a lot from the videos (and the stuff you learn is very valuable), it's the absence of staff or professor involvement that is a problem and why I am not giving 5 stars.
I basically took the entire summer off.
steps for exercises are not clear.
Ok as intro to chinese language
There are plenty of them these days, the same or just similar.
Well tught, but overall I prefer more business related classes.
Nice introduction, although I don't see any reason to call this "a course", if it's less than 2 hours total (at least it felt that way) while we have to listen to an intro every 5 minutes of it.
Would've rated it 2 stars based on the content, but the level of presentation was really good and I appreciate the effort.
Great instructor!The content is basic and with appropriately narrow scope of theory and applications.
Swirl() is great.
Although better than the previous course, it still was not very insightful.
To be honest, I like the subject but found the course material and content not very well structured.
easy to undestand, but it needs more examples
Also, some basic knowledge in ML also is necessary.
The much better way for lecturer is to explain it by oneself, not by just staying there and repeating what I can read from my display.2.
Another thing I liked very much was students' commitment and achievements as exposed in the peer-reviewed assignments.
Course would benefit from radically different approach to video-lessons.
Some of the course material was objectively wrong.
It could have been the third or fourth week of this Mooc, so it would have time for a further deepening of the matter addressed.3) Amount of content: Adding the video, quiz and analysis, are about 30 content.
Otherwise, not worth 2 courses of money.
Stayed away from complicated, deep-dives of information
I like the content at a high level, and I have a better appreciation for the value of graph analytics.
Light introduction using jQuery and Bootstrap as shortcuts.
The second test should be compulsory for also the non-paying students!
My commitment was 20 hours per week, under some pressure.
Very interesting course - Thank you.
Very basic, decent information.
For my expectations it was a little bit too simple, but mostly the quizzes were too easy.
If you're from elsewhere (Canada), this course would not really apply.
The lectures are interesting but not helpful for use in business.
I honestly felt this course wasn't for me because I wasn't learning enough.
I am not in anyway in the fashion industry nor aspiring to be so this was just like a "tester" for me.
This is good and provides a much more real learning experience than some courses.
For pure passive learning I would give 4.5 stars, but the lack of any instructor interaction AT ALL, and the obvious lack of attention to consistent (and totally correct) calls to fix simple errors for years now,drags it down to 3 stars in my book.
Other than that, another great course!
The course, however, has two fatal flaws.
Although the content was informational, the presenters were uninteresting and made watching the videos hard to do.
It's, for sure, a necessary content but don't feel like something that deserves to be on this specialization.
Also the very last section is entirely made of a rushed-maths lesson, and a quiz based on that rushed maths lesson that is VERY difficult.
Weeks are not very balanced.
This topic is so important and relevant to big data.
the information is providede on a bit higher level
I would recommend it to be more data oriented like those case studies with specific examples so that it naturally converges to creating case study for a city at the end of the course as final project rather than optional study.
The exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges - except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files.
Probably a good course if you aren't terribly familiar with GIT or some form of version control.
Very out of date.
It would be better if a couple of practice exercises were put after the relevant lecture videos and not just after the weekly lecture videos.
Enjoyed this course less than the other courses in the series.
Even though the teacher is nice, the description of the course made me hope that it would be more interesting visually.
I am sorry but this class is not helpful for me, I do thank you the teachers but please do remove me.
Also, she is looking down to read all the time and this doesn't reflect her knowledge.
This is not the best use of video.
But most seemed to be equally if not more confused.
I think the addition of more functions in SAS/Python would be useful.
Luckily, I have some prior knowledge of the subject, but sometimes it was not so clear for a complete beginner.
I am no used to this educational system so I find difficult to follow without any proof or demonstration of the mathematical tools.
In my other classes, at least 5 reviewers are required to review each individual assignment.
Interesting and well presented information.
I am now able to use vlookup, iferror, subtotal, and more.
Explanations are good and materials are solid.
ALSO, AFTER FEEDBACK THERE SHOULD BE A CORRECTION ASSIGNMENT OR A GROWTH OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE FEEDBACK AND MAKE YOUR PROJECT BETTER.
This course has contents that are repeated multiple times throughout the course.
However, he often presented his political opinion as scientific fact.
You will get out of the course what you invest in it.
A bit disorganized and rambling lectures.
Not so much hands-on work in this course.
Give us more homework please!
Its very informative but not attractive.
Some of the videos refer to a "next lecture" or "previous lecture", which isn't included in this class.
i enjoyed the interviews -- hearing and seeing many different artists using the same medium in very different ways
Another good and interesting course but the total lack of engagement by the course team and community mentors makes it hard going.
Kinda disappointed that in a course about Communication, Margaret can be such a "so-so" communicator herself.
Good foundation for the following classes.
I hope following course will focus more on Raspberry Pi specifics.
It would be better if the assignments were not guided so straight forward.
I found the mathematical and statistical concepts applied to modelling interesting.
Some important and helpful things are left out.
Overall, it's a good course for beginners.
The assigments were ok, but too guiding.
This is my opinion.
I would recommend to take the other R programming course from the Data Science track before.
This was quite frustrating because I use the quizzes as a means of checking my understanding and retention of the material.
It would be better if more videos with more details could be made.
A little dated, with most material and research presented from the glorious days of 2012.
Fun and useful
rather hard to understand
Also, I think the lectures are from 2013 so I am wondering if this course is being updated and covering the most current research in public health?
would be better if more simple language and examples were used
There were some useful examples in this course.
The assignments were not honest with the time estimates.
Finally it gives the impression that academics know barely anything about the subject.
If you never read about weight loss anywhere, this course can help you.
In my case, I felt much difficulty because I do not have any knowledge in the hotel industry.
A part from that, the course is really awesome.
The lectures also had no time in between slides to pause, write notes, and make sure I understood what was just said.
Same applies for hands in back pockets, posture when sat down, lens flare etc.2 - As instructors you have offered very little teaching.
However, I wished it covered certain in greater depth such as the Quantitative methods of Marketing Research.
everything is there butshould be deeper for experienced persons
Bit basic for me
However, this course has very little in-depth information (pun not intended) and I would like to know more about the actual tools used to design water policies.
I did like how they used various links to supplement the course (ie a chapter from a interesting text book) to help illustrate points in topics.
For the most part they read from slide decks that were also on the screen.
The lecture is clear, but it's a fundamental lesson which could not learn many things, just theories.
The course left too much of the work to the student.
I believe this course is critical and much needed given where the Industry is heading.
In addition, the quizzes are poorly written.
Double it !!
The courses in the specialization are - in my opinion, excessively short.
Is a little basic introduction to InfoSEC but is nice a good to start.
I find that pretty disappointing really.
I decided living with 8/10 correct questions was better than having a stroke while in the pursuit of two extra points.
I am afraid tha as a final project it was not of a very high use for me.
As a learning course the final project was specification-less.
This course is fine, but by week 3 and 4, it is already getting very advanced.
Very good place to start for beginners with some scientific information.
They can be found here (https://www.

3) There is no "call to" go to forum for open discussion.
Need very strong skills and experience in Python.
And assignments could be less ambiguous and more clear.
The help is also a bit shallow when doing the actual tasks.
good as a start
The video and audio were presented in a professional high quality format that you would expect from a major university.
I felt the course covered mostly simplistic, obvious stuff and left out a lot that many students wonder about.
One topic that was covered was the different activities of professors.
This specific course traded off depth and detail for breadth of topics.
Prof Brian Bushee is really excellent but I felt that Prof Chris Ittner's lecture was quite fluffy for an analytics course.
Off to the next :-)
lessons seemed to be very simple,
The peer grading got a little annoying as sometimes it took forever to get feedback and a lot of times feedback was minimal or the criteria for grading was vague and people took it WAY too seriously.
There are no contrasts, no highlighting — that looks as a draft, not as a final course worth spending the time, effort and money.
Its a very nice introduction to a way of thinking and the examples used to argument the theories were very entertaining.
It takes longer time for me to understand the quiz and find more information relative to the quiz items from Chinese materials.
But, the professors for this class seem to be very passionate about the course and they teach well.
Functions were introduced briefly without time to digest.
Github exposition is a little complicated.
The presenter was good but the course was too basic and barely an overview.
However, it does not offer an unbiased opinion about EU as can be seen from the title of the course.
This course is very thorough, but I did not feel that the lessons often prepared me for the programming assignments.
Is very basic and don't send assignments becose I don't pay the course.
Please, give more complex exercices to prepare before the final assignment.
Specify the minimum grade to pass the assignment if it 80%, then say 80% .
Rather, I have had trouble with seemingly simple questions such as when to use past tense and when to use present tense in a literature review.
All the complexity of the course is concentrated to the last week.
It is not like that we don't know them at all, It's just we don't pay much or enough attention.
I start using this method from today and I hope it goes well !You should try this course, I think it worth it !
Starts off informative and then becomes very basic.
Introduction to data structures.
I'm not a native English speaker.
Also the weekly content should be more extended.
First, the slides are not masterfully made; proper word count and transitions are not applied.
This is a nice introduction to social media marketing with professional insight from Randy Hlavac.
Great materials, great learning system!
It leaves the impression that the course was designed and then abandoned.
test questions far too easyslide show lessons not well structured and too focussed on repetetive concepts
the presentation was needed to be change a little bit, to get the postive attention
I even used "evaluate formula", F2, trace Dependents/Precedents to understand how it has to work.
I would advise you to rewrite the question and to make it clearer whats required.
So many things are taught over a 4 week period that if you do not do the extra reading to understand what is happening you will get an overview of angularjs, bower, gulp, grunt, yo, yeoman and so on without really knowing how to use any of these tools again.
I tend to think that revising the approach to this course as two 4 weeks modules would allow to both go more in depth at a more appropriate pace.
Quiz questions don't reflect the content.
Still, the teaching is excellent.
Its an interesting course.
But these minor issues will most likely get resolved in subsequent offerings of the course.
This course is really good for Ruby beginners but it doesn't provide enough basic information on Rails framework.
Being the second course in the specialisation, it doesn't actually live up to the expectations as it mostly covers the very basics of the excel functionality in terms of modelling.
Beautifully executed and fun to hear Michael Pollen speak, but sooooo easy.
It can be termed as a introduction to the specialization
It was interesting and informative course.
Some more discussion in forums should be encouraged.
Don't expect to learn everything from the lectures and materials to be successful in this course.
The course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism: it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting today.
Being a basic course, it is very easy to follow and finish.
Take your assignments seriously and invest a lot of time, even if you know that you are able to pass with a lesser effort.
The videos might seem short, but are filled with tons of information.
All of the assessments are done by the people in the course and I thought people were a little too harsh.
A good course to understand the basics of Python, though there's no difference between the book chapters and the video lectures (lectures are basically readings of the chapters) - I expected more info in general.
Also, the information provided was in huge amounts but not in details.
Good content and GREAT assignments.
Really like the panel discussion and the interactive questions.
Would have expected international approach as Coursera should appeal to World.
Should include recent material.
This course is a good start to give an overview on the toolbox you should be aware of to specialize in Data science or analysis.
Would have like to jump straight to the material.
Tableau with R session can be incorporated.
Overall, this course has an above average quality with an acceptable level of engagement.
The explanations are a bit and drawn out.
The -2 stars is due to complete absence of moderators leading to a defunct discussion.
I think this should be looked at.
The teacher seems really nice and explains things really clearly, however the content of this course is not as helpful as I believed.
not for ones who can google
It's really interesting course i like it very much thanks for all your cooperation and your education methods and thanks to coursera
not really possible to give a higher rating.
at the moment too many problems.
it's a quick efficient way to know some trick if you are an absolute beginner, now if you have some knowledge or already read a lot of articles about procrastination Etc, it won't help you discover new things, or tips, it's a cool way to review it though.
However, there was no ability to submit feedback.
These then combine into the final submitted assignment.
I felt that someone was giving me the right answer for everything and I wasn't supposed to think about it all.
I would rather focus my attention on the large gap between reality and "scientific" claims.
But I'm not quite sure which is the order I should follow when dealing with a project.
Great level of detail and information.
That said (other shoe dropping here), the other half of the course was videos of people reading their prepared academic papers, in monotone or semi-monotone voices.
But I really got help of the discussion forums to complete the assignments but am not yet clear about the theory of aerial robotics.
First.
I would prefer Dr Navarro teaching this topic and hearing his perspective on stock market.
And so on and so forth.
To be fair, the content is golden, although the papers seems to be geared to the academic community, rather than the student community.
but a more elaborative explanation with more notable examples (instead of pointing to the reading material at the end of 4th minute of the lecture) will be more fruitful and a better learning experience.
The programming assignments are challenging and will definitely open up the thought process towards being able to imagine what patterns mean and how to go about extracting them.
Perhaps more disturbing is that most of the (apparently) native English speakers seem not to have taken any notice of either the lectures or the peer grading rubrics.
Despite the shortcomings in the peer review process the material is well presented and offers a strong framework around which students can build good effective essays.
Once again, the lack of a forum in this course makes life unnecessarily difficult and frustrating and for me pushes my rating down from a low 4 to 3 stars.
I don't like presentations with reading only the visible content.
The teacher could be more enthusiastic because sometimes it turned boring.
I find that hacker rank is probably better at delivering value (if you can forego the warm fuzzy feeling you get from getting a verified certificate, you'll probably be better served by practicing on hacker rank than from doing the problems in this course).
All homework were to modify from an existing code, and all lessons were skimming on indexes.
Some good content however it is too reliant on reading a lot of white papers and articles.
I didn't find the teaching style very effective either, though it may work better for others.
It would be good if it can provide real world problems and how to approach to solve them.
The reading materials were great.
:)Thank you Professor, TA's and Coursera!
I really liked Karl's casual and somewhat spontaneous style - this is a breath of fresh air from the video tutorials out there where lecturers are reading from prompts or reciting from memory.
The biggest drawback to this course is that it relied completely on peer grading for the assessment (which you have to pay for).
good course.
Its a great course for someone who have just wanted to learn programming or have a little prior knowledge in programming.
videos were very clear and the explanations were clear
I liked the assignment, and the course... for the most part.
Exams are not very good - some ambiguous, misleading or wrong-data questions/answers.
I am confident of using these frameworks in the future.
Lots of things are learnt.
its very basic stuff , and uses not optimal solutions to coding challenges , which might be okay for basics , for example the spelling check/suggestion project algorithm is probably exponential in time complexity .
early Universe and its development over a time span of billions of years.
I had reached the last session of this course when it suddenly became impossible to access the video.
Some of the sides even re-use earlier lesson slides in the beginning as a "review", much like soap operas re-use scenes from earlier episodes as "memory recall" to fill air time.
It would be even more interesting if the chinese caracters were written with the Pinyin (and not just the pinyin).
reviewed.
A fell I now have a good basic understanding of python but not enough to do any real analysis.
I chose this course to learn more about technical skills to do research in data mining, data science, and machine learning.
In short, I am somewhat disappointed with the course overall.
Although I found the instructors and guest speakers extremely knowledgeable, quite a bit of the material was repetitive within in each week's video clip content.
Explanations are very understandable and given with a lot of examples.
Lack of exercises and communication.
The teacher spoke very clearly, but the transcripts of each lecture should have included the Pinyin transcriptions.
Should include much more detailed explanations especially when explaining some of the complex algorithms.
Great course, although I would've liked a bit more emphasis on coding.
She is also an engaging instructor but I found it difficult at time to discern what the salient points or "take-aways" were from the lectures.
The content was well explained but a bit "light".
every.
Not a bad intro; I don't know if anyone would benefit taking this as a standalone (or for an entire 4 weeks, for that matter).
The materiel covered in the course was great, but more assignments instead of quizzes should be added.
it's ok
This particular student drove the discussion of assignments, leaving little room for others to explore, ask, and answer questions.
The course content was very interesting, however, the way it was presented was very dull and monotonous.
Good start to the course.
Some of the material is a bit dated too.
Overall, it was structured nicely and not terrible.
Good course but a little more detail with better referencing to links and documents would be more helpful.
Here's one: https://asunow.
asu.
edu/20151027-study-shows-angry-men-gain-influence-and-angry-women-lose-influence
In general focuses more on how to do, but due to course length skipped on some of the how or why in certain topics.
This course provides general introduction to software product management which can help students to pick up founding concepts of a number of how a product management cycle looks like as well as the spirit of agile practices.
As an introductory course, the material do not cover practical tools or details on how the actual product management should carry on.
The course is well structured and remains focused on the topic on hand.
Not a clear value add over a "final exam" format to justify waiting days for someone to "grade" your work.
It gives me a great insight of upscaling of solar cells.
What is being taught should be just the science, without opinions or biases.
To make the capstone a better experience for everyone I propose that here the reviews should be graded.
How to transform the data.
The links provided are informative.
I feel like this was done to dumb things down so that more people with no programming knowledge could get by.
I really appreciate that.
I enjoyed the start up course and look forward to more, but am battling to figure out how to sign-up for the next step all roads seem to force me back to the Toolkit.
Interesting stuff, but not a lot of detail
Second problem is the notations used in the course is extremely confusing, it makes maths look scary.
Ditch the pay you pass mentality.
Could use a little more depth or at least some pointers for further study.
I wonder if things could be explained a little bit more in the lectures so you are not asked to do things in the assignments that you have no idea how to implement?
I FIND THE MATERIAL REALLY GOOD AND EASY TO FOLLOW, THE ASSIGNMENTS ARE VERY HELPFUL TO FULLY UNDERSTAND EACH CHAPTER.
The course it's great , however in my opinion it's too theoretical with few practical examples.
If you're confortable with matrices and mathematics this course will provide you with very interesting tools and demostrations.
I don't think that the course is for casual students, as it's very specific.
terrible translations!
??
I did not have a lot of experience in machine learning, so this course was very good in the aspect of introducing people to machine learning concepts.
So, if you want to take it, prepare to fight with the grader.
Seems like it could have been covered in a week somewhere else.
Great assignments and bad videos.
It would be a brilliant course if the lectures were cut short and made to the point.
Some excellent insights, albeit a bit too superficial in my view.
This course is for you if you really don't know anything about Machine Learning and nothing about Python.
Not as good as the first one, esp near the end.
The programming exercises were good and provided a good overview.
Very good information a little confusion with the regression it's like doing algebra but I like the course.
Short and sweet, easy and quick and gives a genX some insight into GenY (and now GenC
Fascinating knowledge delivered by instructors whose first language is definitely not English and who make it difficult to learn by their bad grammar, pronunciation and overall monotonous tone of speaking.
Each assignment or lab you first have to struggle figuring out the skeleton code where they could have provided a bit more comments, tips and guidance.
Accent is hard to understand.
Needs way bigger scope and a bit more going into details.
Due to that was involved many ad-hoc works which may not the best practice.
Maybe if you're just starting out and using the same software as Prince Charles, this class would be more useful.
I really wish I could give this course more stars, the content is great and well delivered and at a perfect level for someone like me who last worked with big data sets when 20Mb was absolutely enormous and Windows 3.1 was cutting edge technology.
The course is well structured and Prof Muppala presents it in an interesting way.
With a biology background I had some difficulty following this course.
it is good , but some items needs to be illustrated in more details , a great thing of this course is that it gives a lot of practice exercises
Mabye it would be better that Q2 - Q13 based on a new dataframe which is correctly by all means.
I'm neither, but I took this course because I'd like to know more about the modern art.
The course is essentially a merge of two independent parts, namely, videos about artworks and papers about different theories of education in art.
looks like it has great contents but really hard to finish it , due to video and audio issueIn some lectures , I can't hardly read the blurry syntax and almost impossible to hear
The audience will benefit from seeing the full lecture videos.
However, they would probably need the voice of Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones, B. Cumberbatch or James Spader to keep me awake.
This course was a bit mediocre.
Teaching material is very good.
However, it was an easy and light refresher and provides a lot of useful analogies to reshape (or ingrain deeper) learning techniques you are already aware of.
And I am not sure if i can actually tackle similar problems again without referring back to the pre-mentioned resources.
nice but doesnt give you much knowledge
This would have been better off as a stand alone topic (which it already is by another Coursera affiliated school), or having a capstone course that builds on a topic more in the wheelhouse of the JHU professors: a capstone project focusing on bioinformatics or biostatistics would have been amazing in comparison to this.
useful informations but not very helpful for practical situations.
Although lecture videos are very informative but beneficial only for very basic level programming and to solve these programming assignments lots of learning is needed.
Pretty good lectures that touch on many aspects of fmri but doesn't really get into enough details to really learn about the difficulties with this methodology.
Professor is very energetic and shows he is totally involved in the course.
I'd review this course for two parts: lectures and programming assignments.
Lectures: Prof. Jiawei Han is a pioneer of the subject.
But a little bit more on social media.
Certainly the fellow students do not have any obligation to reply to questions, and I usually would say the course moderators don't either.
Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-usable.
I would love to see this interesting lightweight introduction grow into a solid university level course with more reading, weekly added content, tests, academic discussions and a proactive moderator at the forum.
I had to focus only on the slides, otherwise I would get distracted.
[Slightly updated according to Michael's questions]The course is fine, but comparing to the previous one - Algorithmic Toolbox - this one is weaker and with lesser quality.
Pros: the course contains some interesting data structures and valuable observations.
This seems like a good overview for those new to the kitchen, and/or health concerns more generally.
And an effective talent pipeline would help a lot.
All in all,the idea of the topic is good and informative, however honestly speaking I didnt like teaching method of professors.
Numbered accounts were created to help jews send their money abroad without being detected, but their heirs could never get the money back
The final exam with 60 questions is also very positive to force/stimulate the student to 'cement' the knowledge gained.
Negative: This course was shockingly short.
In particular the last (huge) exercise was frustrating, just being told I've got it wrong with no feedback on why.
I also feel more class management strategies for ESL classroom would have been a more valuable topic.
Thank you for the fantastic effort.
Some of the questions asked for the peer-to-peer reviews were very unclear.
Quiz isn't challenging enough to validate the understanding of the user taking the course .
I'm looking forward to the follow-up course.
I found the other units more enjoyable.
Learning the essentials of NLP quickly is necessary to begin the project.
I resubmitted the EXACT same content in bullet-ed and highlighted form (which was NOT what was assigned) and miraculously received 100%.
The pace of lecture-hall-style discourse in the videos is such that subtitles will not save you if you don't understand French.
These technical and minor content issues are unfortunate, because the core content i s really quite good.
It's okay, the explanations are mediocre as well as the assignments.
even after completing the course perfectly i'm still not sure how I got some answers.
for example: "approximate f^(72)(0) of cos(x^3).
From other courses I know that course moderators chime in once in a while on questions that have not been answered by fellow students and when no fellow student seems to be able to find or provide a correct answer.
The course is good, and you will learn a lot.
The downside of the course relates to the peer-review system of some of the assignments.
Comparing to "Learn HTML5 from W3C" from edx this course is fairly weak.
Thanks for providing full explanations and a set of in-video examples for every rule.
There needs to be much more interaction, much more animation and passion, and the use of "real" people in a "real" environment.
Please don't pay for this one.
Better than Stat Inference, and gave some reasonable intuition, but could be improved I think by focussing on more understanding and less maths and formulas.
Thanks you very much for this.
Unfortunately we can not submit our tasks with do Un upgrade in our account.
Or double the coursework!
The order of the lessons and content presented made for learning intuitive.
I do not think that I have understood futures and am glad it was not required for the last assignment as the answers aren't present in the material.
It was not challenging.
Very basic things... Any examples for regression.
I was very upset with the programming assignments - they are few, they are not consistent in difficulty level and the way they being checked is not convenient.
The course is perfect, however, since I am a person who prefers more concise information and pragmatic skills, the teaching examples with analyses might seem lengthy and not so efficient for me.
A few examples are computing the expectation and mean of the average distribution and computing confidence intervals.
Not a simple class
Nevertheless interesting and well presented over all.
very nicely made course providing a good hands on with R language.
Great course.
It's a good course, with quite a bit for a newbie to learn.
Not deep enough on diagnostic and interpretation
It is interesting information but the essays are in depth and difficult...
and there is no chance to even purchase a certificate.
Good course about NoSQL MongoDB.
Will we ever get to the detail or will I always just be expected to call someone else’s brilliant algorithm and accept the result.
I have taken many courses on Coursera now, and I've enjoyed and learned a lot from most of them, but I have to admit I was disappointed with this one, despite having a deep interest in modern art and art theory.
Anyway this is only my opinion!
4 weeks are to short.
We need more deep and more weeks.
After taking this course, I feel like I'm one step closer to thoroughly understanding HTML5.
In my opinion, this course was way too theoretical.
It was certainly not as interesting nor as informative as the Berkeley class "edible education 101"Still as an advertisement for good eating it was well done.
Although the information provided by the course is good, I do find it a bit difficult to listen to the videos.
But still a good way to understand the basics.
I could not understand because i speak english...
I think it is a little bit incoherent.
Course lectures were good, tho at times a little too rapid.
In all, I'm very excited to be part of this program.
useful for basics only
I found things are a little unorganized for me who doesn't speak English as mother tongue.
I enjoyed the last few lectures with examples of IoT, but could have skipped the rest.
However, giving some efforts on both sides I am happy with my performance.
Lectures don't cover what is needed in some assignments.
The lecturer and his avatar are funny, the course content is structured but the delivery is a bit loose...
OK, big improvement from first 2 in this series
This course is not a stand alone course as it if stated.
I wish that there were more exercises where you could practice the lesson that was learned.
Excellent Courst but you have to pay in order to access the quizes and assignments... very dissapointing.
It was an interesting module, however, not sure how I will apply this in
As someone who's new to the world of data science and doesn't have a university degree this course was very hard to get a good grasp on.
That's partly the "cause" of how the course was taught which was assuming you had all the knowledge at hand of all the stuff Statistical Inference is about.
For people that are starting this stuff it might be nice to have a introductory course of Statistical Inference as I did not finish this course by just watching the course video's and additional information, I had to look up additional resources which explained the material better.
Still, a big thank you for explaining statistical inference and opening my eyes regarding this topic, it surely helped getting me to the next step in what Data Science is all about and makes it ever more interesting!
This course lacks some content.
I wish it had more interaction with the teachers or to at least have more level of detail on the cases.
Unfortunately the lectures and course materials do not adequately prepare you for the programming assignments which is frustrating and time consuming if you actually want to write the code required and not cheat.
The structure and functionality of Coursera itself is excellent.
Not a difficult course but teaches you much about Java.
I'm somewhat disappointed.
He often rambles through the material, spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand.
Would have liked some practice of the concepts presented in the lectures as opposed to learning new things just to be able to do the assignment
This was not clear to me when I joined.
If you already have teaching experience you will get much more from the conversations in the forums than from the lectures.
Please don't call yourself a MOOC if the free content is so different from the paid version.
I would have given 5 stars if this course is not based on Graphlab which is not affordable to the general public.
Neither is watching the instructor sitting in his office talking.
I would be upset if I had paid for this, but I'm glad to learn about meteor in a free and structured way.
Too simple course.
Too few students.
All the emphasis was on the Arch but the Arch looses its very significance without the menorah.
Keep in mind that I still have Multi-Platform Mobile App Development, and Server Side Development with Node.
js still to go, so I don't know if these are explained more in those courses.
The value of good teaching methods is often underrated in transferring knowledge.
It was good.
On the other side, she used a lot of articles from the internet which gave not much knowledge.
The information is reviewed quickly through the lectures series and it would have been helpful to have some practice scenarios before taking the quiz.
Their is some useful information, that is very very interesting and easy to understand, but it is too little to understand JS.
Not sure about the others but I must have spent countless hours and nights working on these with little guidance or direction which would have saved me countless of wasted hours.
My view of the course is that Its very theoretical, but not necessary needs to be be.
Add some wrong code to correct may be better
not the easier way to learn R
The assignments are simple and can easily be "passed" by following directions, not necessarily by writing well.
good but the tests can be better planned.
Helpful, but most of the information was general and could be found on any social media advice blogs.
Although the course seems to be very interesting and cover wide spectrum of NLP subjects, it is full with references to other materials some of them are no longer exist in the location given.
The professors, breeze thru the concepts in few short videos.
Many points are just a presentation of bulletins with a very brief description.
The content is quite interesting ,but the professor was lacking luster .
The readings , though details are a great resource for they keen to take deeper dives.
What was helpful to me was: the discussion on spaced repetition, which boosted my confidence in applications like Duolingo and Memrise, and helped me discover Anki.
For A$65 to join the course and not have the full information such as the hours involved and the final grade achieved makes it very disappointing not to reflect the effort I put in as well as tricky to include this course as part of a CPD program.
... ufff ...
Also, I believe he knows a lot, but a bit of preparation and flow in his lectures would be appreciated.
Suggestion is to reduce the nr.
Very good class, professor is very entertaining.
Great class, but a little shorter than I would like and similar to Dr. Adams other Coursera offering.
And the professor should know exactly the content of his slides, and prepare his speech.
Lastly, a lot of the suggested readings were from a blog that is really horrible to read...
Too little material for 4 weeks.
Towards the end of the course, the lectures could have been a bit more in depth - or provide students with a more in depth reading list.
Course was very informative and the material was presented efficiently, however there have been some notable advancements on this subject matter which would have been nice to see covered.
For example, I am still waiting for the grade of my assignments, specially I am waiting for more than two weeks for the grading of my assignment in week 2.
Still, the material is not enough or you should have to do small exercises to prove that you understand the material.
It requires uploading of screenshots but there is no "upload" feature is available.
However, thank you for the effort.
I would have enjoyed a little more focus on statistics etc and a little less on the mechanics of the library, but understand why it had to be approached this way.
Maybe a little thin in terms of content; besides interesting
in week 1 2questions will never get a correct answer.
I would prefer to have many many assignments, like 20 on each week, at least.
Also, many of the test questions were unclear and did not follow best practices in test taking.
It was a decent introduction to R programming IF you already have some programming experience.
I think participation in the forum discussion in this course seems not so active and less of interaction among students.
The teaching has been concise and to the point which is good but not so good for a few difficult topics.
The examples showed are very good and the lectures concentrated on teaching the underlying concept rather the Mathematics involved, which was refreshing.
I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what's going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept.
The real reason I'm rating it 3/5, though, is that the mathematical notation is all over the place.
The videos did not seem very interactive.
I think this is also the first course on Coursera that didn't get 5 stars from me (not sure if I've given 4 stars once only).
So the bad parts first:Assignments are so unrealistic it's unbelievable.
It is very good at motivating undertake, but need much more to learn how.
I did like Scott's humor, or at least humor attempts overall and I think a live class with him would be better than video.
Personally they should add a free textbook and a vocabulary list with clear examples.
So yes this course could benefit from more detail time to time
Week on NSURLSession and CoreData is ok (but compared to other courses on Coursera - so and so).
I think that the makers of the course are 90% of the way to a top course, they just need to add in programming assignments for each week, where you don't just follow the professor.
Great idea and syllabus.
The videos are too short and missing some explanations.
If you are not familiar with AI, you can learn its basic ideas in this course.
not enough content - would have preferred more examples/scenarios that included conflict resolution solutions
Interesting topics, but not taught in the most interesting way.
Lectures are very engaging and professors do a great job explaining abstract concepts.
Video lessons are long for the amount of the shared information.
Seemed like a good course, however I could not stand this professor's voice so if that doesn't bother you I'm sure it is decent.
The readings were rich with information.
At last, combining the short sentences, medium sentences (10-15 words) and long ones (20-40 words) will also make your writing alive.
I am studying module 2 now, all small lectures like 1 min or 2 mins, which is very shattered, repetitive and annoying.
But even for inherently objective questions "Is the code correct?"
Sorry.
It could benefit with som illustrations for the achy types, since its already around.
However, the older Coursera format was way more user-friendly.
Interesting content but explanations are less clear with respect to the other courses of the ML Specialization
So, if you don't practice by yourself you won't learn a thing.
I'd like for my Coursera listed courses to show this as complete (but without the badge or Yale specific recognition) but it shows that I didn't complete the course, didn't meet the deadlines because I can't do (although I can see) the needed assignments.
Despite its rich content, it requires the students to take a long time to adjust some details at some corner of the method to do the quiz question.
MATERIALS NOT WELL PREPARED
On one hand I did like that I wasn't spoon fed the information for the quizes but on the other I don't feel as though I was fully equipped to answer some of the quiz questions due to the way the information had been presented.
The information built on itself so I found myself going back to week 1 information and week 2 information in week three.
In that respect, the breadth of the course content is quite nice and so well done.
Interesting course
As per Oxford Dictionary:concise / adjectivegiving a lot of information clearly and in a few words; brief but comprehensiveThis course: really brief; not that clear nor well-structured; not nearly comprehensive.
Is it at all possible to be both brief and comprehensive when teaching programming?
There were a lot of very complex ideas were presented, in a very concise and brief manner.
Looking forward to the next courses.
One good thing is that as far as you complete it within the session, there is no penalty and you can get the passing scores.
I did enjoy the different interviews along the way, which spiced things up a bit.
Poorly described, but versatile in coverage.
The content inside this course is well tought through.
I'm really not sure how useful this is going to be towards actually using it.
Highly recommend increase real-life case study materials.
Doesn't really like the Professor's style.
Nice intro course.
I wish the programming part was taught separately from basic.
I had to read them over and over again because there is a fair amount of jumping around and since there is filtering of the data, the order you carry out the tasks matter very much.
I was looking forward to this course and planned to take 3 but now I regret paying for this one and thinking about finding another one.
I thought it was a waste of time.
I did like the course, it was informative.
The audio is VERY VERY poor.
That makes it very hard to understand what Prof Kohler is trying to impart on us..
I often lost track
Good intro course for those who have no prior knowledge
At the beginning they offer multiple data sets to use and formulate a research question, but all the examples utilize only one data set and do not cover the differences you might face with the other data sets - leading to a lot of missed opportunities.
It would also been helpful to have more open ended practice problems at the end of the course in addition to the set provided.
Finally I think this course would be better split into two parts.
Hopefully that will be addressed.
I signed up (using my Coursera email) but never received a confirmation email.
Good overall review: I encountered stuff I did not know before.
It seems that many materials are removed.
Very open way of learning.
I wish there had been more writing assignments.
Theoretically the course is very lacking.
And it is very weird to see same tricks used in this set of lectures, because these ones actually do have a lot of facts and information and arguments behind them.
The whole course is basically just blaberring about vegetables.
Took the mystery out of a few things that were new.
Once or if a student has a solid foundation for the topics covered in this course, this information is very insightful and understandable.
you might ask yourself, someone who doesn't have a prior knowledge of the material covered in the course if you should even take part in the course, my answer would still be yes, so long as you are willing take notes, save the videos, and return back to them at a later point once you build yourself up by studying calculus, statistics, and/or linear algebra.
The instructor is clearly reading a script.
That would be like throwing someone who has never swam in the Atlantic without a life boat!
I really like the main information I got with this course, but I think that it was too basic.
To be honest, I couldn't realize why this had to be an entire seminar on its own.
The course lacks deep theoretical understanding of the concepts.
I felt it was too basic.
Please try to explain a little close, how software devs actually work.
Pros: Really motivating!Cons: Not much real content even for a beginner, too short.
Very basic the first week, good introduction the second and awesome after the third.
Content could have been boiled down to about 3 lectures.
There was many coding that was poorly explained or not explained at all.
I would have liked it to have more hands on or practical examples.
many of my issues were coming from deep doubts i had about this.
BTW some quizzes are invalid.
The lecturer's style doesn't go with the nature of a MOOC.
The whole course can be done in a single evening.
someone get some actual statistics here.
Outdated presentation style: mostly "voice behind text and Excel window" long... long videos.
I'm not questioning the material itself, but I was heavily bored during the course.
Good job on the explaining CDN concepts!In the two first modules, the lecturer just read from the slides.
Good intro course, but that's all it is - an intro course.
The transcripts are not formatted.
It was a nice ride in general and I liked it.
)Interviews I did not watch, that may be of great interest to others, include meditation in the school system by Tish Jennings, meditation in the Business Community (an interview with David Mick), the Burmese meditation tradition in an interview with Erik Braun, the MBSR (Meditation Based Stress Reduction) with Susan Bauer-Wu, and meditation in the legal community with Rhonda Magee.
And all that is just the first course.
I am an Anatomy and Physioligy student so I appreciated the information.
I wished I'd known more about this when I started college.
I learned how to approach the data science problems using Pandas and Numpy.
A negotiator should be a more fluid speaker (in my humble opinion, not an expert in any ways).
In the same idea, the questions during the course would pop up in mid-sentence, sometimes with too much anticipation with the subject at hand.
It would be good if all the definitions and key facts were stated more prominently in the lectures, as opposed to algebraic transformations which most readers can hopefully do on their own.
Overall, as I said, I learned things- yay!
Interesting but really introductive
To be honest, I expected more of this course.
Can become quite slow and boring (almost irritating) if you come from an engineering or technical background (some videos could have been summarised in half of the time).
I also think it would have been helpful to explain more about the purpose of Session.
get for retrieving the features and plotting them into data.
I was expecting more.
Concise but too concise I feel.
Good course, but very high-leve
Assignments were individual and it was very difficult to use them at full power, because they were quite boring.
In parallel I checked out Khan Academy and it was easier to understand.
it started off as being for beginners but after a while it was rushed and made it extremely difficult for beginners to keep up.
I did not like that they do not have any written materials cause at some points they go over written slides very quickly and it is tricky to follow and understand.
Good ,but many complaints regarding PID tuning from students need to be addressed in the upcoming sessions
Although the course content is highly informative and interesting, the way it's all presented it not the best, most of the time concepts are confusing because of this, quizzes become guessing games most of the time.
The first weeks are long with too much materials, that I think, should be separated to more weeks, than last weeks has no any new materials just short discussion prompts.
However, much of the most interesting material is poorly explained; I would loved if fewer ideas were covered in more depth.
Understandably, hardware labs are not included in this online course and the only practice is basic boolean and modular algebra.
Quality of the media and transcripts can be improved.
I don't find it helpful at all.
I could have produced a more cohesive document if all of the deliverables were described from the beginning.
A lot of problems with software installations.
We depend on self-learning more than lectures in order to pass.
All there is to it are 'shop talks' and too little structure.
I wanted to like this course but It felt entirely too academic in terms of both the subject matter and the way the specifics of "data science" are presented.
Lack of information and clear direction.
So, some text books had better be specified.
Homework of this course is quiz-based, only one optional programming task.
Nice Lesson and good subject
Then once we can do that, we could get a bit more technical.
I would like to just give positive feedback: 1) the videos and power point slides are broken in too small parts.
I have paid for the certificate and still it is difficult for me to focus.
The difficult thing is to follow the classes with a very difficult language spoken by the teacher.
This course is very useful and interesting, but the materials of week 2 & 4 is enough for their quizs.
I like the course and the material; I would suggest to include quiz, to the end of each section.
As well, it will be easier to write a story from final task after each section, not at the very end
The lecture was put together as a sort of "Follow Along", but it really felt rushed and more of an "Obligatory" thing than an actual lesson.2) Give us more detail on the difference between Services and Factories.
As I progressed through the course however, I noticed that some rather contentious claims were made to seem to have more credibility than they in fact do.
and there were some additional insights.
When he decides to finally talk about the material, it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion.
(There is one where the lecturer says "Let me start over" and then starts over.
The course isn't bad, but the videos explanations are all way to general, they should be more detailed.
2. the slides are much less prepared.
Simplistic.
Evaluations should require more problem-solving and applying learned materials to new examples.
Colleen is a great teacher though and I like her unique teaching style and viewpoint.
Provides a nice basis in understanding how economic principles are used to investigate agriculture production.
Good course for beginners, but those with higher levels of nutrition knowledge will likely: 1.
Still a very interesting course, but a few technical problems with test and forums.
A good introduction to finance but it's just a starting point.
Not interactive enough
- no answer.
I would love the course to engage us with more concrete Learning
Although the course pace was very well suited for a total beginner, I found the didactics of this course not so well-structured.
This one is just a warm up for the Data Science Specialization.
No engagement from faculty, if you have questions regarding anything in the course, no one will answer them.
Would have loved a little more theory.
Wanted more detail on specific day-to-day routines/ for weaning from breast milk to solids, including learning the nutritional basis for recommendations.
This course seemed to be a bit lower than my level (but I have taken education courses in the past).
Good course, but could have explored the topic with more depth.
In some cases I felt the course lecture (video) was bit tough to understand and few things could have been explained better.
I'm still not completed the full course but i can say it's good course and very awesome Instructor
This course could use some demos and since its a core foundation for the rest of the courses, maybe it should be a longer more in-depth program.
PDFs of assignments would be helpful if posted.
The questions asked in the tests could have been better.
As a medical student I find this course pretty easy.
I audited the course and found it quite simple.
expect more for the next courses.
I would only take this course if you are interested in the specialization otherwise save your money and google the info you need.
If the class required a lot of outside research not included in the class, they should mention that more clearly.
This is may be because I am more of a visual or an engaged learner.
Unfortunately one can not do any of the pear rated assignments or pear reviews.
It's a good approach to electronics but it doesn't go trough a complete explanation about how we found the formula needed to solve problems.
All in all the material, videos and assignments were very interesting and they made up an exciting course.
However, some of the slides lacked sufficient information on notions or did not make references to supplementary sources.
Sorry but yet again a potentially great course spoiled by the implementation, way too many mistakes in the quizzes, peer review grading systems which in places are nonsense .
Very challenging assignments!
This course is really helpful About Database Systems.
The course is well made.
Feels like there is an extreme disconnect from the tutorials/lectures and the programming assignments.
The program create awareness about Marketing analytics, The program could be improved with more detailed examples across different industry.
I think it provides a good background, that is all.
the professor was a little bit dry and repetitive but otherwise the content was interesting!
You should skip module 8 from week 3.
I felt myself involved deeply in understanding the problem statement, rather than practicing the concepts explained in the course.
This remains as your task depending on your interests.
No need to overdo in my opinion.
About the quiz: if you make mistakes, he doesn't tell you what's wrong, he doesn't show you the right answer.
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
Because, honestly, the content of this course is not so hard and shouldn't be!
The course is comprehensive and the instructors have good teaching skills.
The level is introductory.
I would recommend this course to beginners with limited previous exposure to investment management.
Lector uses too many buzz words like "em", "am".
Every section has a different style of quiz, which is hard to prepare for.
That course is quite good to get the fundamental knowledge about power electronics
It would be better to see some more step by step examples.
The instructions for the final project were a bit cryptic - it was not completely clear what the instructor wanted.
It's Ok, nothing much to gain iin terms of knowledge realted to cyber conflict.
I may retake the course after I have a foundation.
Especially that the material is not easy to digest.
The material is very easy to follow.
There were too much math in the course.
This course was solid overall but not excellent.
I was really happy to join this class, until I saw there was no video learning, everything is articles.
Practical examples and hands-on exercises are very inadequate.
This was a kind of basic course without enough examples.
Good, but too slow at times considering it is just a high level view of basics.
Oh, and peer-reviewed grading, wherever possible, should be replaced with an auto-grader.
The assignments are hard for a person who has minimal computer skills as described in the outline, so having someone to go to for questions, especially the programming parts are essential and this is lacking unfortunately.
But I don't think this course is adapted for people who never heard about coding.
I liked you speak about accessibility and enjoyed making the quizz.
It involves a lot of GUI Concepts which may not be useful for general programmers.
I'm disappointed, however, that the course focused so heavily on Frederickson's work to the exclusion of others.
For myself, I feel I learned 1 set of concepts from the lectures and another set from the assignments by spending time on stack overflow and the pandas documentation.
Assignments should be evaluated for all users (unpaid ones as well) like it is done for other Wharton courses.
The course has fun illustrations and a high quality of production, but the lessons themselves don't dive very deep.
not so interesting and boring
I recommend doing th course, but strongly suggest the staff upgrade the lectures.
Thank you so much.
It should been shown the formula used, what is the threshold value to raise suspicion that manipulation might be present in the financials and also what are considered to be normal values.
Overall it is positive to see your offering but I think it can be improved and add a lot more valuable.
I wish you luck.
While I like the short videos for brevity, I would prefer to watch 10-15 minutes more content and really feel like the material was well covered.
The course material is good, and Casey always gives further reads and references.
And if you're not going to allow for a range of correct answers or formatting variances, then change all questions to multiple choice where there's (maybe) a fighting chance of passing.
There are many details don't explain clearly enough for a beginner to understand.
I wish that the representers find a more interesting and engaging way to teach grammar.
No hard homework, but you will be ready to work.
Hopfield Nets) or without going into much detail.
Talking talking talking, most if it without valuable content.
The assignments were perfect for beginners like me.
I find defining the question really impactful.
Web-standards in general also, html/css/js versions which just have new versions or upcoming versions should have been presented and/or relevant links provided.
This course if full of missed opportunities.
Swirl lessons are cool, but anyway they don't explain enough.2) I understand that studying is not always a joy, but lectures of this course are boring.
The course was just fine.
The course is excellent and cover many tasks that usually you perform with R. However, on my opinion assignments are not really focused on the topic of the classes, they are not really explained and above the grade of the classes.
The course was of great help.
It already is very useful, why not do better?
A better question is has the business change when the stock price drops.
All that might be fine for general education in a university context, but as someone who does want to understand Scala, but from a perspective of getting cool things done - that bit was a total waste of time.
Would be a better and shorter course if those 'didactic' bits were trimmed.
3 stars for the discussions which were left unanswered much of the time and not a highly active mentor group.
Programming assignments are of uneven difficulty.
Overall I enjoyed this course and got a broad overview of the various technologies used in big data analysis.
While there is much to learn in the lectures, the lecturers style is a bit halting and scattered (it would have been much better presented if the lecturer had a script to read off of.)
Robert Schiller has given a good start to understand financial markets which the course provided are informative.
The Swirl complemented and filled most of these gaps.
This course is just like a brief introduction, but not a course in college to teach student the real knowledge.
The text has quite a few exercises, but there is a tendency to throw in one or two problems whose difficulty is an order of magnitude above everything else in that section, and I find this discouraging and a waste of time.
As a result you need to alter and resubmit the assignments in order to meet all the grading criteria.3) The instructor repeats himself in the course videos.
I managed to get everything straightened out but it took some effort.
Needs to cover more material in a more engaging way.
I do see value in including this material in the specialisation but not as an outright course.
This course is designed as an in depth fundamentals of biostatistics where Professor Brain Caffo dives deep into some of the key formulas, origins of statistical formulas, and theoretical aspects of statistics.
Great lecture with valuable information, however, due to the lack of engagement within the lectures, it absolutely leave students who have no background of Calculus or Linear Algebra in the dust with no reference to assist them in the course.
Not practical enough
So I am a little disappointed.
Mostly, I had problems completing the assignments based on what I've learned during the lectures.
The previous courses had difficult assignments and you had to think about how you wanted to do something, here the problem was using the Spark API and understanding things which weren't explained in the lectures.
But when the research question is a question of the type "What it the IQR for income per state", for instance, the narrative can be very short: "IQR per state shows that the state with higher variability of income is...".
Although all the topics that are included are explained very beautifully.
I would really like a chance to speak to someone who can help me resolve my questions.
Poor quiz composition and monitoring by MOMA staff of discussion.
But it didn't, sometimes was very hard to go on with this.
The content is good and the examples are properly explained, but it probably doesn't warrant an entire course of its own
Give a good idea of how connectivity works.
Excellent for absolute beginners!
This is a very easy course, i would definitely recommend it to any beginner in HTML.
I should add that I have studied Buddhism, and there are so many better ways to provide people an opportunity to come into contact with this beautiful topic.
Knowledgeable professor.
I think the discussion on initiating and planning projects could be improved to be a bit more comprehensive and It would be great if the lecture slides were downloadable.
Overall a good course for self-study.
I liked the emphasis on the spoken language and the bullets on China and its culture.
The style of teaching does not really challenge or give insight.
The assignments had a lot of ambiguity.
Some of the lectures were too general, too fast, or left things outI also don't like the peer review type grading structureAlso, I am sure I'm not the only person taking this course (or the whole series), who does not CURRENTLY, have a career in healthcare; I am working towards that - So; to ask us to do a market sizing memo and come up with something from nothing, while swearing not to plagiarize, is not a good method.
I'm here to gain knowledge and skills - a broad overview.
Perhaps a course or actual 2nd degree in Health Info Tech or Healthcare Admin.
Good but many problems with platform... and help center not easy to access
I think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms.
Course materials are well organized.
Colleen is a great teacher and I like her unique teaching style and viewpoint.
There should be some reading material to assist learning.
I get it.
Content of the course is very good, useful and interesting, I greatly appreciate the knowledge delivered.
I had already done "Algorithms: Design and Analysis Part 1", so this course was not as good as that one.
This course had lot of programming questions, which I find very good to have for any course.
Maybe the course need to be two weeks to cover this properly.
1) quite academic assignments which are hard from the 1st one and are very far from regular programmer's job2) very quiet voice/record made it really-really hard to listen the course in subway/metro
For example, I spent a lot of time on the "Bubble detection" problem constructing graphs that allowed for multiple edges between two nodes, when it turned out that in order to pass I did not need to implement this.
That being said, I've learned a lot from the courses in this specialization, and thanks for the work put into it!
I realize that this is an overview of cancer but cancer cell biology and current treatment practices based on immunologic findings were not given the coverage they deserve.
The tasks are easy to perform.
The first week class was just super confusing without knowing the basic concept like vairable type declearation and the connection between different methods.
Good Luck!!
Some brilliant videos, but some leave much to be desired.
And it wasn't as if there were a lot of questions posted.
This creates the feeling of a bit of esoteric knowledge, or, what it is worse, a feeling of trial and error techniques, like the ones anybody can develop on his own... Also the total lack of exercises makes it a little bit boring to follow at times.
Other times, it was the blind trying to lead the visually-impaired.
On a positive note, you will use all of the skills from the previous courses: writing R functions, performing exploratory analysis and publishing it via RPubs.
This was a decent introduction to R, but my main issue is that the Data Science specialization is so dependent upon the R language.
I, for one, am more of an introvert; so this begs the question if the introverts will need to do something differently to be as effective as the extroverts such as Craig.
Grading system is not clearly defined at the time of submission.
However, a little more detail could have been provided while explaining a few concepts.
The quizzes are lame, the poetry selection is great, and the video lectures are all worthwhile.
I had initial misgivings about some of the videos.
This course is more suited for an academic rather than a PR campaigner.
In further lectures they go into tools of philosophy and major questions and arguments for them.
But you have to read the hand outs and have to work yourself through the course.
That said, I got something out of it using a self-directed approach.
In particular, sometimes the sessions were jumping from one discipline to another with not much explanation and this was confusing.
It would have been better that way, because I could review the strengths and weaknesses of the methods I used to get to the answer.
It's a very basic introduction.
Overall it seemed too easy and maybe a bit simplistic.
Very interesting course but also very technical.
This is just a pared down (worse) version of an older class, "Principles of Reactive Programming", which I started but didn't finish three years ago.
The overall information in this course was very informative and in some aspects rewarding as refreshers as where the mindset is with some population standards.
Only include very basic contents, doesn't need 4 weeks to finish this course.
lectures should be more detailed!
The course was interesting but it was clear that it is the first iteration.
good but i thought it will cover most of SAS technology.
It's better to focus on teaching key useful techniques to achieve desired effects
It does this very well by offering lots of references to research papers, articles and videos.
I liked how it contained specific examples and charts.
I would have been great to have more examples of the different types of corruption, the analysis to fight it and the solutions behind it.
Much time spent on examples.
Probably good for anyone coming from a non-programmer background.
If you're a programmer, can learn everything in a few hours just by looking at any Python tutorial.
Assignments are not good representations of course materials.
I missed several concepts to better understand some of the discussions and explanations.
I did pass the first few quizzes but I did not feel that I knew what I was doing.
This course lacks much explanation even on the basic logistics concepts and halfheartedly explains whats left.
If you're a more seasoned nutritionist, move on and find a more challenging course.
Great!
This course have excellent title but not that great contents.
At least show both in the leactures.
That's the best course of the entire specialisation.
Just a little improvement needed.
Institutions like Wharton, U. Michigan, U. Illinois, U. Virginia and Yale are packaging in their top courses/specializations at least 1.5 to 3 hours per module (what can have between 4 and 11 modules), plus resources - slides, readings, excel spreadsheets and others.
Interesting and informative, but the material seemed dated.
Many of the remaining lecture topics don't particularly link in to anything you'll be doing and are just "for interest's sake".
I have also taken Business Strategy also from University of Illinois and, in my opinion, the assignments are very well conducted and the make you think and go beyond the course info.
I think this is very important to address it properly because it is when the learner really acquire the knowledge, when he/she has to connect what he/she has learnt with real cases.
I also think the automatic grader should give an explanation or example of a correct answer when the assignment is answered correctly.
I found it way too condensed for introduction.
I believe it needs to be slowed down, extended - as it is.
The whole course took my around 6 hours to finish.
If not, you shouldn't bother - there's not much here.
though the flow of ideologies eventually became distinguishable, the comments on the several artists and philosophers noted were woefully uninformed and inadequate, even distorted, and the professor's eventual humming and hawing, irritating in the extreme, suggested that he was not at all prepared for his lectures - the final presentation of paintings without commentary at all was thus both a relief from his indecision and, at all of twenty minutes, an outrageous waste of time having left all of these however masterful works without any appreciable context
It could be more useful if you have no business background whatsoever.
I hope the specialization picks up after this point.
The lessons were kind of hard to understand.
this course is great in concept.
Brian tries to achieve too much in too little time.
It was an interesting class though the scale of difficulty was very low.
This is nice, few interesting ideas and tips.
Felt it was too based in USA information and some was not really conclusive.
However, there are lots of repetitive lectures and I think they could be grouped and summarized or even expanded for topics avoiding the repetitions.
I passed them with 100% credit, but I didn't feel I gained a lot useful knowledge through this exercise.
Bit too simple for my liking.
Even though there are examples, it should be more interactive with other videos rather than links of text.
But could have been great.
However, I did get a lot of coding experience.
It mainly revolves around ZMOT and best marketing analytics and data collection techniques and rawly around 30 minutes of content, and the last week was more of a "let's sum up".
The annotations of the different poems were great and taught me a lot about different poetic elements, but the lectures were unbearably corny with all of the different sound effects and bits.
Interesting, but not so much new things to know when you've already learned about healthy food.
The course itself highlighted some good ideas about saving time and prioritising, but the way it was presented just fell short for me.
This course is only useful if you have no experience visualizing data.
The Course was fine.
Good allround course with both theoretical and practical parts, because you now can buy a rather expansive certificate from taking the course the quizes are no longer available which is a shame.
Seemed very basic at the beginning and then got a lot more involved in the last week.
More theoretical.
It would be better to have a few shorter videos than to have one file of 30 to 60 minutes.
The course would be great if only everybody could fully participate.
I need something visual.
I wanted to get some basics of Python, but was rather disappointed by this course.
Need way more content, and accesibility to begginers, gap between theory and practical exercises is too big!
In contrast to previous fundamentals of quantitative modelling module, this lags in lot of areas.
Appreciate the efforts done by the team to design the Course in such a way that even a Beginner can learn.
Bad transcripts, for example: AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT COULD BE SERIOUS FOR LOCAL POPULATIONS AND THE GLOBAL COMMUNIST, THAT MEANS YOU – am I a global communist?
Could be in much greater depth.
I hoped it would be more of a challenge.
long lectures, hard to understand material.
Apparently, the instructor is well-informed in the history of the band.
Nevertheless, information is delivered in a huge portions, sometimes cluttered and it s easy to lost in the narrative.
Sound quality is bad (the volume is jumping sometimes and there is a lot of noise)May I suggest that you provide a short arts of songs you are talking about?I understand, there are copyright issues, but still, something should be done about it.
All in all, I wish to enroll in the second, improved release of this course
It has a good level, but there is room for improvement.
I'd hope the lectures will improve their presenting skills.
Another comment is the honours track assignments should really be put into more thoughts.
It seemed very general, even with the focus in the end on e-Types.
I liked the small portions this course was broken into, it made it all the more accessible.
I took this course hoping for a fundamental education in utilizing R for statistical analysis.
The metaphors, examples (ie "surely you've taken part in team sports like American Football") and tone really made it feel like the course was aimed not at me, but at men.
video.
Dr Sejnowski's skills are reading a teleprompter distracted me - I suggest doing some practice and redoing the videos when the TP won't be such a distraction (watching his eyes track back and forth didn't do it for me).
Thorough introduction in the world of strategic management for each and every one who is not familiar with this field of expertise.
A five-week class on biological mechanisms of perception of speech and music by humans.
It wasn't Exactly what I'd expected but was still a good course.
Examples are good.
Sadly there was no feedback at all from teachers...
This became important when professor Naveb interview another person in Hebrew, as I found I could not really trust the subtitles.
I think it wouldn't take much to make it an excellent course.
My cheeky suggestion is to have a specialisation with The Emergence of the Modern Middle East by Professor Asher Susser as nucleus and a series of shorter, more in depth courses on certain of the bigger countries, such as Egypt, Turkey and Iran, similar to this one on Israel.
But overall I thought the course was very informative on the concepts of how infections can spread and how we can track the movements in order to help control infection rates.
Assignment grading had a lot of technical hurdles.
If courses like this are to be continuously supported by Coursera clients/students, this kind of feedback is critical.
Still, very interesting lectures and good talks.
And in addition, it might be both more inspiring and more attracting if the lecturer giving the information with more spoken presentation which approaching to a real class rather than a fixed script text.
It's nothing really new and fundamental for this specialization.
It's a very nice course but it is very small.
Great informative course
short, effective and precise, contain all necessary for a initial learner about Business Model Canvas.
Interesting concepts and introduction to the specialization but I wish the lectures were more natural and energetic.
The course is way to basic and easy.
Content was a bit shallower than expected.
Two of the weeks' content was not based on specific, cited research, which was disappointing.
please the instructor and mentor check QA and answer them timely.3.
Too many information to understand in 3 weeks of courses, Ruby, Rails, Gem, Bundle, Rspec, Unit Test, Black Box Test, and Food2Fork, Heroku.4.
the peer graded assignment is too difficult for non-native speakers of English
While this topic is interesting, and course goes over some examples.
Skills acquired when finishing this first course are very useful and applicable.
This is a course that would be helpful to complete programming novices.
The course structure was well formatted.
That could be a bias of mine, as I have done quite a bit of management-type work, so maybe it didn't feel that new or informative.
I was mostly interested in the music and related culture, but I will be interested to read some of the books that were discussed.
After many hours of work, many failed first attempts and countless hours of eating comfort food, I eventually reached week 13.
The first round of the capstone was separated in time by about 6 months from the initial courses, so the lack of additional material was rough.
Listening to Tucker Balch talk is a pain.
I loved this course.
formulas within the spreadsheets) were immensely small and we could not see the formulas therein.
someone needs to come up with a better way to explain these concepts so that they are not so jumbled.
Good foundation, but very basic.
The content is very less.
very much interesting and hand on map of yourself or your hobby.
Propose more exercises that goes up in incremental content and difficulties and allow students to get more practical insight upon how a blockchain really works.
In sum, I encourage the faculty to take this course to the next level by incorporating situational cases and how sales people of a wide range of personalities have handled difficult sales situations successfully, and/or how someone else have handled them unsuccessfully.
A very nice warming session that stirs awareness into food, nutrition and health.
No slides are provided for preview and review.
It took more like 8 or 9 hours of problem solving and debugging and having to try different things and there was one every week so it became pretty frustrating as it really ate into my weekend.
Good quick introduction.
Also the readings were important and added value to the learning experience.
On the other hand there are - in my opinion some aspects that made this course a not so rich experience.
Mostly a guide for teachers bringing classes to MOMA; weak otherwise.
very simple and basic ideas of growing a business.
You have to carefully go through hours of instructions.
Each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations.
Interesting, and helpful.
Overall a very helpful overview, but I would have liked to spend more time coding.
Overall it's a good intro if you know nothing or very little about those topics.
That said, the class is too slow.
Homework is too easy and boring.
Make the tests longer and more difficult.
Good as introduction, but pretty basic for me.
However, participation and feedback by others was really limited.
I learned quite a lot that I can use for research, personal projects, and general understanding of neural networks, but unfortunately this course is getting quite out of date at this point.
The course is interesting much to be learned and topics are open to much discussion.
That lecture might have made more sense in purely written form, and I wonder if it was so daunting that it scared off some of the students who started the course.
As a whole, the course managed a satisfying balance between discussion of the poetry itself and discussion of the social and economic contexts in which the poetry was created and consumed.
A surface level look into creating a SQL database with Python.
However, it's reasonable when there is a big and varied audience on coursera because not everyone can hear a quick speech.
The course was really great!
Really worth the time to go over the lectures several times.
The programming assignments however lack instructions and the online judgement system has some strange requests which are not illustrated in the instruction.
It was hard to even understand the basic ideas of what was required for an assignment.
I think the teacher very much needs to go back and change the wording of the assignments, add more information in the instructions, and also post an example to show what is expected since a lot of the assignments are very strange, like a describing a character without mentioning the character in any way.
Inspiring and Motivating Individuals did an excellent job of that, as did two of the four weeks of this course.
The assignments and practice exercises need to be tougher.
Could use more details or pointers to reading materials to help understand the concepts better
This course is extremely basic.
Learnt a lot but it wasn't fun and the course material needs work in my opinion.
But the most negative aspect was not having the slides.
I enjoyed the topic.
However, the assessments could have been better structured so as to be more challenging and a better diagnostic tool for learners.
I'd like to have practice tasks during the course not only the final one
Decent Introductory course for someone who is a newbie.
This means you spend more than 50% of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so.
I would recommend this course, but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future.
Ancient Greeks is brief overview of Greek civilization from about 1800 to 320 BC, starting with the Minoans of Crete and ending with the death of Alexander the Great.
The format and structure of this class needs some improvement.
Have a programming exercise to complete at the end of every week to prove you have understood the material taught, a quiz alone with 10 or less questions is not enough.
The assignments in particular are excellent for data cleaning, analysis and interpretation.
Similarly, many of the non-Buddhist guided meditations that I viewed in this course felt like a physical education or "How To" class.
Interesting concept and great insight into the workings of a research project, yet limited in scope, effectively the long term effects cannot be proven on evidence and the practical feasability of the ideal seems to be rather limited.
I would suggest the Teaching team to use R/python scikit instead of Java
With no recourse, I was prevented from passing although my overall percentage of points earned was passing.
I also felt the chapter on the 4th cent.
Also, given that this course is taken by students from all over the globe, it should mention that the "serial comma" is not mandatory in all writing styles.
However, there are also a few shortcomings of the course.
Pretty good in overall, but there are a few points that could be improved:- The content is taught in a weird order and the difficulty doesn't increase steadily.
Very helpful but sometimes it is too slow
I would however, change the final quizzes, which rely too much on one essay rather than on the videos or on other reading material.
Or just running already wrote code like in the last section?
The teacher is somewhere higher than the students (not necessarily at the top, if there is such a thing).
The job of the teacher is to throw boxes (concepts) and balls (details) of different size, shape and colors.
Missing key examples and explanation of so many terms a good try though I appreciate their effort to provide free knowledge.
When the user finally submits the assignment it fails and the grader gives misleading error messages.
Nicely outlined and broad in scope, but Brian's presentation is kind of dry.
While reviewing I realised some people made very simplistic stuff like me after following instructions, while others with more design experience created really amazing stuff.
My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though.
In addition, the quizzes were far too easy.
All the information provided in the lectures is research-based and Dr. Brooks states clearly when she is providing information which needs further investigation or clarification.
Interesting online course as introduction with brief concepts and definitions on diplomacy, its role, influence and interaction in the modern world.
I had to watch all of them on x2 playback speed to not die of boredom.
Some of the lecture content also seemed years behind the times -- like the omission of any mention of the increase in terrorist attacks in Western Europe.
The lectures are good and clear, with many concrete examples and exercices to train.
Also, it would be helpful to be referred to a relevant text book.
The course feels rushed.
If you're just trying to get started learning WebApps, as I was, this is very useful.
The reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was that there weren't very useful assignments.
Given the untimely and low quality of peer feedback on the first assignment, I didn't feel like I'd learn anything from completing and submitting any assignments.
Also for both slides and assignments the notations were not always consistent and/or variables disappeared from equations without clear explanations.
I hope in the next offering of this course there will be improvements on these aspects.
The reading, was surprisingly different (week 4 activity would be more suitable here) and really hard to access to someone, who hasn't done much reading in theories of knowledge etc.
It is good where there are them, but not so good where there isn't.
I for one have a camera that I want to learn to use more professionally.
Great part of the content is about mediation, arbitration and negotiations that are not sucessfully.
I am glad I took it.
good closing course but peer reviewing and no prof is little untraditional.
It could be much better.
The class was informative, but the delivery of the material was less appealing.
The final assessment somewhat not really well designed, imho.
Actually learning course gives me no pleasure.
I think last week was too complex and not that exciting.
Overall, thank you for setting up this course
The reason I took to this course was to get a better, high-level understanding of construction project management and planning, however, the Job Logic assignment expected that I would know what all is involved in the technical workings in construction (i.
e.
Interactions, live examples could have been added in the content.
Especially the video background is not good.
The experience is old LMS not MOOC like..
Decent course.
It was good but i felt the last two weeks like stuffing content.
Grader can reject solutions, e.
g.
Professors are very good , i am really enjoy in this class, but no further discussion about implementing ML algorithm, just call the API to handle the sort of data.
I spent hours figuring out what's going on.
I spent too much time trying to figure out what the autograder wanted and not enough time learning Data Science with Python.
Lots of theory but includes some useful models and formulas
This course is mis-titled.
This is a good course to get you thinking about your future classroom.
Well, after the regression course, which I actually found interesting, the classification course doesn't look so good.
Very difficult to figure it out.
But this is also a drawback.
Probably, I wouldn't have a course just about how to hire/build a data team.
A very well-done introduction to Design Thinking
The errors and missed references to tables and equations from part one of the book to the other are too many.
Having said that, I have never learned so much about a topic.
It's good that students get to interact among themselves and learn on their own, but every single post should be either answered by a TA to clarify doubts or they should acknowledge that another student's explanation was good enough to answer a particular question.3.
The course is a bit too basic, I expected to get deeper information about healthy eating than this course suggests.
I'm on the first real module now and the change in difficulty is quite significant.
Well the course is reasonably well organized the material is in great detail exceeding what I would've thought the overview concept of big history would be.
Let's talk about calculus."
A better presenting style would improve the course no end, but ultimately, what is covered is what you need.
Which is better suited for what task?
Course could be better
too philosophical
Should have talked about how German and other European industries used forced labour for their benefit.
Did force me to start getting familiar with gitHub.
I would have like it if they could provide free graded assessment to non-certificate students; and make option for certification
This is an extremely basic course.
Prof Adelstein's analogies and video lectures are amazing otherwise
Keep up a good work!!
The course was very overpriced given the amount of information offered compared to other courses I have taken at coursera.
Thanks.
Still not bad as long as you know what you are going into.
These are new concepts for people so it may be difficult to grasp right away.
A good introductory course for the specialization track but useless as a unique course.
I have enrolled myself in the other Machine Learning courses offered by Uwash , but have to say this was not properly organized.
The materials of the course are very good, and the presentation is of high quality.
A drawback is the lecturer seams follows too close to the slides, so that he looks like reading the written words only.
This course was a let down.
If you are going in expecting to learn nuances of creating effective wireframes and mockups, you will be disappointed.
The lectures are harder to follow, and are actually all about bioinformatics algorithms, which wasn't clear from the course description.
A little more interactive activity would have been nice.
This course has more interesting material than the previous one (Landscape) but again, the assignments are based on theoretical essays than on practical tasks (case analysis etc).
The professors need to go into more detail with JavaScript.
very compressive , not long enough and still there is many info i didn't get !!
I don't like that the 3 and 4 star reviews are missing!Coursera seems to sometimes remove reviews with lower numbers of starts.
I thought that this course was going to be mostly on the brain, but it wasn't at all.... just a small section.
If your main interest is in vision then it might be different, but for me being interested only in how vision relates to the brain, there was very little useful information in this course for me.
It does not teach how to do calculations to decide a specific SAA, how to pic stocks, how to make decisions in real life.
This was a good introductory course, with some very informative video and instruction.
nice course but i did not recieved my certificate yet
I took this course before when everything was still free... too bad I can only audit the course now.
I know that one takes to the other, but I only had time to finish the first and understand.
The course experience was a little bit weird.
If all the videos had been of good listenable quality I would have given the course 5 stars
A big improvement on the first course.
moreover the lectures are not comprehensive.
As a result, every week I spent several hours on the fora and stackoverflow to figure out what the autograder wants, instead of actually learning pandas.
there are complicated topics with weak background for the students.
except that it is a great course.
I will admit there were times I was lost on the quizzes because the videos weren't clear enough.
It is more Software Project Management than Software Product Management.
The attendants might already have a good foundation of econometric and probability statistics before taking this course.
The content is useful, but too verbose.
Will review it once again to renew some ideas.
Relevant, to the point and natural presentations
its not bad, but its not great either..
the teacher's passion for music may overcloud his jugment..
It felt like there were a lot of jumps between basic statistical formulae and abstractions thereof.
Where to start on budgeting, and how to go about developing some of these specific business aspects.
But whatever syllabus was there in this course it was clearly explained
I didn't feel like I learned much.
The material is not presented in a cohesive manner.
Looks like authors may invest more time and passion to it.
This level of detail was good for easier statistical concepts but there are much better courses on Coursera for Machine Learning
I had to leave the course before completion because of that.
A simple vision of project management principles
I think it would be better to use more material from professional manuals, not from "trendy" websites.
Prefer more challenging course on this topic.
The Instructor speaks too fast.
Just showing examples of some good projects and their code at most part of the course .
Also comparing Meteor with Wordpress is wrong and I don't think Meteor will reach Wordpress.
After all they are different tools for different jobs.
I'd encourage some refinement of the quizzes, for clarity purposes.
I mean the level of toughness of questions is not too good to compete any coding competition.
However I'm also extremely bored watching the videos because looking at the lectures reading the scripts (most of the time with very slow speed) is one of the quickest way to send people to sleep.
very fundamental, but the instructor is tiresomely talkative...
for example, when he talked about examples, he compared each two numbers again and again, what I want to is the logic to find the max/min number, not 49 is larger than 9!!
This was a very basic foundation course on data careers and business metrics.
I had to use the 1.5x or 2x speed all the time, and I'm not native English.- The format of the slides is really ugly (e.
g., those bullet points in the code)- No lecture notes are provided- The references are to his (expensive) books instead- No source code of examples is provided either- Graph theory is interesting, but out of scope.
Easy to comprehend but far too basic to be helpful and I don't feel I received an "Understanding of financial statements" because the course was too rudimentary.
Too basic.
Course has good breadth and structure, exploring the economic and political side of international energy, however it would be good if a basic technical understanding of energy is incorporated.
Some material is rather outdated / inaccessible
Some videos seems to be cut of too early and week's 6 videos are out of order, which is annoying.
Overall it's an okay overview of the topic for someone who is unlikely to apply it at daily job (e.
g.
Could have been more thorough in applying the content to examples similar to the quiz.
He basically reiterates what is written on the slides and doesn't expand on it much or at all.
Course content was interesting.
For example, the exactly same solutions that was passed by the autograder as correct previously are graded as incorrect in the next trial.
It was inspiring though
It was a rerun and there wasn't much help in the Forum and there were too few exercises.
OK, but not really in-depth.
Although the topics were of great interest to me, the videos were not as engaging.
Having said that, i think this is a wonderful starter course to get a glimpse of what Machine Learning is all about.
The content was interesting, but it was too much theory, sometimes a bit borring
I had rated the course earlier but would like to amend my statement.
I liked how they made us work on them instead of the first course where we were mostly tuning parameters.
It was very slow to take off, especially week one.
It often felt like values and questions were arbitrary.
The lectures in this class are well done and informative, and they provide a lot of good material.
I learned a lot about the etic and emic perspective on depression, and his insights about sociocultural factors are amazing.
It was monotonous.
As as standalone course on machine learning, it's probably best to take Andrew Ng's class on Coursera.
This is very much a primer.
The structure is odd; the last week contains more material than the rest of the course put together.
I only expected more excercices.
Good for getting familiar with switch mode converter circuits.
Right now, the coding implementation and the algorithm explainations are mixed together in a way that is not really easy to digest.
However, I really appreciate the solid content of this course.
For the rest of us, this course provides some helpful tips and techniques.
This new format within Coursera (everything shorter, more expensive and with less people involved) is not as good as the original one.
Sometimes the audio of the recordings is poor, making it difficult to listen.2.
It was the students helping each other through the forums.
Overall, I found this course to be a good refresher given my prior knowledge / skill base.
this course need some odifications because of cloudera version
Unfortunately, this course focuses heavily on statistical methods and very little on explaining the R processes used.
That being said, I struggled with the GraphX hands on exersizes, where many of the Scala commands simply hung.
).
I really like the problem sets, but some of the lectures are pretty rough, just a guy talking in front of some pseudocode for 10 minutes.
The content is very similar to the Marketing analytics in practice one
Instead of interviewing different people, it could have animations and infographics to explain the research methods.
It was too easy for me.
There are a few questions which are not covered in the video lecture (or covered in later weeks).
The later portions could have been better although they weren't that bad either.
The format and the examinations can be definitely improved.
It was nice, considering the messages and the amount of time.
I also noticed a lot of repetition from the course before.
Course was good, nice introduction to data science and its branches.
Some of the links are no longer functioning and thus, gaining access to exact information for the past (2013) is not possible.
The course is very general and high level introduction.2.
Lectures and the homework are not quite relevant.
The exercises need more work done if the students are expected to actually learn this stuff.
Requires some MATlab intuition.
Given the nature of law courses (a lot of reading), there needs to be a great deal more written information on the lecture slides.
Although the course offers a very wide range of subjects and also additional recommendations for reading, the basic didactic material superficially explores the work of each artist.
Annoyingly, the specific pre-requisites can't be determined until AFTER enrolling.
Anyway, it is not as valuable as I expected from the beginning.
Some videos are 4 minutes long, so more than half of the content is not actually content, it is essentially the instructor reading the outline for the upcoming content.
straight and narrow.
The course is pretty good for a beginner.
But it emphasis too much on using third party authoring tools and proper coding is not implemented.
The required code is auto-generated and we as learners are only asked to make few changes on the already existing code.
Too much history
This course had a lot of valuable information but in the quizzes it was only the most basic questions asked.
However, as I would go through the written material, I would try to work the problems given as examples, and when they did not work, I was confused and wondered why the example given to teach us would not work.
Without help from other programmers and googling a lot I could not have done this.
I think it would be better if more of the reading was available to people.
Moreover, it is implemented with even a more sophisticated and better desiged structure.
Intuition on the models that we derive is not there.
Good base to start building a site
This course is really, well, introductory.
Very complex for beginners.
I know Ruby and Python but R is a very peculiar language itself.
Couple of Assignments are tough and there will be very little help to complete it but nevertheless it will keep you interested in the course.
If you can get past that, it's a good course and the professor knows his stuff.
The content could have digged deeper a bit more and the assignments could have been harder.
One question asked "why" and the answer was literally "because that's how that algorithm is".4.
Few presenters were not much interesting.
It is a good refresher for those with an analytics background, but also puts things in a perspective from a business setting which is good for when you are working in the field.
Many of the answers I read were just repetitions of what was learned in class.
I never thought that learning about Hitler and the origins of the Holocaust would become an interest, but it's really great!
Eg.
I truly love the course program and what it covers.
I could get some inspiration and learning, but i thought it was to short.
The materials are good, but it felt like this class should have a been a 1-week introductory lesson to Data Science.
Clear and very interesting.
It frequently seemed students did not read submissions, off handedly grading.
The exercises are well conceived covering fairly realistic use cases and are of about the right complexity.
I also thought that the final assignment instructions were a bit confusing.
This course remind me so much of course done by Wesleyan University - Social Psychology, by great profssor Scott Plous.
Maybe have an assistant?Otherwise, like I said, I did learn a lot and I do appreciate it.
The other reviewers had no problems, luckily.
There is almost no help to be found in the discussion forums, which seems pretty buggy.
The project is too unguided, you can set an example by creating a sample website throughout the course.
increase the difficulties
However, a lot of it is writing your own tool kits, assuming you already have successful sales experience.
It's actually hard to understand what the underlying requirements are at first read - from about Week 3 onwards.
In my case, I am working as a full-time while I am taking this course.
Intensive learning.
It would have been nice to have had some concrete examples of balanced Nordic meals.
Very informative but at times too technical
The topics in this course is worth exploring using your own time.
less hands-on exercises and this course covers too much topics without details.
However, the course is quite short and doesn't have much in-depth content.
However, I was expecting a more indepth elaboration of techniques.
The information is good, but basic.
But if you don't know Ruby and Rails at all this is a good place to start.
Overall decent course on an important and relevant topic.
So, all in all, I really do like this course, but instructions aren't always super clear.
I can use different tags to make the page look similar to the professors layout, and not be exact in what's required.
Example is to download the text files in the final assignment the command wget is invaluable.
Thank you.
right?
The pomodoro technique is nice to know about, though I have rarely used it so far.
No really what I expected.
I am not sure whether it will be useful in a real life, especially calculating Chi-squared and such.
However, I rate it only with three starts because I think it is too basic for the complexity involved in real research.
The recommended e-book is almost a transcript of the lectures' examples, and I really recommend getting it (I got it on print, as I like to make annotations while following the videos).
That being said, the Programming Assignments are extremely difficult for anyone with no programming background.
You are ateacher full of passion, and I actually learnt a lot from you and your course.
This is reflected at times when reading the transcript below each video.
Hard to keep track where one was.
Can be better in terms of information and assignments.
As a comparative novice in the field, I'm not sure that I am now able to apply independently what I imitated for the assignments.
But the material is competently presented and covers the material it is advertised to cover.
Learning some of the radicals and simple words would make this course much more valuable.
Problems were also very simple and not very challenging.
I think this course is to basic.
Hi, I loved this course.
Once you complete the weekly quiz and PASS it, you don't see the worked out solutions for the weekly quiz so that you can review.
Come on guys.
The instructor should spend more time putting equations and concepts into concept, and tying them together.
Most of the times the material was very well explained, and I like the concept of the tutor writing on the screen at the same time they are presenting, personally it helps me more.
Nevertheless, this is a decent introductory course if you are looking to know a slice of Philosophy.
An amazing course to get a brief understading about Big Data, the course needs an improvement in the slides, and additional resources for better understading.
For those who are already familiar with basic nutrition, most of this course may be a review for you but there's some good information and facts to take away.
But it looks like the authors themselves made the course in one weekend.
Its an awesome course.
Could benefit from harder assignments or more
Interesting content, well structure lessons but too easy assesments.
I would have wanted more discussions with cohorts taking the class to help cement the practices by virtue of seeing it from other perspectives in different work environments.
The lectures on brain plasticity and such I found largely irrelevant to the subject matter.
The accent of this teacher made me struggle to comprehend some of the most basic concepts she was presenting.
While I appreciated the challenge of the capstone project, I didn't feel like the assignment's requests accurately aligned or represented what was provided in the lecture series.
However it lacks more details on the mechanics, under the hood functioning of Blockchains.
The practical assignments are not adequate.
Great content, but not delivered in a very dynamic manner so hard to stay attentive.
Of course there must be guessing questions too but not too much.
The final quizs need some simplification in the structure or format.
Overall, I still recommend people taking this course.
Could be improved by increasing the level of complexity.
Although, I found the pace was a bit fast, only covered enough to get by, not gradually building up to a point.
This made it challenging to utilize the applications to the full extent.
The teacher is not good for expression.感觉老师表达能力有所欠缺，听起来很吃力，说话语速很不流畅，应该要好好改进一下。真想退款了
To the course staff, please update the slides where Python2 is used to python3.
Thank you for our instructor for nice presentations.
Nevertheless, I would expect more about pharma and treatment apporaches.
I feel that you could have offered a more detailed description .
The lack of contact details for course queries is concerning as is purely being assessed by peers who may not follow the grading guidelines very well (providing no feedback etc)
I am giving a 3-star rating as i) the lectures need to be updated with correct data or need to provide guidance as to when one should expect individual difference when following along with the notebook, ii) instructor / mentor response in the discussion forums is lacking, iii) graphlab is now an outdated tool as it is not commercially available.
It takes much more time to watch the reading of the slides than just to read them.
Disappointed that it's all theory and no application.
Final part of course is trying to work with hadoop using virtualbox and provided virtual image.
Who teaching us is a student, and the assignment is not in detail as other class
However the final project required to utilize a combination of all new learned material on a whole different level of difficulty compared to the preceding quizzes.
Needs more material about parsing, semantics and syntactically correct language.
Instructors took to long to get to the point half-way through the course.
Good information overall, but the "peer graded" assignment at the end is poorly designed and seems unnecessarily arbitrary.
horrible experience.
For beginners it is good.
I can understand the temptation by the course developers to include a section on SQLspark, as this is a very powerful set of spark libraries, but I believe it is beyond the prerequisites.
The absolute worst of it was the full recommendation for using analogies but with no attempt on explaining how to make *good* anaologies.
This course might be good for someone who has no previous knowledge of the nutrition content of food or how to cook.
Inviting different speakers makes the course more diverse.
Areas of improvement:1) Design.
Of course, many of their opinions are valid, but I wouldn´t accept those views as solid rock statements because they are not.
In any case, I recomend the course for people with obesity problems and those who are too lazy to think about the importance of home cooking.
The quality of the videos is outstanding!
Chris is great at explaining things in an accessible manner, and I'm very much looking forward to going into more detail in the rest of the specialisation.
The course takes a broad approach to the subject.
What I miss: the study material should provide more and better organized (theoretical) information (e.
g.
No prior experience required.'
I don't like the fact you have to pay 80 dollars just to unlock assignment submissions.
I did enjoy this course, but at times I felt a little bored, like it was loosing my interest.
Excellent further reading sections at the end of each module.
If there were none included then this is not acceptable when discussing science in an academic context.
If you can't manage through this course, don't feel like you aren't smart enough to complete it; rather, you just don't have the proper pre-requisites.
For others it could be less informative.
Not worth it for the money, but go for it if you want to complete the entire specialization
Just bare essentials , can be found online in other places for free
Should have been a complete course.
It can be made more informative on theory side.
A bit odd this one.
A bit less engaging than the other parts of the Executive Data Science course.
and the other point, please revise the Cloud Computing quiz as it focused on dates and history rather than focusing on the core of the subject.
Having to do peer reviews is also not ideal.
There is a lot of space to improve this course.
Although it's still possible to follow the videos, I think it would make it easier to update some things a little bit.
I liked every course in this specialization except
Relevant and well organized material when looking at it, but in total it is way too thin.
However, many of the analogies used are childish and cheesy, I think.
Good learning materials, however the assignments are designed for compute science students rather than professional software developers as the most important part of the assignments is not parallel code, but it is algorithms.
quick intro of html css & js; but not deep enough to get more pro on it
For me, for an introductory and theoretical course I expected more resources, for example additional suggested readings, optional exercises...
Lectures are well structured (intro and summary at the end), but I have missed presentations from some of the most interesting videos (week 6).
A bit short and not very technical, but playing with Type as an integral part of design was really fun and inspirational.
This course provided a good introduction to SQL for me as a beginner and through challenging lessons forced me to learn SQL basics.
Too easy, please do not repeat the same thing three times, it's just a waste of time and I'm not stupid.
I didn't have time to even notice it.
The topic itself is a little limited, mostly to finance, whereas there would be so much more equally interesting diversity in data to analyse.
After doing a great Deep Learning course by Google on another platform, this one was a huge disappointment in that regard.
It's very general information.
I somewhat feel that the content on those courses is twice or thrice more.
Lets not forget that if it's pure math we can follow PEMDAS, however when we have text formulas it's a bit confusing.
I understand that a lot of content is covered within a month, but there should be supplementary course material available.
It was surprising that the "pivot tables" was never mentioned in this course.
A lot of interesting questions were raised - enough to lead me to view the course in a rather positive light.
You will say "you can reduce the speed" but this would reduce the sound quality too.
But the exercises and tests are really easy and do not require lots of knowledge.
Hope that the next courses will be at the same level!Two main problems, though: first, the autograder is very bad, should be much more flexible.
Second, in my opinion, the homework should be more code-based, just like the final project.
The content was good.
Teacher and mentors gave hints on the discussion forum which helped.
As is, the lectures are mediocre, which is unfortunate since the lecturer is clearly knowledgeable about the topics presented.
Second, the assignments suffer from a lack of good error messaging and no support in the forums (aside from what you will find from other students, which can be very helpful at times.)
I even found myself USING the new knowledge in real world problems.
Very much academic-oriented.
Great course
I want to give it 3 1/2 starts - sometimes the modules seem really segmented and you spend half the time repeating the same ideas or recapping the course material (that was new that week!
But overall a great overview of monitoring software and the importance of understanding your audience.
Overall, the course is worth the effort and time if you are interested in the history of photography and its most notable practitioners.
before discussing genetic mutations occurred in Alzheimer disease that mentioned when discussing AIS, i think some refreshment about protein synthesis and the normal pattern that if disturbed by certain ways as mutations causes particular diseases.
some arrangements of material needed to prevent information overlappinginteresting courses, go onthanks for your efforts dear professors
While I don't think it was inappropriate for a course on statistics in itself, it felt rather out of place in the rest of the sequence of this course.
I think the basis of calculus has to come from rigorous definitions of the concepts involved and firm understanding of the proofs.
In some videos, the instructor was hard to understand and I had to turn on closed captions.
Unsure why there is this endorsement for the Illustrator when there is other good and cheaper software avail.
Interesting review of many of the theoretical aspects.
There's no specific grading rubric - so points allocation is random and based on your peer's assessment.
An sometimes it is hard to apply to the practice.
Moreover, it is nice to add the course with notes in pdf format because to listen or watch video lectures is not convenient.
Not bad by the now
Maybe it is my fault, but I waited for something else, this was my first philosophy and mindfulness course.
One concern is that Python installation steps are covered in every week's classes which is redundant one.
Very nice, interesting but videos are too long comparing others courses.
The depth and explanation of theoretical concepts are better than the first course.
Some might say too simple.
Questions and asignments holds high quality.
If you haven't been in contact with Python before, this might be the first step for you, and when I say first step, then I really mean first step.
A good course.
i also do not see unsupervised learning to be covered.
A very short introduction but a good idea
From my poitn of view more lessons are needed, achieving exercises require a deep search on stackoverflow and other courses.
This course was mostly self learning.
A colleague once took a course online (through another platform).
After four courses in a row I was expecting much more skills rather than theoretical discussions all the way long.
Bad form on coursera for making you pay to submit assignments that are autograded to begin with.
Interessante, porém poderia ser melhor elaborado.
This course is interesting, but could be better elaborated.
Good but need more practise problems in order to understand what you are learning
The lecture videos taught me a lot and I was happy I got to use whatever I learned in the final project.
Why shouldn't we stay consistent in pseudocode using index starting with either 0 or 1?
The result is that the projects you get to review are of very disparate levels.
The assignments are not very clear.
Further in the course description is a blurb that may point to at least 3 future courses in "Mahāyāna, …Vajrayāna, …and a fourth vehicle, which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Post Tantra”."
Thanks
If I could suggest a change in this course, it would be to consider all the different backgrounds of the people taking the course, and give examples that are more inclusive.
This is a great intro to machine learning, but it needs to be polished and updated.
I would prefer a more in depth approach (for the advanced), or more exercises for those getting familiar with spreadsheets.
A little too superficial and hand waving.
I am not one of them.
Needs clear instructions
Don't expect to really learn something significant.
Final assignment was good.
Information about the course was sparse.
I expected a lot under Monte Carlo Simulation.
The lecturers are very knowledgeable and are very good teachers.
Interesting topics, however, still basic
I would like more content from this module.
i dont want to know the history of language and the pendulum swing i just want a list short and simple in a single 20 min video and move one.
Not much of a course, I understand why it exists, but it's basically just getting setup with the environment.
Course feels somewhat abandoned by instructors.
It is a good course, however, I would have liked deeper knowledge in git
This course took me three months of several hours of work a week to complete.
Most of the assignments require student guesswork, writing functions not covered in the lecture.
Overall I enjoyed it and it was good as a hand-hold through the pre-Socratics and some of the most essential Platonic writings.
Pros: the videos are pretty easy to understand, and the material chosen/covered is good to know.
Cons: the video quiz questions are really...
dull...
and there are too many.
But for experience people there is nothing new in this course.
I would really appreciate if1) the target audience is mentioned in a course it would be really helpful2) what a person would achieve after completion of a course .
This course is comparatively easy
It is intresting Course
Most concepts were glanced over, for someone without prior experience the material would be too demanding but for people with experience (e.
g.
I'll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing.
Books and Videos on these subjects are all over Amazon, YouTube, FPMT, Dharma-Documentaries, etc.#2.
Course itself is interesting, but cases need to be updated.
While the textbook used in this course provide a lot of useful background to the Internet, it's history and trends...
etc All good knowledge.
I would not recommend this as a first look at the Dialogues, however.
I have some programming experience, but I often could not understand the questions being asked in the programming assignments.
It is a decent introduction, but has very little content.
The programming assignments are a great way to get your hands dirty with R, but this is not a course for someone without any prior programming experience, and I found the lectures didn't have much connection with the assignments.
And the project is done in Matlab, so you end up wrestling with Matlab or Octave instead of actually doing and learning.
The material is excelente, But I would like you to promote a little more the community.
Not difficult course but teaches you much about Java
A very quick overview of finance.
Nothing is mentioned about childhood cancers or the area of lymphomas.
But first part, with introductions and definitions were very "heavy".
While I enjoyed this course and learned quite a bit, I think the strong leaning of the content toward use of materials for educational purposes should be made much clearer in the class title and description.
This course seems to require a high level of foundation knowledge that I don't have.
The angular content is pretty good and helpful, though.
Could be more useful with more background information on ADA and IDEA and everyday implications.
I wouldn't recommend this course to a beginner at all.
Others are good.
The videos are really boring, however the course is good.
Could be put together a lot nicer.
Interesting and useful to a degree, but I was looking for something a little more challenging.
However along the course there is valuable information provided.
Exercise sources are not up to date, I have come across many problems.
It is a pity that the legal framework is almost exclusively focused on the US.
This class is the best of the three in the specialization because Mike Spears does a pretty good job with the sections he teaches.
Having said that, if you want to go deeper into the psychology of memory this course is probably not for you.
In my opinion, the course is too basic.
I had to rely on course forums and a lot of googling to finish the course successfully.
a little bit easy, I guess this course is for the beginners.
A good introductory course.
I did find the course a little 'bitty' compared to other courses I have completed through Coursera, and the assignments were not very clearly structured.
That said I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid introduction to this area.
I paid for the certificate since the idea of a "specialization" appealed to me, but I am not sure it was worth.
It says you need 3 hours for this assignment but I could finish it after two days (and I am good in programming).
Great course overall.
needed more depth, which still could have been achieved in a 1-week format
They are not subject matter expert and they tried to deliver their best.
This limited my ability to went through the course on time - I "attend" Coursera courses using my iPhone while commuting and it is not possible for this course.
The title created too many expectations
I got the feeling that we ran through the material and did not spend ample time setting up the testing and understanding the environment.
relative low efficiency to learn
You spend way more time looking for resources about how to answer the quiz questions than the lectures will take to review.
I really like the fact to show the weakness to understand what are the requirements of a secure PRF, PRP & co!Optional programming assignments are really interesting unfortunately they take too much time to do and lack of guidance as it could be the case for the famous ML course.
Large topic and well presented.
There should me more topics on secure code review methods
Useful overview for the specialization....
not sure it's the best overview of software product management outside of that context.
Still very helpful.
However, I believe someone learning English or reviewing academic writing would definitely benefit from going through this course.
The material seems very arbitrary and even with a basic knowledge of machine learning, and advanced mathematics it is difficult to understand the first week and the types of neurons presented, understanding which is essential I think.
Thus, many of the quiz questions are on comprehending passages from cases, statutes, or commentary.
It is very simple.
Lengthy lists are presented, however, I need to pause the video if I want to know anything that's on the list beyond the first two points.
I seem to see the professor on screen more then important information we need to take note of.
It could be improved by updating the audio recordings, and correcting the translations for the subtitles
This capstone course could be improved with the addition of supervisory staff/project mentors.
If you know programming of any other languages, you can spend a few hours and quickly finish this course.
They do learn you about validation.
it is a good beginner course with lots of detail.
Thanks however for putting the effort and making this available to everyone for free.
Good introduction and/or refresher.
The quizzes are also too heavy on the trivia - "who published what when" questions rather than critical thinking questions about why or how.
Even though I really liked it and got the best of it .
It was supposed to take 3 hours but it took me more like 50 hours.
Also, a lot of time is spent on the more intuitive aspects of Model Builder, but little to none is allotted to troubleshooting and the less intuitive aspects (for example, how to incorporate variables throughout a model or other issues with generalising a custom tool built within Model Builder).
If taking the course, be aware that the final submitted assignment requires formulating your own research question and unless you're already working in the field, can necessitate a significant amount of literature review for even the given example research questions.
course content was great, but I felt like the course left me hanging....
Hands-on experience should be given to be more interactive.
Might be a good introduction for those completely new to computational tools, but not useful for those with any background in git or R. Can be safely skipped.
Good content but the communication is not so great.
The topic and the class content itself are good, but the introduction is too brief.
There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions.
Other than that, very interesting, well-presented material.
However this was not what I personally was looking for although one learns about dementia, alzheimer, etc, which is interesting as they will affect most of us in someway or another.
Frustrating to finish without the exact linkts to the data.
Compared to the other courses, this one is kind of boring, but learned some origination of dogs :)
Its good, but I feel a little bit of disparity between the level of detail given in lecture vs the reading.
It was very interesting and quite simple to follow!Indicative for beginners!
You can take that book and learn it yourself.
Good information for the absolute novice in time management.
If providing some basic reading or keynote before hand would be really helpful!
It touched upon all currently employed techniques in good detail.
Great professor and good content.
The biggest problem with this course is the quizzes: not challenging and requires no critical thinking.
Introduces the basics well with a good emphasis on the underlying math.
I would also appreciate having some additional materials on the brain areas in this course, since this area was completely new to me.
I take care of the business of two eCommerce sites that sell wine and Parmesan cheese.
Over all a good course though!
More like general intro to each tool and data sources.
I really like the visiting writer seminars -- they were the best part
I suppose it doesn't matter because I did pass and received my certificate.
Therefore, I can only guess at my solutions.
its good and still more programming problems can be discussed to ease the learners to dive interest in R.
The class and the content is very good!
It wasn't challenging but more irrelevant to what I'd guess is a lot of "workplaces"
The videos really need updates!
Good information and assignment design, but please just have someone on your team go through this.
Really enjoyed and learned a lot from the case study from reality.
Expect to pick up independently most of the things that are being taught.
It can be included an application project to practice the concepts learned, in order to improve this course.
The subject of the course is very interesting.
If you don't then just search the web for tutorials on Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Also, I don't really think all the intro to programming stuff should be in this class.
Very short, easy and introductory course.
The video instruction are not as helpful as I wished.
I think this course was way too ambitious.
Focus is definitely on project planning and not so much on project management.
In spite of this course being very basic it give you a quick highlight on the fundamentals of management principles.
Useful but a little bit fluffy (but i guess so is the topic).
The material is good, the presentation (the speaker) is awesome: clear spoken and at a good pace.
i found the questions in the quiz to be a bit vague.
I probably spent 30 hours in all completing the assignment because I had to spend so much time looking up material that was not covered in the lectures.
I took a similar one on Udemy (that was free) just after I completed this one and it was 10x easier to understand and closed so many loops I had when learning JavaScript.
What background do I really need?
Can't be completed without payment
It would be great to make a voice-over in English as well
Turi stopped working on SFrame (at least on Github), and SFrame does not supports Python 3.
Dr. Greg Urban is extremely knowleadgeable on the topic.
The reason why I am not giving the course a higher rate is because: 1) I find the pace of the course is quite slow, 2) the inactivity in the discussion forums and the lack of peer reviews in the assignments reduces its interactivity and 3) both the contents and grading system are very theoretical.
Still, I would recommend this course as it provides a solid foundation on the principles behind the dynamics of culture.
Course material looked sometimes recycled and unstructered
Overall good course with a lot of examples.
A good course taking into account that it does not require previous knowledge.
The assignments are quite challenging and the disadvantage is, that they are not connected to the lectures and are therefore not well explained.
However I found the course structure quite repetitive over the seven weeks: Every other module is structured in the same way: "Which fruit do you like?
I think this is an excellent course.
Not just overview.
And, need more involvement/engagement from students, need multiple (randomized per attempt) questions in quizzes, need participation from course producers/TAs for questions and clarifications needed by students (in discussion forums).
The assignments are a lot of do-it-yourself by reading documentation and Q&A sites.
The cartoons and animations used in this course really make statistics a lot easier and interesting.
At first I though it was a very poor course but certain parts of it were gold for me and I got a lot out of it.
If the quality of guided meditations (GM) in following classes are even half the quality of this course's GM's, then that's all the reason I need to continue the future classes, too.
Course gotchas:#1.
If you have a positive outlook on Buddhism but do not know the ins and outs of the religion/practice I do not recommend this course.
Also it's difficult to check when long code snippets should be pasted as plan text in short text field.
To me, it appears to be a no-brainer to use any one of those DBs to store, modify and massage my data.
As an example: iNACOL (National Association for Online and Blended Learning) is referred to many times in the video lectures and was transcribed in the text in a number of different ways: "Ian Nicole", "Inacles" and "iNickel."
Teaches a lot of important stuff, but a bit fast paced for my liking.
As they say a Macro-overview.
Too often the details are thrown at us without being properly framed in the context or without having the proper concept being introduced progressively.
I have a theory about teaching since I was 15, and so far it has proven to be true.
Presentation is good.
As for me, I appreciate non-academical knowledge.
The assignments did not have you actually perform any analytics activities.
I didn't enjoy the podcasts.
Good intro
The course does an OK (but not great) job at teaching Data Structures.
But I have a strong feeling that would be nice to have more focus on the practice.
Research the web for additional exercises if you want to learn something here.
Good food for thought
To me that was drawing the idea that the Almighty Creator does not exist.
or how the meteor achieve what it does.
If I could give that part a negative score I would, actually an imaginary number would be better.
I totally liked the hands-on approach and the nice presentation of the material.
It's more like a sort of refresher/inspiration course.
I learned some interesting Tools about Learning.
I did have learned something new but I'm not yet sure if it's useful or not.
All this could've been written in a PDF instead of videos.
Pro Tools is a global standard for recording, editing, mixing and mastering.
There exist some sort of help for solving programming.
However, those bad quiz as well as not so comprehensive courses design totally ruin it.
All of the other submissions praise the course, so maybe it is just me, but none of the other submissions mentioned any actual things the course had done - just that it was great.
It got me thinking of how ignorant clever people continue to be!
There should have been more examples and more use case and more applied rather than just a theoretical discussion
Would be nice if they had some real data processing exercises to demonstrate someof the concepts.
(I posted this review in a blog [https://guhyasamajacenter.
wordpress.
com/2015/10/03/review-of-the-free-coursera-tibetan-buddhist-meditation-and-the-modern-world-lesser-vehicle-course-given-by-uva/].
It's Ok though.
Long and unbalanced course.
but anyway i
Later assignments can be hard to get exactly right due to bugs in QSTK and also uncertainty around event counts.
According to the NHS in the UK condom failure rate is 2%, not 15% as stated in this course.
If I did not have a working knowledge of academic French, I would have been lost.
I have done the first 2 parts and I am half way through the 3rd and I am finding some of the information to be inaccurate.
so it doesn't confuse people3.
Major focus was on using Design Thinking tool.
The only downside was the lack of reference material.
Mostly useful practical advice and examples on how to use Excel to model risks and realities.
The grading criteria requires features that aren't mentioned in the instructions.
good for beginners.
But the course content is very simple, somewhat too simple for the course title, it only touches on very very basic of javascript.
Sometimes the guest lectures are not even related to the content of the modules where they are presented.
materials didn't cover everything necessary for assignments, and time requirement was not clear
But, otherwise.. Great, great course from a beginners point-of-view!
Graphlab is immensely powerful, however not adopted in industry making it hard to apply the learning in real world.
excellent for me and my carrier
Although the course covers interesting subject areas, I feel like the various topics should have been explored to a greater depth.
It was a great experience!
Valuable and very well organized, I found it quite simple
Good but not deep enough.
The specialization is great, and the course breadth and topics described in each is equally good.
It is a very light course!
Overall is good course with many exercises, forum is supportive, however mentors/instructors never answered my questions (i guessed they bothered only with the very first session when course was launched) Language is sometimes overly complicated and hard to grasp the main principles of the algorithm (e.
g.
The lectures are well presented and the exercises useful.
Assessments are way harder than the taught content, be aware to spend way more time on them than the estimates.
Also, side note, if you have a Mac, you will be somewhat flustered at times, and you will also need an add-on app for the Histogram portion.
I found the pronunciation of the Italian lecturers very difficult to understand at times and I am English, if I hadn't had the transcript I wouldn't have been able to complete this course to the level I like to perform at.
Assignments would need to be improved...
Interviews were very valuable.
Not always, but it would be in this case.
I am sorry to say, but I think this course helps me little
The final negotiation homework was very interesting, and useful in internalizing the concepts.
I can't help wondering if this was as a result of some of the negative feedback posted on the forums in the earlier courses of this specialisation.
Long paragraphs are a pain to read.
Some lectures are presented in very flat boring to follow manner.
The course strongly aims for USA residents who eat too much.
Maybe these should be changed to keep the ideas fresh.
On the one hand, I learned a lot which merits the three stars.
BC, done to address complaints about no coverage of Alexander and Macedon, feels tacked on.
Tom Mosher is fantastic in the tutorial forums - would have spent many hours wandering aimlessly if it wasn't for his guidance.
I still believe though that the general message remains very generic and would benefit from further technical details to go more in depth.
Clean and elegant style of presentation.
This makes a huge difference.
I would also focus more heavily on database schemas in this second course relative to the first.
This course took a lot of work to create.
Excited to apply the knowledge and learn concrete skills in the upcoming courses within this specialization.
It is a very basic course to give you high level of what the course is going to cover and the tools that will be used throughout the course.
the swirl exercise along with the course makes much more sense
Only positive thing was that i realized how messed up my life is.
Overall its a interesting course, it is obvious that a lot of effort was made while creating it and you can definitely learn something from it
This course is a must if one wants to understand the reasoning behind the creation of certain institutions and instruments.
The professor is great but the course feels rushed through.
I think the course should include some self study materials for student and every topic should include more information and example.
That one single week of course can literally help so many companies/NGOs.
could definitely flow better
I would recommend University of Michigan's Programming for Everybody (Python) over this course.
I also did not find the peer review process to be that productive as a grading tool.
This course is very instructive and well-paced like the others in the specialization.
But as the course progresses, much of the footage is of him at his desk, and the closeups become more and more extreme, the hand-waving and fist-clenching approach sheer windmilling, and the exaggerated eye-rolling, grinning and so forth become so distracting that I can't bear to watch.
And of course more of phonetics.
Theory is too much.....
Useful course for exposure to debates that animate the common law, with some bits about the relationship of English and European law, pre-Brexit.
Mostly because the peer reviews were strict and unforgiving and as an experienced, essay writer, I didn't feel I needed the rigid, boring academic structure required for this assignment.
There are issues with submitting assignments (failure to process submission in Coursera).
Peer reviews may not be the best solution, as we have to wait a long time for our work to be reviewed!
It would be great if more time was spent on actual explanation of main concepts, since many here are the beginners in stats.
It's amazing that we live in an age where you can take online classes like this for free.
I went from not knowing my way around Ableton to being able to make simple tracks in a few weeks.
The course load is pretty light, but it makes it easy to stay motivated and keep up from week to week.
The instructor has her quirks, but don't we all.
Would have loved more guidance towards the assignments.
I expected a lot from this course but it could have been a lot better - lengthy videos, not trying to explain the concepts in an understandable ways.
I have a totally different outlook on it now that I wish I didn't have.
It was difficult for me to understand her way of teaching and I felt the lectures didn't flow correctly.
Also, what is the point of breaking them into 3 minute chunks?
Perhaps "The Influence of the Arts on Social Action" would better define the intent of the course.
Good course otherwise.
Wish he could speak everything fluently.
Looking forward to the technical portion of the Specialization.
Good course with varied content and I very much liked the way it was build up (individual, business, cities, nations).
A lot of the topics covered were presented very fast and not having the slides to review the materials made my experience in learning very frustrating.
The professor answered in his lecture videos some of my basic questions about advertising, but I don't think that he made the class very exciting and I didn't feel motivated to seek out outside material.
I would defitenely reccomend it to learners who are new to the industry.
mongodb unbounded arrays).
It only covers the very basic and core topics.
Beginners will probably be better off reading a wikipedia article or any general chemistry textbook.
But I still think there is a lot of room for improvement.
The content is good, but the way the lectures are given not so much.
However, it would be better if there were more hands-on exercises on relevant stuff.
I believe they try to fix the bugs and use the 'trustworthy' autograder so students can rely on the feedback provided the autograder.
While I found the content and instructors to be very good, I don't feel I received any true constructive criticism that will help me with my writing.
We are not learning how to make the autograder not generate errors.
Prof Rob Stone is a very good speaker and has made the videos very informative.
The content is very small, which is good because it makes the course very lean, but bad because it merely scratches the surface of project management world.
Fun course but everything was already covered on the Fundamentals Of Graphic Design Course.
Thank you
I also think that the shiny videos from Rstudio are better than the instructional videos in this course.
I personally did feel that there is a lot of repetition and this course did not help much .
In an effort to structure each session in the same way, detail has been missed out.
I would prefer more intermediate steps to confirm we're on the right track.
The presenter is good and knowledgeable, but the information is barely skimmed over and there isn't any real opportunity to learn.
Again, the content is valuable and solid, but that in and of itself does not make for a good course.
I think that this course could be offered for free and maybe the others are worth paying for.
As a guy from Machine Learning field, its models and concepts are so easy and simple for me, so it's lack of challenge.
As I am an elderly and retired audit-only student and have NO interest in getting a certificate or using the course for college credit, I found that off-putting and dropped the class.
I found it to easy to just move on and not really look for the comments on my work.
Anyone that has spent considerable time working in Excel will find this pretty limited.
I found Pr.
Germano a bit stiff in his teaching and it was very hard for me to follow his classes.
Quizzes at the end of each week would be helpful.
Good intro course on software product management.
For example, in the first programming assignment, why if the ModelProvider object already computed the entire map of ratings, and the map is directly needed in the Recommender object, the Model object only provide API to retrieve individual rating but not the entire map?!
There are some weird questions.
too basic for me, excellent for programming newbies
But not latest.
Overall, however, the 4 course series was excellent.
Los documentos adjuntos son extremadamente necesarios para disfrutar del curso!It was so interesting and useful.
However, there are some interesting concepts I can take along in my further studies, but I am slightly disappointed.
I think it will be nice if I can have a diagnostic survey to test whether this course is suitable for me or not before the course.
Some of the videos seem to kind of drag on a bit as well, but overall it was still helpful for developing my game despite feeling like I didn't gain much new information.
These may be such that they require reading the referred text in addition to watching the videos.
Too short, too expensive.
I understand that is also required to understand the subject.
This course provided me with some vital knowledge about health and nutrition, however, I consider it to be very short and rather shallow.
I struggled a lot with the presenter of this course.
But the question "correction" (the explanation text you receive after submitting, as justification for what the correct answer is) referred to the concept of "two-sided hypothesis test".
The focus on the history of economic schools and world economy is a highlight which provides lively background for the dull economic concepts.
For some, other approaches have worked well and might not be ready to switch philosophies based on the course.
Otherwise, pretty good.
Looking forward to the next step in Designing the Organization
Overall, this was good study for learning basic functions in Excel.
Because if this, watching the videos aren't much help visually, but then it's an uneasy listen because the audio levels in the videos are so uneven, that you can barely hear the professor's voice on a common speaker, and then you get BLASTED when he turns on an audio clip.
The way he explained things also felt a bit slow and dragging to me.
I think this course could be integrated into the other ones of the specialization, or, if it is meant to be just a course to get an overview, be free of charge.
Would have been better if the online portions of the MOOC reflected a wide range of speakers.
Hey, this is EXCEL, not advanced calculus!
A good introduction, but it would be nice to learn a little more about written Chinese and some basic grammar.
Not all the DSDs were useful, and some of the content is very dated (such is the nature of a MOOC that isn't maintained), but it was useful to learn about methodologies and tools to think creatively about issues and solving problems.
I did learn things about the way I think and the way I learn.
Html and CSS were excellent!I'm sure this is a great course for people with some coding background, but as a complete beginner to Javascript and coding, I found it nearly impossible to comprehend the 3rd and 4th weeks because we jumped in to Jquery without first getting to know Javascript.
Yes - the quizzes were too easy - I passed all of them even when I wasn't understanding most of the material.
I went over to CodeAcademy and Microsoft Virtual Academy to get a better foundation in JS, then came back and was able to understand a bit better.
Good intro and fundamentals, but focuses far too much on finance.
If you are just interested in neuroscience but it is not your specialty (like me, a medical student), then this course is not beneficial for you.
Prof.
For example, a possible assignment could be the implemention of a counter on a Web page using JavaScript or the creation of a web page with buttons, emerging messages, menus etc.
Definitely a useful course, I will be interested to see how it relates to the real world of derivatives pricing.
After years ,the math part of the course was difficult.
And I would have liked more practice quizzes.
What I found is just a lot of buzzwords and very shallow overviews.
The course Is a great intro touches on some of the important subjects but it lacks the depth required to cover the topic appropriately.
It shouldn't be named Introduction to HTML 5.
I gained much from this course.
I loved the first three weeks for the really well presented background information.
?
great course, but module 4 lacks a bit in structure.
Hard to grasp and follow.
This course is very basic for a person with an IT background, but nevertheless might come in handy for people without relevant experience.
It's globally a nice course, although you have to keep in mind that it is more like an introduction to the topic rather than a real, full course.
I would have liked to put 5 stars.
To me , you were preaching to the choir.
The course introduces us to a ton of valuable material for developing data products.
It also seems more geared towards high-school or university students than towards the general public, so maybe I was just not in the target audience.
It became increasingly hard to follow the ideas as I had no visuals to support the text.
too superficial in the discussed ideas
I felt dejected each time the instructor said not to worry about getting it right and just experiment -- that's easy to say if you aren't being graded.
BUT, it is not well monitored, the peer review process is broken and questions are not answered, making it frustrating.
This give a very good insight into what i did not know earlier.
Great course although I did struggle through the very last assignment.
Not a beginner course.
Great course to introduce you to basics of graphic design and basic design language.
The course had many information provided and thanks for that.
Very theoretical course.
Loved going through the videos and assignments.
I was able to follow the course and keep the pace but I got lost on factorial ANOVA.
The element which really doesn't work is the peer assessment or review.
Other big history courses I've taken do not go into specific date and time detail, period by period But function more in terms of how preceding events may be causative for future events (more like a butterfly effect analysis over long periods of time).
If you are looking for more detailed specific history than this course is useful.
Less required reading and more targeted lectures would make it great.
The beginning is well prepared, interesting and informative, the end is undercooked, subjective and repetitive.
Also The section on the back-end of MatPlotLib was more detailed than it needed to be for quick overview but not detailed enough to be very useful.
Requiring people for instance to build additional data types already taught (lists, dictionaries) would have been at least little more challenging.
Overall it is a good basic intro class.
There are similar or even better content available in other courses which are truly open and that request for payment if the student wish to get the certificate.
Wrong positioning of University of Genève offering this MOOC from an economical point of view.
Quizzes failed to correlate to the material in the lectures.
javascript part is not covered in depth
I was trying to help you to help us learn better, if that makes sense.
M
Teaches a lot of the basics but all the numbers are outdated (from 2013)there is minimal use of this being a video course.
The course was very informative but the slides were a little boring.
Most of the lectures were very short.
All in all, it was a good class for basic financial knowledge (e.
g.
Many detailed points were glanced over and one prescribed reading material (Peterson, E. T. (2004).
The course is very interesting and challenging but there are mistakes in the videos and too much mathematical theory with relation to examples.
good course
The fact that there is a 60 year old man sitting at a table is the antithesis of what this course should be to be honest.
Very good course, only 1 BIG disadvantage: you cannot take the quizzes unless you buy the certificate...
Also the lectures were short and fast at times, the instructor would move thru the demos so quick or show pages and not provide a detail description of what we were looking at, making things very confusing.
Good course for a free one.
Finally I had to wait weeks to have my assignment marked and there is still conflicting information on the course page - in 'grades' it shows I didn't pass the week 4 task.
The courses in this specialization are - in my opinion, excessively short.
For a seven-week course this was not challenging enough.
This course might help you on awareness on your own abilities.
I have no instructions on how to "verify" it.
The course was challenging, and although I would have liked a bit more information from the video lectures, and a bit more practice on using the basic functions, I learned a lot.
I thought the video lectures were a little sparse.
This would of helped learn the symbols better.
A beginner most definitely needs more time to spend on the course than the hours estimated.
Some videos were a bit long though.
This course offers great background instruction on Machine Learning and I would give it 5 stars except for the following:First, there doesn't seem to be any moderation of the session discussions except for help from other students.
I think one or two example for a principle may make some concepts more clear and can be understood easier.
The instructor goes super slowly and spends a lot of time on unnecessary stuff.
Often times I had to submit a version and redo it after I started working through the grading criteria during peer review.
Decent information covered, however I felt like this was more of a course on responsive design than specifically information design.
However, that helps make it good as an introduction.
I enjoyed the course and I will continue with the specialization.
one "upload" button is enough in the assignment .
However this course was very complicated and had way too much math for my taste.
Also correct some errors.
The revisions are not made by the tutor.
Could be shorter with the related contents.
An update is needed!
Very good course, but I did't like how the last week focused on test taking.
The first course in this series was really good and this one was so-so at best.
I suggest that add 2 more weeks to this course.5.
It is possible to adapt most tips but I think that could enrich the course.
The teaching voice should be more active.
This is a trend in MOOCs and I don't think it can be helped, but perhaps more assignments that help understand the concepts better with examples would help students go beyond.
The lectures weren't always easy to follow but the quizzes were really useful as they meant it was necessary to understand the material.
You'll need to have a thorough grounding in dictionaries and lists for this module, so make sure you're across the concepts and syntax of those data structures :)
helped me to get some basic knowledge on Project Management process
A more in depth study of ggplot would probably be more beneficial as I felt like we were only scratching the surface with it
tiny increments per week
Not the biggest problem once you get used to it, because the course is an overview, but it's still kind of annoying and not very professional compared to other courses available.
The instructor is clearly very pro-capitalism, which is a mixed bag.
The course has less homework - 3 tasks each week as comparing to 5 in AT.
A lot of time devoted to the job stuff may not be super relevant for most students, and was certainly not super relvant too.
In the future I would like more emphasis on recent or current Scandinavian film including actors, actresses, cinematography techniques, etc.
It needs work to narrow the gap as this is not good learning, it frustrates many and is not helpful.
The terms are not always the same and it's sometimes confusing.
For example, for the first essay, I wrote it out in ESSAY form as was specified and had all of the required points written out exactly how it was instructed.
Although I really liked the content of this course, the videos seemed to be have been done with rush.
Well done and Thank You!
The course lacks coherence which comes as a big disappointment as it follows two excellent modules by Greg Northcraft.
Many of the assessment questions ask about issues which are either overly specific or simply incorrect (this is a very small percentage, but it is noticeable).
Too much basic stuff about Twitter and how everything works in detail.
Could have been better with more practical approach.
Week 2, 4 and especially 5 have good summaries of the videos and examples, but week 3 almost only has links to wikipedia...- The final exam is VERY difficult.
A good course, giving a thorough understanding of the various types of renewable energy, their issues and opportunities.
This okay, but I whish there would be more case studies and practical examples.
too repetitive and too much dialogue bullshit
Statistical Inference was my 6th course.
It was too simpleI did other free MOOCs that had much more.
The videos were like reading a book.
Some parts were very useful.
what is taught is not sufficient for quizzes.
Overall easy to watch and good lessons.
If someone is completely new to AI then it is a bit much to expect the infographic to be magazine quality.
I think that in time, and working in the Social Media department of a company, I would get the chance to see the interest of Lexalytics but I DID NOT understand anything related to Bluemix...
Any prior knowledge of programming is likely to render it useless to the student.
For me, I don't need badges or certificates, but I do like being able to access and do everything within a course.
It's really too bad because he clearly has a lot of knowledge that could be used to popularize thinking about the unwritten constitution.
I found it useful as a recap of things I learned in high school (!)
So from one side it helped me to move forward with my idea but on other hand I didn't get any professional feedback and advices from teacher.
I would not recommend this course for someone wishing to learn SQL as it is not the main focus, it is only a small part of the lessons.
once again, brief intro that lacked a lot of how to do it actually, pasting code suddenly wasn't fun at all, but overall, the load was easy to grasp but totally needs more practice
content is great and direct to the point.
I believe the course would benefit from a more in depth discussions of the artworks.
I found they were an effective way to learn
Sachs is doing valuable work and I like the premise of the course very much.
And the lack of communication on the discussions by the professor, was quite unbelievable.
In fact, I know some professional Web programmers that they don't use javascript to manipulate images but in some cases when it is really necessary.
I have mixed feelings about this course.
she seems very friendly and kind but some contents are a little bit borried and difficult.
Good course :)!
There has been very few on-hands training.
I can sum up the whole lesson in that as "Game designers create pieces and level designers put those pieces together in interesting ways."
Stands well in the specialization.
You need improve this course still.
In many instances it would have been nice if there had been a second take of the video taken to prevent potentially confusing mis-speaking from making it into the lectures.
All assignments are very typical, just copy-paste from lecture exercises.
The course material doesn't explain the interpretation o
The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking.
The reason that I've only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework.
The content for teaching how to create website is nothing.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed the delivery of the instructor.
The lectures sometimes sound "babble" and cannot explain even easy things.
It is usually impossible to get the minimum of 80% in a quiz.
You must do extra study to respond.
Unfortunately, there were a lot of spelling errors and grammatical mistakes in the written portions.
Good course to start with the basics of photography.
Many videos often don't show any code or very little which makes understand syntax difficult.
Information provided are good.
Still, it gave me a good background on the issues, and I would take more classes from the same institution.
The quiz questions were not clear enough sometimes.
I think more time could have been spent on the videos and more information could have been relayed to the students.
Intresting sinds my volunteering job with Coderdojo Belgium and my teaching job in 8th grade.
Exercises should be better designed and I think that first week of this course and the whole previous one are too basic.
You could have easily googled it.
I wish teachers look at our work too rather than student though they do their jobs.
The instructor was just talking, not teaching nor explaining, just like someone who prepares notes and is reading to students.
It is a good introductory course, but it could be optional for people with some experience in the field, as it is very basic.
Five stars for the excellent teachers and content, but the course is not made for Coursera: very long videos, slides full of words, many references to the group work for the course at JHU, tiny quizzes and just two practical assignments.
Not needed for people you have already done data science specialization in coursera
So you're forced to read a lot, and learn more than actually necessary.
If you are new in the learning of business model generation is a choice to start with.
Galaxy seems to me out of date.
for the small time commitment each week relative to the potential life-long benefits.
Easy to understant the basic concepts of python, including variables, loops, exception handler, etc.
Another thing...
Good course for beginers
I was a bit disappointed though that the level was pitched quite low and so didn't answer a lot of the questions I have.
Too easy for me
The biggest downside of the course is that instead of learning on open source machine learning modules (sklearn) the course offers Dato's GraphLab, a proprietary piece of software that requires paid licenses to operate.
To be clear, during the duration of the course students can use a student license that provides graphlab for free but this expires after a year.
Very easy to understand!
(That's just my opinion, I guess.
Currently there is zero feedback on completed assignments, which does not aid learning.
For those 3 quizzes, I took them so many times all the other answers are memorized and I just keep trying to get that one right.
Teaching level is not good, very difficult to follow.
The interactive segments could be better.
Couldn't hear the videos
Especially if I'm paying to learn from a professional in a field, I'd expect to receive some feedback and assessment from that pro.
Another area of improvement is that there were several instances where videos repeated things covered in previous videos.
First we're talking about Ottoman reforms, then a diversion into Goethe (or some other dour Teutonic thinker) then a tangent into- but we'll cover that in another video so in 1924, but if you read L'etranger....
I could see this course being perfect if broken down into two classes.
But the videos and quizzes help me a lot to understand.
This was an informative class.
Thank you for this course.
There are excellent presentations by the professor, but in it's current format the course is too short for the amount of technical knowledge implicit in the material.
Not BAD!
I learned more about using Tableau from it that the prior courses in the specialization.
It wastes a week talking about theoretical complexity when it could have been used for something more productive.
But I expected to dive a little more in some details.
was expecting more on this.
The selection of content is very good.
You can get stuck with a failed assignment for weeks and you have to kindly ask in the forums for someone to review it.
The subject is interesting, but the explanations are a little confusing.
So while this course "opens the treasure chest," it leaves you a long way from publishable
Also many of the programming problems do not have the sufficient level of clarity.
Every task depends on having completed the previous task perfectly.
Very good, I missed a deepening of Storytelling elements
Good idea for content and good content except poor support from Moderator.
Thanks!
insightful, inspirational mostly, informative, but gives an impression of a false pep-talks.. the lecturer is very nice but the over-accentuated humor and false bonding with the audience diminishes the overall good feeling of the course
Tests are quite simple, more suitable for high school, probably.
The assignments were very helpful as I was able to prepare for the 1st day of teaching.
Very good course but with a few OUTDATED materials.
This Course needs a Update, im really disappointed of Week 4 and the Assignments are Outdated and nothing new
Basic science.
It is quite good course for beginners those are Latin-Language-speaking people.
I found the course useful to better ground and assimilate the ideas presented in the first one.
But on the other hand, as mentioned by other learners, I do find it a little too much on the commercial side.
I did find very interesting to learn to use some of the tools such as Klout.
At later stages also , examples should be used for explanation !
The course doesn't aim to dig deep into its topics.
Also, the title is somewhat misleading and the presumptions that the course creators make about its students assume I am a business guy sitting in an office or a part of some team which makes the activities that you HAVE to do in order to pass the course a bit harder to complete.
make it more interective
As others have stated, but clearly not adjusted, some of the quiz questions aren't clear items covered in the material (which is frustrating).
The answer "all of the above are correct" is neither true nor false, as only one of the answers in the 'all' is the exception."
But, it doesn't cover all the theory needed to actually write flight control software for a quad copter.
Tedious course.
Way too easy..
I believe beginners should enroll in another Python course or self-study more on the side to fully grasp the concepts.
A bit fast paced as they teach so many things in a single week.
Maybe a short course in Liner Algebra could be included on Coursera also I have noted some of the assignments are a few years old as I have seen a few attempts to solve these on the web dating back to 2011.
While I ultimately did learn the topics through my own research, I feel the class would have been much more beneficial with slower, more indepth explanations.
illustration is not enough for the commands.
That is not really 'humble'/ Smacks at times of academic pretension.
Not much substance to take from this.
The explanations are a little hard to follow as well.
Lot of jargon introduced without explanation.
The glitches with Coursera itself are not excusable and should be taken as a black mark against the organization.
I learned from the course.
Great course; only limited by the requirement for peers to review the assigned visualization to complete the course.
It's very confusing to see the wrong code typed in and then the correct code.
Many lectures are several years old and still have typos in them.
this did not seem like a class.
Therefore only 3 stars.
Not one a statistics newbie should take, had to take it twice just to grasp 80%
I am working as an organisational consultant and thought this would add some knowledge - however it is really difficult to follow because it seems repetitive to me...
You need to have some familiarity though with programming in general.
Felt like the first draft of a team-taught course
This course is way too much concentrate on studies for students, not well correlate with studies for everybody
There are a number of issues with this course, and more generally Coursera.
Same applies to the textbook, e.
g.
This class is more of just a vague overview of the other courses.
The course teaches you very valuable basic R programming skills.
A mentor replied to another student who pointed out this conumdrum on the Week 7 Forum with: "I understand where you are coming from Phil, but only one of the answers as an individual answer is incorrect.
less interactive
The instructor is very dry and the mat
A good intro to PR , but course material seemed somewhat redundant and lacked challenge at times.
Decent overview but could have spend more time showing plotting techniques in more detail than showing what makes an appealing plot.
If you make the assignments easier to submit (for example: provide a box to write a statement as opposed to uploading one) it will remove frustration and increase enjoyment.
Somehow, the pace is too fast.
It is an important topic and there is limited amount of offerings (the Wharton course in accounting analytics crosses in the benfords law topic).
Also, I may have not been well prepared for it.
The course (and especially the final project) requires a good basis in statistics beforehand.
The assistants are super helpful and patient.
The overwhelming majority of reviews were simply "very good", "excellent", and "nice job".
thanks
Need more handholding for understanding of concepts and review/explanation of the quiz results will reinforce learning further.
Thank you very much!
I found nothing about that.
The audio can be difficult to understand.
Having said that, perhaps it would be wise to charge less for this initial course or even offer it for free.
It makes it how to visualize the concepts.
Course can be more comprehensive.
This course is deceivingly full of content.
Week 3 was almost useless; had it not been for a good reading provided for an assignment, it was too basic.
Add some specificity in the course or name it Basics of Research Methods.
Is not as bad as I thought at the beginning (the first two weeks).
on the last assignment, if the programmer uses a different rounder implementation that returns subtly-different results, though the results print out as the same to the rounded degree of precision.
The Grader should be written to accept results that are "acceptably close" to the desired result, e.
g.
Useful but as with the first course of the specialization very light on content
Course content good but a little too basic in my eyes.
I missed a sense of continuity as we skipped from model to model with a minimum of time spent on how the models complement each other and their relative strengths and weaknesses in application.
The way data structures were defined in the code was particularly difficult to deal with.
There were some good modules in this course and the assignments were helpful in applying the principles.
Hence, hoping that these shortcomings will be sorted out as and when the course profile is updated.
This one is quite easy.
One unit in particular was very confusing.
This course mainly focus on statistics and statistical parameters and almost nothing about about Understanding Clinical Research - as title anotate
Lectures are good and easy to understand, both visuals and speak are nice and clear.
To improve specially content organization: firt week is very heavy comparing with the others.
Do note it's very possible that I'm biased because I have seen more of the material from this course than the regression course.
Also, for those who know nothing about the sience part of lipids, carbohydrates and trace elements, in generall, it constitutes a very informative ''package'' for everyone.
I did not finish the course, but the assignments were entirely too pointless for me to take seriously enough to continue.
This is more reference guide rather than a real training course.
I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one.
But to be incorporated into the very first module of this pathway it seems doing so is, what it seems like most introductory programming courses invoke, and, is quite a leap to embark upon especially without first being offered stepping stones sufficient enough to feel certain you have adequate understanding to be able to sift through the information provided and subsequently decide upon which aspects are relevant in order to attempt to accomplish the tasks set that ultimately form to complete the final project.
Its actually through being guided by the experts whose teachings highlight to newcomers through practical visual sessions where we actually begin to learn where these interconnections link between these chunks of informational topics - all of which form the essential fundamental building blocks - and in so doing, that perhaps perceived initial 'spoon fed' approach then enables a newcomer to build sufficient skills and knowledge to then be able to actually 'develop' their confidence.
I enjoyed the assignments, apart from last one where the difficulty was more about the context of the example than any parallel programming aspects.
good to begin with!
Second the voice quality also need some improvement it was not clear.
Sub in spanish plz
It is very good explained but it is just an small introduction about how to use the Raspberry Pi in a IoT framework.
The best information was from the articles and books he recommends.
I liked it, although I felt like they were 2 courses: One for the first three weeks, another one during the last week.
The "First Course" was OK, but it was regular accounting stuff.
The Ancient Marine Reptile class did a much better job of presenting this info although it did some laundry listing.
There was a great distance from what was taught in the lectures and what was asked for you to do in the assignments... and It's not a matter of knowing how to program.
I think there is need to provide clearer instructions on how to get the programming assignments done.
I would have hoped for a little more inspiration and diverse practical ideas.
Except for that , This is an excellent course material.
The content of this course is good but the production quality of the videos are not vary high.
Due to volume could perhaps be divided into smaller, more comprehensive,
In all, I feel like while I did learn, I perhaps learned some wrong practices too.
Particularly important in those time of crises in which, the raise of populism and far right political agenda is being used as a tool to assign responsibility to the EU to failures at national level.
Great experience and basic knowledge of PE & VC but too much theory, and no descriptions given about the assumptions made while valuation.
Clear and easy concepts for project management.
Surely, those non-paying students could still submit assignments, it is possible in other courses why not this one?
The course is video heavy but short on practice.
Need to add more examples and contents for this class.
The concepts are easy to understand, it's the way they are worded and jumbled.
He then goes into these very specific, typical academic-style examples that he spends time talking about them (again pointless).
The course is helpful.
But there are not many practice exercises.
It's quite easy.
Compared to other courses in the creative writing specialization, I felt that this one needs some improvement.
Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.
Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skills for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.
Finally, many thanks to the teachers!
Decent coverage of the basics, but some of the data, tools and approaches used are out of date by 2-3 years which is particularly troublesome in the fast-moving social space.
It provides good resources and code, but if you get stuck, there's no help.
mentorship was great, but the video lectures were almost useless.
Course quality went downhill, compared to previous course in series.
Then the lectures got better, learning the basis outlines and structures of plot is useful.
This would be super helpful for showing my work to a future employer!
All in this course is about theoretic knowledge.
I have not really improved TBH.
Great course!
All in all, the particular course offers a very decent view of this very interesting world of strategy but there are many ways that it could provide an even better experience and knowledge.
The MOOC was good and full of hidden treasures.
Being more a visual learner I had a very hard time with how the math was covered in this in the course, I need a slide that is specifically V is XXXX, R is XXXX so I have a reference point and I found with most examples given I was having to go back and forth between multiple items and transcripts to gt what I needed.
Introductory course to data structures.
A thorough introduction to ruby on rails.
The instructor may know what he is talking about but takes a rather unstructured approach to articulating it.
Brian Caffo is explaining the Statistical Inference methodically, but he could work on making the lectures less tiresome and monotonous.
It is a good start for those who want to have an healthier diet.
Could be done in a week.
I realize that this is an overview but the field of secular Buddhism seems very shallow.
A very good for beginners.
The videos with real fraudsters were very good allowing to connect the theory to practice.
Also the one with the instructor's LinkedIn profile linked doesn't work because LinkedIn covers the content and wants you to create an account.
The course content is very backward and needs to be updated though the quiz and project parts were very good and I enjoyed completing the course.
Some good case studies and interesting content, but it's a 50,000 foot view of marketing.
I just hope the instructors focus on teaching content with more focus and clarity.
I enjoyed this course, but I was lost by the end.
Too easy.
If you have much programming background this course will be a breeze.
It's just exposition and quizzes.
Good overview of narrative and a breakdown of key story elements such as character and setting.
My complaint is that there is no one to contact regarding papers or questions.
Majority of the class was just copy from Stokes book.
The course information was fairly useful, but the execution not so much.
The first week, the teacher went through the entire plot of Harry Potter which seemed like a waste of time.
Too much short for a vast and challenging topic like digital manufacturing.
My assignment was mis-reviewed by my peers, clearly they did not read my paper, they just clicked randomly at the grading options.
Clear but the content is a bit too simple.
The theories are perfect, but a little simple for those who have already known them.
Nothing bad here, but not really specifically adapted for lifelong learning.
Nevertheless, I have learnt many useful things and I have now a great outlook on the asset management world.
To
Now that I have completed the course I'd like to give some feedback on how I think it was.1.
They were interesting and presented the subject matter in a concise way.
Teaching assistants or moderators should be made available for each course to help out with any conceptual or programmatic questions.
I rate this course as a three out of five because I feel that during the 'worked exercise videos' it would be much more helpful if only the correct code was shown.
A good overview of tools for juniors or university students just getting into things.
The material covered in the videos is too basic to be able to apply the principles to a larger programme.
So even though I emailed the instructors with no response, I managed to obtain some information from other student who were extremely dedicated and much more advanced.
Videos maintain high standard.
Topics were OK but the focus on R and no other tools is frustrating
average course not too good not too bad
No info about custom directives, $watch, digest cycle, etc.
I wanted some idea of how data science teams are typically structured for when I need to talk about my work to my chain of command and my peers and for interacting with other dedicated data science teams at my company.
Not really specific, just a broad indtroduction to data analysis.
The content of the videos is generally good and seems appropriately targeted but the sample essays are disappointingly trivial (and not terribly well written).
Sure, there are instructions on where to find the info, what structure should be followed,...
I found this course is not the full lectures of the original.
If you have some programming background, you will move through this very quickly.
Overall, I did pick up several helpful hints, so the course was worth it.
It has great content.
A good investment of your time.
Not enough materials covered, nor enough Java practice opportunity.
I can give you a list of other moocs around this and other subjects (film, writing, mat, entrepreneurship, photography...) for you to make relations and compare structures.
Some quiz questions ask about material that is not discussed until later lectures.
From my experience our brain (or at least mine) better learn this way.
It Should teach Python 3.
Don't do this on its own, it's quite useless as a standalone module
I prefer courses that follow a book, and this course didn't.
Finally, some of the explanations and definitions, though interesting, weren't often well tied together.
It is definitely not a class that can provide sufficient information to learn and build applications, but the individual's effort in passing the quizzes and the projects will.
Watching his videos, I felt like I was sitting is the lecture room with other students.2) I also enjoyed watching different researchers talking about their fields of study.
That's the best way to remember and get speed on simple things.
That is a laughable suggestion.
However, when i finished the course i couldn't see the certificate of accomplishment at least; it never showed up :( And now when i click on the option "Buy the course" the page redirects me to an address which doesn't exist.
Despite of this, I enjoyed this course a lot, as the first one!
It's ok, good for remeber concepts
Not that bad I've might have learned more visiting other MOOC like Openclassrooms where they give us more information about coding.
Programming assignments should have been made important and compulsory part of the course instead of just MCQ quizzes.
This is the reason why Andrew Ng's Machine learning on coursera appears very engaging.
I find the overall content to be very exciting but at times the lectures get a little boring and monotonous maybe.
Most videos are of Dr. Egger writing out algebraic equations and discussing them, the excel component of Mastering data in excel come via pre-made calculators as attachments that you for the most part need to figure out on your own.
If you do not have a good comfort level with stats then you will require more time to spend on understanding the spreadsheet and it’s use.
It would be fantastic if Dr Egger could go through the spreadsheets as a part of the video and show a couple examples, hopefully revisions down the road !It was challenging but not impossible, and if you do not challenge yourself how much are you really learning?Best of luck!
With all due respect, I just want to give some suggestion as a learner.
Overview with key terminology and process information.
We need less lectures and more application based courses.
I have expected a few more things here.
Learn R from somewhere else and then take this course.
Good course, but worth only for really basic learners.
But without a proper category-pattern, our brain is having a hard time to properly remember the detail-patterns or miss-associate them to the wrong category-pattern (which create even more confusion).
Hope it was helpful somehow...
Hi My name is Kapil Raj and i am from India.
At times for example I would look at the screen he was showing on the services running or docs and I was like where do I find this in BlueMix and what does all these nodes, services, etc.. mean?
However some of the important points have been skipped and focus has been limited at times.
The best part of the course were the lab assignments.
Hope quizzes were better in standard.
The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because I didn't find that there was much discussion on the discussion board.
but there was too little content!!!!
The course goes over the basic toolkit for data scientists.
Expect nothing else.
It's a good class and I learned a lot.
The writing instructor is great, and the ideas are good.
I just don't dream of money all the time.
The course limitations for free attendance get in the way of efficient learning though, using cheap tricks to manipulate you into buying, though I haven't seen these features used this way in other curses, I bet they're using what they teach to increase conversion using any way available.
The only issue is that everything is from the Israeli point of view - the course would benefit from some discussion/inclusion from other perspectives.
Although it still shall be better if there could be more detailed, academic study contents involved.
I feel it could have been shortened a tad bit and go more to the point.
I do look forward to the next course though as I am learning a great deal no matter what :)
Actually, careful reading not just browsing does take a lot of time, in fact, it takes way more time per week than claimed.
Also the matlab assignments have some minor mistakes which takes time to figure it out.
Would like some info from the perspective of non-managers.
It's much easier to do this now it's on the new Coursera platform :o)
Overall, I am not sure how to apply these ratios in my final project...
A Course In Tableau For Non-Professionals" or something like that.
The course is interesting, but the grading system needs to improve substantially.
For instance, how NPV and IRR actually works on Excel.
Variety is not a bad thing.
These answers are not made available to students in the free tier, which flies in the face of open learning.
Needs more in depth treatment of each section, additional materials( additional suggested reading would be nice), and more excitement from the professor.
Course is good to have since oit convers the topic from its very basic perspective.
If you would like to cover more fundamental concepts behind exploratory analysis I would recommend other sources.
Perhaps by putting the references for a lecture at the end of the lecture, where there is already a slide giving credit for the use of images.
Materials production is very poor in details, even for the key ones: typography, colours, thickness of the fonts and lines.
Please provide more lectures.
Formula's can be entered in many ways and even when right were often counted as wrong.
I'll bet it came in handy for those whose English was not as fluent, though.
Not sure it really covers functional programming design, it feels more of a brief introduction.
Do not be fooled by the course description.
I felt it needed a video on just learning the alphabet.
If so, what is it?
I did not enjoy this as much as the first course.
Problems with translation from Spanish to English creating confusion to non - Spanish students.
Learn something useful.
But a lot of content (40%) is for USA.
!everyone knows it !!
Maybe concepts were illustrated too general and briefly (not in details) but maybe this course is just a warm up for people who are not specialists in those fields.
The other courses of the specialization are way better.
Very basic.
It is helpful to include this component too.
For some reason, I cannot stand the way Cheri Alexander teach the class.
The quizzes were dull and basic stuff.
to help understand the concepts is not helpful and incomprehensible to me.
Also I think some ideas provided in the course could be better organized.
However, the lecturer is very appealing and credible.
Which makes it _very_ hard to keep focus and pay attention.
I would, however, have liked examples of a more visual nature (show don't tell).
Ironically, the course materials show disappointingly little concern for user experience or design.
was expected more practices
While it is a good class, I have a message that one of my assignments is passed by not verified.
the homework is getting easy
Also, in the audit version all quizzes are blocked.
It is a nice course, but it can go more deeply into theory and most classes could be summarized.
I traced the problem back to a tiny typo that I made in week 2 assignment.
The instructions are delivered well and the flow seems in order.
Not really a good idea to try this on a chromebook if you are just getting started.
The videos were often choppy, awkward, and cut off in the middle of sentences.
Its a good course but I expect more..
The slide set is too brief, was expecting more details with examples & visuals
We were introduced to Bootstrap, but not taught much about how to use it and how to structure our html for it.
I have leart that as a leader you need to communicate clearly the vision, set goals which are in line with the vision.
I found this course very useful and would recommend it to friends if they are interested
Covers a lot of info too fast!
I love learning the material but the learning environment is disappointing.
As the course progresses to the later weeks, the inconsistency between quizzes and lectures grows.
The course covers a lot of interesting topics i a short time, citing external documents, webpages and books; sometimes some questions in the quiz refer to external documents.
About the assignment: it start quite easy, about high concept, story bible, game design document, making the student write more and more detailed, focusing all the attention on the documents.
It made me think of many ways to represent the same image.
Good to absorb Scala as new language.
Peter Glanding is a very good teacher.
Cons: Too short and concepts explained too quickly.
This is not a beginner's course, so a decent grasp of the R language is necessary.
Was fully theorytical....
Need hands on practical things so that we can do things ourselves
It is also too easy to pass.
I found that the five points to learn for each module become overly distracting.
To US centered.
